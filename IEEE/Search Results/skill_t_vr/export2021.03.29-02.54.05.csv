"Design of a human-machine cooperation system to facilitate skilled work","T. Inaba; M. Hayashizaki; Y. Matsuo","Dept. of Control & Syst.

For example, during cutting work a skilled worker seems to give a great deal of attention to the reaction force from a workpiece to his tool and little variation of characteristics of the workpiece, and seems to adjust his processing force and direction for accomplishing the work. Thereby an appropriate human-machine cooperation that amplifies human sensitivity to variation of characteristics of the object is able to make the work easy. At first in this paper, the human-machine cooperation system that consists of a human, a robot manipulator with a tool and a workpiece is represented as a block diagram. In the system the manipulator is position controlled from two force signals measured at the interface between the human and the manipulator, and between the tool and the workpiece. Then it is indicated that two typical characteristics of the system, transfer characteristics from human force to tool position and its sensitivity function to variation of characteristics of the workpiece, are independently specifiable. Therefore, for example, it is possible that the system is designed simultaneously to increase the human force enabling heavy work with a slight force, and to transfer a small variation of characteristics of the workpiece to the worker with amplification. Finally, some experiments are carried out on the human machine cooperation system that simulates some simplified work.","1062-922X","0-7803-5731-0","10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=812546","","Man machine systems;Humans;Manipulators;Design methodology;Force control;Control systems;Design engineering;Force measurement;Drilling;Systems engineering and theory","industrial manipulators;cutting;position control;diagrams","human-machine cooperation system;skilled work;cutting;industrial manipulator;reaction force;robot manipulator;block diagram;position control;force signals;heavy work;experiments","","5","","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technology faculty of the latter institute could be compared with the former polytechnics in the UK; however by law the difference in the Netherlands is more strict between Universities (key words: academic, research, search for general laws, universal truth, trends and patterns) and Higher Vocational Education (main goal is vocationally related: preparing for future working life, training in skills and logic of a technology). For some disciplines, Product Design Engineering being one of them, it means that there is not a smooth transfer possible for students having acquired the Hogeschool title, Ing, to the University and the Ir title within a reasonable time span. At the other hand, in special cases like the Technical Business Science course at the university of Groningen, in which the vocational approach and expertise of Hogeschool lecturers is incorporated in the academic curriculum, the combination can be very beneficial.

Self-organization problems, intrinsic behaviors as well as effective learning and skill transfer processes in the context of robotic systems have been significantly investigated by researchers. Our work presents a new framework of developmental skill learning process by introducing a hierarchical nested multi-agent architecture. A neuro-dynamic learning mechanism employing function approximators in a fuzzified state-space is utilized, leading to a collaborative control scheme among the distributed agents engaged in a continuous space, which enables the multi-agent system to learn, over a period of time, how to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner without any prior task model. The agents comprising the system manage to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform by continuously exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space. For the specific problem setting, the proposed theoretical framework is employed in the case of two simulated e-Puck robots performing a collaborative box-pushing task. This task involves active cooperation between the robots in order to jointly push an object on a plane to a specified goal location. We should note that 1) there are no contact points specified for the two e-Pucks and 2) the shape of the object is indifferent. The actuated wheels of the mobile robots are considered as the independent agents that have to build up cooperative skills over time, in order for the robot to demonstrate intelligent behavior. Our goal in this experimental study is to evaluate both the proposed hierarchical multi-agent architecture, as well as the methodological control framework. Such a hierarchical multi-agent approach is envisioned to be highly scalable for the control of complex biologically inspired robot locomotion systems.","","978-1-4244-9318-0","10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5723346","Developmental Robotics;Multi-Agent Architectures;Neuro-Dynamic Learning","Mobile robots;Computer architecture;Joints;Robot kinematics;Function approximation;Collaboration","dynamic programming;fuzzy set theory;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems","fuzzy rule based neuro-dynamic programming;mobile robot skill acquisition;nested multiagent architecture;biologically inspired architectures;intelligent robots;self-organization problems;effective learning;skill transfer processes;developmental skill learning process;neuro-dynamic learning mechanism;function approximators;collaborative control scheme;distributed agents;multiagent system;e-Puck robots;collaborative box-pushing task;complex biologically inspired robot locomotion systems","","2","","31","","3 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With OMAS we tried to answer the problems of architecture, skill definition, protocol implementation, ontologies, dialog using natural language, and debugging, in such a way that a naive user can develop an application easily. OMAS uses a plug in type of approach offering a model of generic cognitive agent. Agents are of three types: service, personal assistants and transfer. They are organized as coteries, meaning that each agent sees all messages. Agents have separate ontologies and task models. Agents are multi-threaded and can execute several tasks concurrently. Personal assistants have prototype dialogs and vocal interface. OMAS is particularly well suited for supporting CSCWD projects or applications.

These robotic systems will need to have autonomous capabilities to take over during communication delays and unexpected environmental conditions during critical phases of the procedure. Understanding and predicting the next surgical actions (referred as “surgemes”) is essential for autonomous surgery. Most approaches for surgeme recognition cannot cope with the high variability associated with austere environments and thereby cannot “transfer” well to field robotics. We propose a methodology that uses compact image representations with kinematic features for surgeme recognition in the DESK dataset. This dataset offers samples for surgical procedures over different robotic platforms with a high variability in the setup. We performed surgeme classification in two setups: 1) No transfer, 2) Transfer from a simulated scenario to two real deployable robots. Then, the results were compared with recognition accuracies using only kinematic data with the same experimental setup. The results show that our approach improves the recognition performance over kinematic data across different domains. The proposed approach produced a transfer accuracy gain up to 20% between the simulated and the real robot, and up to 31% between the simulated robot and a different robot.

We present a framework which is able of such knowledge transfer from already learned movement skills to a new learning task. The framework combines probabilistic movement primitives with descriptions of their effects for skill representation. New skills are first initialized with parameters inferred from related movement primitives and thereafter adapted to the new task through relative entropy policy search. We compare two different transfer approaches to initialize the search space distribution with data of known skills with a similar effect. We show the different benefits of the two knowledge transfer approaches on an object pushing task for a simulated 3-DOF robot.

Experiments in driving simulators have shown that shared control reduces control variability and mental workload, and improves accuracy in path tracking and car following. Crucial to road safety, however, is not whether shared control improves performance in routine driving tasks, but what happens in dangerous situations when a conflict of authority occurs, or when the force feedback cannot be relied upon or is suddenly disengaged. Drawing on research into transfer of training, it is shown that shared control may induce aftereffects and may hamper retention of robust driving skills.

The system uses the structure known as ¿hardware in the loop¿ in which the aircraft model is simulated in a PC (Personal Computer) and the designed controller is implemented in a microcontroller. The proposed system is appropriate to be used in laboratory classes in which the students can test the controllers previously designed using control theory and can also practice the use of interfacing devices, necessary to convert the analog signals provided by the sensors to the digital form used by the processors, and communication devices, necessary to the information exchange between the PC and the microcontroller.

Learning a complex dance from a verbal description is difficult, as spoken words are slow and cannot encapsulate all the details of a precise maneuver. Unfortunately, in a museum environment, visitors are not afforded the opportunity to become fully immersed in ancient and endangered forms of dance with a live instructor because having instructions inside the museum is not logistically feasible. Instead prerecorded video or paper-based images and notes are presented for perusal. This neither assists in the communication of the importance of this type of cultural heritage nor preserves the performances by passing on skills to future generations. The lack of knowledge transfer in this domain means each year many indigenous dances and their particular movements are lost in time as they become irrelevant and no longer practiced. This is a disgrace as cultural dance represents an expression, social interaction and sometime spiritual representation of a feeling or even an historical narrative in some cultures. It is an important part in understanding a culture, as much as the tangible that remains so highly soughtout by archeologists, yet dance, like other Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), without human practice, cannot be preserved in the same manner. To address this issue, we propose herein a system using motion-sensing and gaming technology that can assist in the preservation and knowledge transfer of indigenous dances. GLIDE is an application based on motion detecting technology that targets children in a heritage-related environment in order to create awareness about indigenous dance movements. It will offer kinesthetic clarity and playfulness in a domain very much dominated by flat, non-interactive video content.","2166-675X","978-1-4673-1358-2","10.1109/IGIC.2012.6329834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6329834","Heritage;Serious Gaming;Museum Technologie;Augmented Reality;Motion detecting Technologies","Cultural differences;Games;Prototypes;Educational institutions;Knowledge transfer;Humans;Motion segmentation","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;humanities","tangible cultural learning;indigenous dance;motion detecting technology;museum environment;cultural heritage;knowledge transfer;cultural dance;social interaction;intangible cultural heritage;ICH;motion-sensing technology;gaming technology;GLIDE;heritage-related environment","","3","","15","","15 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The constant speed of a standard treadmill encourages automaticity rather than engagement and fails to simulate the variable speeds encountered during real-world walking. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a user-driven treadmill velocity control scheme that allows the user to experience natural fluctuations in walking velocity with minimal unwanted inertial force due to acceleration/deceleration of the treadmill belt. A smart estimation limiter in the scheme effectively attenuates the inertial force during velocity changes. The proposed scheme requires measurement of pelvic and swing foot motions, and is developed for a treadmill of typical belt length (1.5 m). The proposed scheme is quantitatively evaluated here with four healthy subjects by comparing it with the most advanced control scheme identified in the literature.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346610","","Acceleration;Legged locomotion;Force;Belts;Estimation;Foot;Velocity measurement","gait analysis;patient rehabilitation","user-driven treadmill control scheme;overground locomotion simulation;treadmill-based locomotor training;overground walking;optimal skill transfer;user-driven treadmill velocity control scheme;treadmill belt acceleration;treadmill belt deceleration;smart estimation limiter;pelvic motions;swing foot motions;patient rehabilitation","Biomechanical Phenomena;Female;Humans;Locomotion;Male;Walking","5","","14","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are many essential differences between simulated data and data from the real world. Thus, models trained naively on simulated data often fail to generalize to reality. To address that problem, we propose two approaches to transferring robot perception module, which are based on domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), respectively. The former approach tries to extract domain-invariant features by a shared feature extractor and use the domain-invariant features to train a transferrable target localization model (TLM). Meanwhile, the latter approach attempts to learn a transformation from the source domain to the target domain and use the transformation to generate realistic synthetic samples. Then, the synthetic samples are exploited as training data for the TLM. The experiments show that given enough simulated data and only a small amount of real world data, the TLM adapted by our methods could generalize well to real-world environments without drastic performance decline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923541","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737927","Robotic grasping;skill transfer;domain adversarial neural networks (DANN);generative adversarial networks (GAN)","Robots;Feature extraction;Data models;Adaptation models;Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks;Training","intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","adversarial learning;robotic control;simulated environments;deep neural networks;simulated data;domain adversarial neural networks;generative adversarial networks;domain-invariant features;shared feature extractor;transferrable target localization model;TLM;source domain;target domain;training data;robot perception module","","","","35","CCBY","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This allows us to transfer a skill by defining a policy on a prototype model and morphing the observed environment to this prototype. A deep neural network is used to map depth image observations of the environment to morphing parameter, which include transformations and configurations of the prototype model. Using the concatenation property of affine transformations and the ability to convert point clouds to depth images allows to apply the network in an iterative manner. The network is trained on data generated in a simulator and on augmented data that is created with its own predictions.

In a previous work we proposed a hierarchical modular reinforcement learning model (RANK) that can learn multiple motor skills in continuous action and state spaces. The model is based on a development of the mixture-of-expert model that has been suitably developed to work with reinforcement learning. In particular, the model uses a high-level gating network for assigning responsibilities for acting and for learning to a set of low-level expert networks. The model was also developed with the goal of exploiting the Piagetian mechanisms of assimilation and accommodation to support learning of multiple tasks. This paper proposes a new model (TERL - Transfer Expert Reinforcement Learning) that substantially improves RANK. The key difference with respect to the previous model is the decoupling of the mechanisms that generate the responsibility signals of experts for learning and for control. This made possible to satisfy different constraints for functioning and for learning. We test both the TERL and the RANK models with a two-DOFs dynamic arm engaged in solving multiple reaching tasks, and compare the two with a simple, flat reinforcement learning model. The results show that both models are capable of exploiting assimilation and accommodation processes in order to transfer knowledge between similar tasks, and at the same time to avoid catastrophic interference. Furthermore, the TERL model is shown to significantly outperform the RANK model thanks to its faster and more stable specialization of experts.","2161-9476","978-1-4673-4965-9","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400871","","Joints;Learning;Noise;Robot sensing systems;Interference;Face;Neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);robots","reinforcement learning algorithms;skill assimilation;skill accommodation;multiple motor skills;TERL;transfer expert reinforcement learning;2-DOF dynamic arm;knowledge transfer;supervised learning problems;simulated robot","","4","1","25","","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into “task-specific” and “robot-specific” modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training. Using a novel approach to train modular neural networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual and non-visual tasks.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989250","","Neural networks;Robot sensing systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Games;Training;Visualization","dexterous manipulators;directed graphs;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics;manipulator kinematics;multi-robot systems;neural nets;robot vision","modular neural network policy learning;multitask multirobot transfer learning;robotic skills;deep reinforcement learning;general purpose modular neural network policy training;RL;task-specific modules;robot-specific modules;robot dynamics;robot kinematics;mix-and-match modules;zero-shot generalization;visual tasks;nonvisual tasks","","27","","34","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A RR is a bi-directional system capable of understanding the meaning of motions and transferring skills among users and interfaces according to the interpreted motions. In this paper, the reactive robot control was used for replicating Japanese characters and the recognition system was used for evaluating the stochastic user's performance based on the hidden Markov model. This system may help to understand better the learning processes. Using such a kind of system, an application for learning Japanese handwriting has been developed and tested. We evaluated the skill transfer capabilities when the haptic feedback is used to improve the learning process based on some of the RR system features. Findings from this study indicate that the user's performance is enhanced considerably when both visual and haptic information are provided.","","0-7803-8136-X","10.1109/ROMAN.2003.1251841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251841","","Haptic interfaces;Robot kinematics;Feedback;Humans;Force sensors;Education;Performance analysis;Laboratories;Bidirectional control;Robot control","robots;handwriting recognition;hidden Markov models;haptic interfaces;feedback;probability;performance index;character sets","skill transfer system;reactive robots technology;reactive robots system;bidirectional system;user interfaces;reactive robot control;Japanese characters;recognition system;hidden Markov model;haptic feedback;learning process;time probability;force probability;recognition probability;performance index","","9","","18","","19 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Actual walls are generally composed of multiple (thin) layers and may be exposed to solar irradiance. Modeling the wall construction explicitly can be tedious (because of complexities at wall intersections) and also problematic, as the computational grid required in the wall may be much finer than that of the adjacent fluid region. This is an issue particularly in preliminary design applications where a coarse grid is most efficient. The disparity in grid length scale can dramatically increase solution times and negatively impact robustness, resulting in the need for a large overall cell count to achieve low-aspect-ratio cells. To avoid these liabilities, we introduce a compact (steadystate and transient) mathematical model that accounts for solar heat flux and three-dimensional heat transfer, and requires no physical grid cells in the thickness-direction of the wall. We validate the compact wall model's predictions against detailed numerical benchmarks and find that it accurately predicts both temporal and spatial temperature variations. The primary value of the model is that it can be built into applicationspecific CFD tools (e.g., for analyzing modular systems) so that wall heat transfer and thermal mass can be accurately modeled with minimum user effort or modeling skill.","","978-1-5090-2994-5","10.1109/ITHERM.2017.7992483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992483","computational fluid dynamics;conduction model;compact wall model;thermal network;solar load;modular systems;containers","Erbium;Conferences","computational fluid dynamics;flow simulation;heat transfer","compact wall model;CFD simulation;multiple layer;solar irradiance;adjacent fluid region;low-aspect-ratio cells;compact mathematical model;solar heat flux;three-dimensional heat transfer;physical grid cells;wall thickness-direction;numerical benchmarks;spatial temperature variations;temporal temperature variations;thermal mass","","","","14","","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, the generation of the training content to be transferred via AR is a comprehensive problem that is addressed in this paper. Thus, this paper tries to describe the whole chain of implementations and general aspects involved in the creation of AR training applications, including examples for used multimodal devices.

However, the Energy Efficiency (EE) of the whole WPT-DCCN, which combines the time allocation and the power control of all users (including base station, cellular and D2D user), is rarely studied. Consequently, this study establishes an EE optimization model of the whole WPT-DCCN. Facing the complexity of the modeled mathematical model, the EE problem is approximately converted to a convex one by a proposed Convex Approximation Scheme (CAS). Due to the fractional expression of the variables needed to be solved, it is hard to directly obtain an optimal solution for the converted convex problem through current convex optimization toolbox such as CVX. Thus, we skillfully utilize the Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) to obtain an optimal solution for the converted convex problem by analyzing the characteristics of the converted problem. Simulation results show that the proposed CAS can give a tight lower-bound solution of the original EE problem. Furthermore, CAS can help us to investigate some meaningful system features, for example the suitable energy conversion efficiency setting under different WPT-DCCN scenarios, which can give us a clear reference about the deployment of future WPT-DCCN.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960529","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Southwest University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936440","Wireless power transfer;D2D communication;energy efficiency;time allocation;power control;convex approximation scheme","Device-to-device communication;Resource management;Batteries;Wireless communication;Mathematical model;Power control;Optimization","approximation theory;cellular radio;concave programming;convex programming;energy conservation;inductive power transmission;optimisation;power control;resource allocation;telecommunication power supplies","cellular network;wireless power transfer-supported device-to-device communication;wireless power transfer-supported D2D communication;controllable energy resource;reliable energy resource;energy efficient resource allocation;future WPT-DCCN;different WPT-DCCN scenarios;suitable energy conversion efficiency;original EE problem;current convex optimization toolbox;converted convex problem;optimal solution;CAS;convex approximation scheme;modeled mathematical model;EE optimization model;cellular D2D user;base station;power control;time allocation;energy efficiency;spectral efficiency","","","","43","CCBY","18 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first experiment was focused on evaluating the efficiency of three feedback schemes for the target trajectory: visual, haptic and visual-haptic feedback. The second experiment was focused on analyzing the influence of decreasing the feedback during the training process. The results suggest that the best learning condition for learning a 3D trajectory with accuracy is to provide visual-haptic feedback, which facilitates the understanding of the dimension and orientation of each trajectory segment and solves any visual discrepancies that may exist. Furthermore, although continuous feedback can create dependences in users and impede the transfer of motor skills, feedback based on user request can also be dangerous since users can create a wrong mental representation that keep them from replicating the trajectory accurately. Therefore, when the performance of a task depends on references created during the training process, it seems appropriate for the system to provide automatic feedback based on user performance.","","978-1-4244-6509-5","10.1109/HAVE.2010.5623979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623979","virtual training;motor skill transfer;virtual teaching;haptic feedback","Trajectory;Haptic interfaces;Visualization;Training;Three dimensional displays;Accuracy;Shape","haptic interfaces;knowledge representation;training;virtual reality;visual perception","training strategy;3D trajectory;motor skill transfer;visual-haptic feedback;trajectory segment;visual discrepancy;virtual reality","","3","","13","","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The variety and complexity of each of these standards and concepts present a significant barrier to entry into e-business for many small companies. Approximately 20% of European companies buy and sell over the Internet with big companies buying and selling more. The challenge facing the eEurope action plan is to enable the ""small to medium sized enterprises"" (SMEs) to participate in e-business without over extending their resources. Aspiring e-business professionals in these small companies do not have the time or the resources needed to invest in understanding all these concepts and standards. They need to understand the concepts and standards quickly before deciding to invest their time in the area or not. We discuss the development of an e-business skillset enhancement tool (eSET) for B2B integration scenarios through the development of a working model of an e-business environment that can assist the SMEs and advanced 3rd level students in introducing them to the world of B2B. This enables them to experience the B2B environment professionals to see how their enterprise can use e-business and B2B. They can see data in the electronic environment, experience the transfer of data electronically over the Internet, view their processes modeled and simulated. They can see an e-business B2B environment processing their data using their business processes. This enables them to make an informed decision before investment in this area.

The best existing robot planners are based on random sampling of configuration space- which becomes excessively high-dimensional with large number of objects. Consequently, most planners often fail to efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract the decision making, irrespective of the number of obstacles. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of waypoints in task space. These waypoints provided a high-level plan, which could be transferred to an arbitrary robot model and used to initialise a local trajectory optimiser. We evaluated this approach through testing on unseen human VR data, a physics-based robot simulation, and a real robot (dataset and code are publicly available1). We found that the human-like planner outperformed a state-of-the-art standard trajectory optimisation algorithm, and was able to generate effective strategies for rapid planning- irrespective of the number of obstacles in the environment.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196665","","Task analysis;Planning;Robots;Testing;Feature extraction;Trajectory;Standards","collision avoidance;decision making;dexterous manipulators;grippers;learning (artificial intelligence);planning (artificial intelligence);robot programming;robot vision;trajectory control;virtual reality","decision making;decision classifiers;cluttered environments;robot planners;random sampling;object manipulation plans;virtual reality;trajectory optimisation;physics based robot simulation;human-like planning;depth camera;Robotiq two finger gripper","","","","31","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The training is conventionally performed on rubber mannequins albeit practical limitations.

However, the complex interactions between the tube and the nasogastric passage make it difficult to model the haptic feedback during NGT placement. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to directly transfer the experience of clinicians in NGT placement into the simulation system. Based on their perception of the varying tactile sensation and the conditions during NGT placement, the membership functions and fuzzy rules are defined to develop the force model. Forces created using the model are then combined with friction forces to drive the haptic device and render the insertion forces in real time. A prototype simulator is developed based on the proposed force model and the implementation details are presented. The usability of the prototype is also evaluated by clinical teachers. The proposed methodology has the potential for developing computerized NGT placement training methods for clinical education.

To address these, learning policies in simulation and then transferring them to physical systems has been proposed. In this letter, we propose a novel sample-efficient transfer approach, which is agnostic to the dynamics of a simulated system and combines it with incremental learning. Instead of transferring a single control policy, we transfer a generalizable contextual policy generated in simulation using one or few samples from real world to a target global model, which can generate policies across parameterized real-world situations. We studied the generalization capability of the incremental transfer framework using MuJoCo physics engine and KUKA LBR 4+. Experiments with ball-in-a-cup and basketball tasks demonstrated that the target model improved the generalization capability beyond the direct use of the source model indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experiments also indicated that the transfer capability depends on the generalization capability of the corresponding source model, similarity between source and target environment, and number of samples used for transferring.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2900768","Academy of Finland, decision; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648230","Learning and Adaptive Systems;Model Learning for Control","Task analysis;Adaptation models;Context modeling;Databases;Uncertainty;Robots;Friction","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;robot dynamics;robots;rolling friction","target global model;policies;generalization capability;incremental transfer framework;MuJoCo physics engine;KUKA LBR 4;target model;transfer capability;target environment;reinforcement learning;robots;autonomous learning framework;skill;wear;physical systems;simulated system;incremental learning;single control policy;generalizable contextual policy;source model;sample-efficient transfer approach;generalizable motor primitives","","4","","21","CCBY","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

What the student can learn is the teacher's horizontal brush position trajectory, his normal pushing force against a virtual paper, and the distance between the teacher's brush and the virtual paper. Recognizing that it is impossible to display both the normal force information and the normal position information at the same time, we have implemented two methods of skill display: one is to use the haptic display device for displaying the position information, and the other is to use it for displaying the force information. The remaining information is displayed using a secondary display device, visual display in the developed system.

Rather than presuming that patients could generalize in three conditions, this study tested whether there was any evidence of such generalization ability in healthy individuals. We found that there was some evidence in all conditions except for the ability of healthy subjects to generalize to large movements after practicing small.

Fostering observational skills to enable accurate risk area identification is a requirement from the stage of basic education for the provision of safe medical care to patients. In the present study, we devised and implemented experimental learning aimed at first-year nursing students that incorporated medical accident reenactments and simulations using simulated patients.

Many tasks, such as use of hand tools, involve significant interaction forces between hand and environment. One control strategy would be to use high hand impedance to reduce sensitivity to these forces. But an alternative would be to learn feedback compensation for the extrinsic dynamics and associated interaction forces, with the potential for lower control effort. We observed subjects as they learned control of a ball-and-beam system, a visuo-motor task where the goal was to quickly position a ball rolling atop a rotating beam, through manual rotation of the beam alone. We devised a ball-and-beam apparatus that could be operated in a real mode, where a physical ball was present; or in a virtual training mode, where the ball's dynamics were simulated in real time. The apparatus presented the same visual feedback in all cases, and optionally produced haptic feedback of the interaction forces associated with the ball's motion. Two healthy adult subject groups, vision-only and vision-haptics (each n=10), both trained for 80 trials on the simulated system, and then were evaluated on the real system to test for skill transfer effects. If humans incorporate interaction forces in their learning, the vision-haptics group would be expected to exhibit a smoother transfer, as quantified by changes in completion time of a ball-positioning task. During training, both groups adapted well to the task, with reductions of 64%-70% in completion time. At skill transfer to the real system, the vision-only group had a significant 35% increase in completion time (p<0.05). There was no significant change in the vision-haptics group, indicating that subjects had learned to compensate for interaction forces. These forces could potentially be incorporated in virtual environments to assist with motor training or rehabilitation","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2006.881533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703571","Feedback control;haptic interface;motor adaptation;motor control;object manipulation;upper extremity","Humans;Force feedback;Haptic interfaces;Neurofeedback;Muscles;Force control;Virtual environment;Sensor arrays;Testing;Impedance","biomechanics;feedback;haptic interfaces;medical control systems;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality;vision","human adaptation;interaction forces;visuo-motor coordination;contact tasks;hand tools;high hand impedance;feedback compensation;ball-and-beam system;visual feedback;haptic feedback;ball-positioning task;motor training;rehabilitation","Adaptation, Physiological;Feedback;Humans;Motor Skills;Movement;Muscle, Skeletal;Musculoskeletal Equilibrium;Stress, Mechanical;Task Performance and Analysis;Touch;Upper Extremity;Visual Perception","15","","20","","18 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We simulate the effects of genetic influences via variations in the neuro-computational parameters of the ANNs, and the effects of environmental influences via a filter applied to the training set. Our approach uses the twin method to disentangle genetic and environmental influences on performance, capturing transfer effects via changes to the heritability measure. Our model captures the wide range of variability exhibited by population members as they are trained on five different tasks. Preliminary experiments produced encouraging results as to the utility of this method.

As a remedy for the limitation, this paper investigates a novel treadmill control scheme that allows users to change walking speed freely. It further simulates natural walking by reducing anomalous force (AF) due to acceleration of the treadmill belt. Adding an attenuator in the scheme effectively diminishes the AF when changing walking speed. The proposed scheme, which requires real-time measurement of pelvic and swing foot motion, was developed for a treadmill with a typical belt length (1.5m). A clinical test was conducted with nine healthy subjects in order to quantitatively evaluate the proposed scheme by comparing it with the two existing control schemes in the literature.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2014.2341039","National Institutes of Health; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881690","Anomalous force (AF);locomotor training;rehabilitation;simulating overground walking (OW);treadmill control;Anomalous force (AF);locomotor training;rehabilitation;simulating overground walking (OW);treadmill control","Legged locomotion;Acceleration;Belts;Foot;Force;Attenuators;Observers","force control;medical control systems;motion control;patient rehabilitation","interactive treadmill;control scheme;overground walking simulation;anomalous force reduction;treadmill-based locomotor training;OW simulation;overground walking;treadmill control scheme;treadmill belt acceleration;attenuator;pelvic motion;swing foot motion","","14","","21","","21 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Learning algorithms instead have the potential to lighten up this challenge by using one single set of training parameters for learning different skills, but the question of the feasibility of such learning in real robots remains a research pursuit. We focus on a kind of mobile robot system - the robot soccer “small-size” domain, in which tactical and high-level team strategies build upon individual robot ball-based skills. In this paper, we present our work using a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn three real robot primitive skills in continuous action space: go-to-ball, turn-and-shoot and shoot-goalie, for which there is a clear success metric to reach a destination or score a goal. We introduce the state and action representation, as well as the reward and network architecture. We describe our training and testing using a simulator of high physical and hardware fidelity. Then we test the policies trained from simulation on real robots. Our results show that the learned skills achieve an overall better success rate at the expense of taking 0.29 seconds slower on average for all three skills. In the end, we show that our policies trained in simulation have good performance on real robots by directly transferring the policy.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8793688","","Robot kinematics;Sports;Task analysis;Training;Legged locomotion","intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);legged locomotion;multi-robot systems;robot vision","robot soccer small-size domain;tactical level team strategies;high-level team strategies;individual robot ball-based skills;robot primitive skills;continuous action space;hardware fidelity;learned skills;mobile robots;hand-coding algorithms;training parameters;mobile robot system;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;primitive skills;task performance;learning algorithms","","","","28","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, these pre-trained DRL models cannot generalize well to un-trained tasks. To overcome these problems above, in this paper, we propose a Memory-based Parameterized Skills Learning (MPSL) model for mapless visual navigation. The parameterized skills in our MPSL are learned to predict critic parameters for un-trained tasks in actor-critic reinforcement learning, which can be achieved by transferring memory sequence knowledge from long short term memory network. In order to generalize into un-trained tasks, MPSL aims to capture more discriminative features by using a scene-specific layer.

But due to a communication delay and insufficient information about the remote workplace, it is difficult to perform some tasks in tele-operation. In order to solve these problems, graphics techniques in tele-operation have been studied. As the network technology has progressed, the dedicated communication lines of tele-operation have been replaced with the public communication networks such as the Internet. Experiments using the World Wide Web for tele-operation have been studied. In this paper, a graphic simulator is proposed and developed, which can be used to monitor robots in a remote workplace by using on-line simulation. In particular, it supports a network client/server model for tele-operations of robots. In the system, the sensor information are collected continuously and the event messages are generated according to each tele-operation. The generated event messages are transferred to the graphic workstation through the network by using the TCP/IP messaging and utilized to visualize the tele-operation. The dedicated communication protocols to transmit the information efficiently are developed. In order to do this, we classified several tele-operations and the developed protocols are used to transfer the event messages to the graphic workstation.","","0-7803-7090-2","10.1109/ISIE.2001.931781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931781","","Graphics;Employment;Robot sensing systems;Workstations;Protocols;Delay;Communication networks;IP networks;Web sites;Remote monitoring","telerobotics;Internet;computer graphics;client-server systems;digital simulation;transport protocols;industrial robots;nuclear fuel cycle facilities;discrete event simulation","spent nuclear fuel management system;robot graphic simulator;tele-operation;remote workplace information;communication delay;graphics techniques;network technology;World Wide Web;Internet;robots monitoring;on-line simulation;network client/server model;sensor information;event messages;graphic workstation;TCP/IP messaging;dedicated communication protocols;information transmission","","2","","10","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to exploration and hierarchical skill learning that derives its sample efficiency from intuitive assumptions it makes about the behavior of objects both in the physical world and simulations which mimic physics. Specifically, we propose the Hypothesis Proposal and Evaluation (HyPE) algorithm, which discovers objects from raw pixel data, generates hypotheses about the controllability of observed changes in object state, and learns a hierarchy of skills to test these hypotheses. We demonstrate that HyPE can dramatically improve the sample efficiency of policy learning in two different domains: a simulated robotic blockpushing domain, and a popular benchmark task: Breakout. In these domains, HyPE learns high-scoring policies an order of magnitude faster than several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9340891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340891","","Transfer learning;Reinforcement learning;Proposals;Task analysis;Standards;Physics;Intelligent robots","","","","","","53","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We find that transfer learning employed in this context leads to a significant acceleration of learning. A refinement of the basic transfer learning strategy that is motivated from the principle of scaffolding in psychology leads to further improvements, totalling to an overall speed-up factor of almost one order of magnitude for a reinforcement learner solving an “extension-of-reach” task in a 2D world with simulated physics.","2164-0580","978-1-5386-7283-9","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2018.8624951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624951","","Task analysis;Reinforcement learning;Tools;Biological neural networks;Acceleration;Humanoid robots","learning (artificial intelligence);psychology","mediated interaction learning;deep reinforcement learning;suitable mediator object;unmediated interaction;basic transfer learning strategy;extension-of-reach task;psychology","","","","23","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A two-staged segmentation algorithm that employs skill template matching via Hidden Markov Models has been developed to extract motion primitives from the demonstration and gives them semantic meanings. In this way, the transfer of task knowledge has been improved from a simple replay of the demonstration towards a semantically annotated, optimized and generalized execution.

The present study compares the ability of practicing veterinarians and veterinary students to identify the stiffness of virtual surfaces through palpation. An absolute identification paradigm was used where a force-feedback haptic device rendered virtual surfaces with five levels of stiffness within a “clinically relevant” range (0.2-0.5 N/mm). The mean information transfer was 0.97 bits (almost two perfectly identifiable stiffness levels) for 12 veterinarians and 0.58 bits (one correctly identified level) for 14 veterinary students. Although the difference between the two groups was significant (p <; 0.001), neither group was able to reliably identify more than two levels of stiffness, indicating that the success of veterinarians in clinical practice probably relies on additional properties such as size, shape, and texture. Analyses of force versus time and displacement versus time recordings suggest that the superior performance of the veterinarians may be partially attributable to motor strategy. Specifically, veterinarians used a greater mean maximum force (2.0 N) compared to students (1.6 N) (p <; 0.05). However, further studies are required to investigate motor strategy in more detail. The implications of our findings for veterinary education and quantitative skill assessment are discussed.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669308","Stiffness perception;stiffness identification;comparison of users;veterinary medicine;education;training.","Haptic interfaces;Force;Training;Measurement;Phantoms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Testing","biomedical education;computer based training;force feedback;haptic interfaces;rendering (computer graphics);statistical analysis;veterinary medicine;virtual reality","haptic stiffness identification;veterinarian;palpation;clinical skill;veterinary profession;medical health profession;veterinary student;identification paradigm;force-feedback haptic device;virtual surface rendering;mean information transfer;clinical practice;motor strategy;mean maximum force;veterinary education;quantitative skill assessment;veterinary medicine;training","","12","","34","","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a simple versus a complex VE on motor learning of a novel balance task in typically developing (TD) children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). In addition, we explored the relationship between children's motivation, engagement and their motor learning outcomes in each VE. Twenty-seven TD children and 6 children with hemiplegic or diplegic CP participated. Participants were randomized to practice the same novel postural control task in either a simple or a complex flat-screen display VE. Motor learning was measured by an error metric per trial. Following 40 acquisition trials, children completed motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and engagement (User Engagement Scale) measures. They returned 2-7 days later for retention and transfer tests. Children with CP had significantly greater performance errors as compared to TD children at all sessions; however, there was no difference in performance between simple and complex VE conditions at any session, nor were there any differences in engagement or motivation between conditions or groups. Lower self-reported motivation was associated with greater performance error at retention and transfer in all participants.

The virtual environment is low-cost, easily configured, and offers a wealth of data for post-hoc analysis compared with real physical prostheses and robots. For use with prosthetics and research involving amputee subjects it allows the valuable time with the subject to be spent in experiments rather than fixing hardware issues. The usefulness of the virtual environment increases as the realism of the environment increases. Most tasks performed with limbs require interactions with objects in the environment. To simulate these tasks the dynamics of frictional contact, in addition to inertial limb dynamics must be modeled. Here, subjects demonstrate real-time control of an eight degree-of-freedom virtual prosthesis while performing an interactive box-and-blocks task. With practice, four nonamputee subjects and one shoulder disarticulation subject were able to successfully transfer blocks in the virtual environment at an average rate of just under two blocks per minute. The virtual environment is configurable in terms of the virtual arm design, control strategy, and task.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2274599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587127","Myoelectric control;neural machine interface;prosthesis;targeted muscle reinnervation;virtual system","Prosthetics;Wrist;Joints;Virtual environments;Shoulder;Electromyography;Dynamics","biomechanics;brain-computer interfaces;electromyography;friction;mechanical variables control;medical control systems;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;prosthetics;virtual reality","real-time control;interactive impulsive virtual prosthesis;interactive virtual dynamic environment;control strategy testing;neural machine interfacing;artificial limbs;post-hoc analysis;real physical prostheses;robots;amputee subjects;fixing hardware issues;frictional contact;inertial limb dynamics;degree-of-freedom virtual prosthesis;interactive box-and-blocks task;shoulder disarticulation subject;nonamputee subjects;virtual arm design;control strategy","Algorithms;Amputation;Artificial Limbs;Biomechanical Phenomena;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Computer Simulation;Disarticulation;Electromyography;Fingers;Hand;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Motor Skills;Movement;Prostheses and Implants;Prosthesis Design;Shoulder;Torque;Ulna;User-Computer Interface;Wrist","5","","33","","26 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We analyzed the network traffic patterns and bandwidth consumption to better understand how such games impact the network. Both games were found to have very low bandwidth usage and packets significantly smaller than typical Internet applications. Starcraft games showed consistent traffic behavior across games while the traffic patterns for Counter-strike varied widely, especially for the server. In particular, Counter-strike clients and servers often send bursts of very small packets.

One proposed mechanism is via enhanced user engagement and/or motivation, which may directly influence the quality of motor memory consolidation. The objectives of this study were to a) compare children's motor learning of the same novel postural reaching task in a VE versus a PE; b) evaluate differences in engagement and motivation between the two practice environments; and c) explore the relationships between practice environment, engagement, motivation, and motor learning. Thirty-six typically developing children aged 7-13 years were randomized to acquire a novel postural reaching skill in either a 2D flat-screen VE or a PE. Skin conductance level (SCL) was measured on the non-task hand during practice. Following acquisition, children completed a language-modified User Engagement Scale (UES) and the Pediatric Motivation Inventory (PMOT). Participants returned 1-7 days later for retention (same environment) and transfer (opposite environment) tests. Children who practiced in the VE demonstrated greater retention, as evidenced by higher mean scores on the retention test (t[30] = -3.72, p = 0.001, partial eta squared 0.28). Children who practiced in the PE demonstrated greater transfer to the opposite environment as compared to those who practiced in the VE (t[30] = 2.05, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.238). There were no significant differences in UES total or subscale scores between the 2 groups. PMOT total motivation scores differed significantly between groups, favoring the VE (t[30]= 2.49, p = 0.018, partial eta squared = 0.154). There were no significant differences in SCL peak count or peaks per minute between groups. There was no relationship between engagement, motivation, and retention or transfer performance. Findings suggest that retention but not transfer of a new motor skill may be facilitated by practice in a VE. This may be due to unique task demands in each environment. Children were more motivated to succeed in the VE and were engaged in the task in both environments, suggesting that both constructs should be measured in subsequent studies and that VE aesthetics alone may not be a key `active ingredient' of children's engagement. Subsequent research will more objectively quantify neurophysiological correlates of engagement and motivation, explore additional tasks, include populations with neurological impairments and compare 3D vs 2D VE displays.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007489","Virtual reality;video game;motor learning;engagement;motivation;children","Games;Pediatrics;Virtual environments;Medical treatment;Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays","computer games;medical computing;neurophysiology;paediatrics;skin;virtual reality","children motor learning;postural reaching task;virtual environment;pediatric rehabilitation;motor learning;physical environment;user engagement;motor memory consolidation;practice environment;skin conductance level;nontask hand;language-modified user engagement scale;pediatric motivation inventory;PMOT;UES;SCL;retention test;neurophysiological correlates;motivation impairments;3D VE displays;2D VE displays","","","","18","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advantage over traditional methods is the integration of high-level planner and feedback control all in one single coherent policy network, which is generic for learning versatile balancing and recovery motions against unknown perturbations at arbitrary locations (e.g., legs, torso). Furthermore, the proposed framework allows the policy to be learned quickly by many state-of-the-art learning algorithms.

This model has achieved reliable performance in areas such as human-robot collaboration and dual-arm manipulation. However, the crucial task frames and associated parameters in this learning framework are often set by the human teacher, which renders three problems that have not been addressed yet: (i) task frames are treated equally, without considering their individual importance, (ii) task parameters are defined without taking into account additional task constraints, such as robot joint limits and motion smoothness, and (iii) a fixed number of task frames are pre-defined regardless of whether some of them may be redundant or even irrelevant for the task at hand. In this paper, we generalize the task-parameterized learning by addressing the aforementioned problems.

Recent learning methods can operate directly on visual inputs but typically require many demonstrations and/or task-specific reward engineering. In this work we aim to overcome previous limitations and propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to task planning that learns to combine primitive skills. First, compared to previous learning methods, our approach requires neither intermediate rewards nor complete task demonstrations during training. Second, we demonstrate the versatility of our vision-based task planning in challenging settings with temporary occlusions and dynamic scene changes. Third, we propose an efficient training of basic skills from few synthetic demonstrations by exploring recent CNN architectures and data augmentation.

In this work, a hybrid framework combining Programming by Demonstration (PbD) and reinforcement learning is proposed to solve this problem. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and linear regression are used to learn the inverse kinematic model of the manipulator from human demonstrations. The learned model is used as nominal model to calculate the output end-effector trajectories of the manipulator. Two surgical tasks are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning: tube insertion and circle following. Gaussian noise is introduced to the standard model and the disturbed models are fed to the manipulator to calculate the actuator input with respect to the task specific end-effector trajectories. An expectation maximization (E-M) based reinforcement learning algorithm is used to update the disturbed model with returns from rollouts. Simulation results have verified that the disturbed model can be converged to the standard one and the tracking accuracy is enhanced.","","978-1-4673-7782-9","10.1109/ICACI.2016.7449855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449855","surgical robot;programming by demonstration;reinforcement learning;inverse kinematics;policy search","Manipulators;Kinematics;Mathematical model;Learning (artificial intelligence);Hidden Markov models;Aerospace electronics;Standards","actuators;automatic programming;end effectors;expectation-maximisation algorithm;Gaussian noise;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator kinematics;medical computing;medical robotics;mixture models;motion control;regression analysis;surgery","nominal model;output end-effector trajectories;tube insertion;circle following;Gaussian noise;standard model;disturbed models;actuator input;expectation maximization based reinforcement learning algorithm;E-M based reinforcement learning algorithm;human demonstrations;manipulator inverse kinematic model;linear regression;GMR;Gaussian mixture regression;GMM;Gaussian mixture models;PbD;hybrid framework;motion control;model uncertainties;nonlinearities;key-hole like incisions;minimally invasive surgical tasks;tendon-driven serpentine manipulators;flexible manipulators;programming by demonstration;flexible surgical robots;skills transferring","","15","","30","","9 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patients with stroke typically suffer dysfunctions that impair the complex set of motions involved in walking. The limited amount of therapy and resources offered by the current health care system do not provide the frequency and intensity of training needed for functional recovery of the walking skills in patients following stroke assaults. This non-traditional intervention research technique therefore sought to develop an alternative method capable of providing the frequency and intensity needed for improving the walking skills in post-acute stroke patients. The work also attempted to show how skills gained in virtual environments transfer to the real world. The work employed the case study method to report the results observed from four post-acute stroke patients who trained on the non-traditional intervention program for about half an hour per day, five days a week, for a period of four consecutive weeks at the out-patient department of the Sir John Golding Rehabilitation Center. The patients performed a computer-based painting exercise with their hemiplegic legs using a head-mounted display, and their gait variables were recorded and analyzed to determine the usefulness of the program in ambulatory training for post-acute stroke patients. A follow up examination conducted one week after the intervention sought to determine whether the patients could perform the skills learned on the computer-based intervention program in the real world. The results of the research showed that all the patients improved on their gait parameters and could walk better. An observational gait analysis conducted one week post-intervention showed that the skills gained in the virtual environment transferred to real-world conditions. The study contributes to the current effort to provide wider access to therapeutic intervention techniques using computer technology.","1558-058X","1-4244-1028-2","10.1109/SECON.2007.342927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147457","","Physics computing;Medical treatment;Legged locomotion;Frequency;Virtual environment;Computer displays;Medical services;Painting;Leg;Performance analysis","gait analysis;health care;patient treatment;virtual instrumentation","computer-based physical therapy;post-acute stroke patients;ambulatory training;current health care system;virtual environments transfer;Sir John Golding Rehabilitation Center;computer-based painting exercise;hemiplegic legs;head-mounted display;gait analysis;real-world conditions;therapeutic intervention techniques","","","","29","","23 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper decomposes 3D object manipulation into the component movements, taking into account both physical constraints and mechanics. We fabricate five physical devices that simulate these movements in a measurable way under experimental conditions. We then implement the devices in an immersive environment and conduct an experiment to evaluate direct finger-based against ray-based object manipulation.

We hypothesize that training reaching movements in a force field with both hands at the same time, in the same position (bimanual grip) are more beneficial in promoting transfer of the learned skill to the dominant hand than training the unimpaired limb on the same movements in the same force field since the representation of the movement should be invariant of the limb. However, unlike intermanual transfer, bimanual transfer has the potential to involve infinite number of actuator combinations, or joint configurations, interfering with consistent transfer. The efficacy of this method of transfer has implications for people with hemiparesis since the less-affected arm could potentially ""instruct"" the more-affected arm how to move. Here, we report on an experiment that evaluates and compares the skill transfer between limbs in a reaching task: 1) intermanual transfer (from the nondominant to the dominant hand) and 2) bimanual transfer (from a bimanual grip to the dominant hand) with healthy subjects. We used two methods from which to judge the transfer: performance in the presence of the force field or by errors made during ""catch trials"" when the forces were unexpectedly removed as subjects changed hands (known as after effects of adaptation). We found only a small amount of transfer (20% of that seen in the practiced limb) with both types of training, and surprisingly there was no significant difference in the movement accuracy between these two training methods. Moreover, the direction of the after effects supports the assertion that the nervous system generalizes these movements in an extrinsic coordinate system. Accordingly, the limb must experience the dynamics singularly in order to develop an internal model.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4303098","Adaptation;force field;human motor control;internal model","Nervous system;Actuators;Humans;Motor drives;Heart;Research and development;Laboratories;Brain injuries;Neuroplasticity;Couplings","biomechanics","joint configuration;actuator combination;bimanual grip;reaching movements;intermanual transfer;contralateral bimanual limb training;single limb performance","Adaptation, Physiological;Computer Simulation;Functional Laterality;Hand Strength;Humans;Learning;Models, Biological;Motor Skills;Movement;Task Performance and Analysis;Upper Extremity","21","","34","","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They provide atmospheric profiles that are necessary for radiative transfer simulation against observation. However, there are biases and uncertainties in the reanalysis due to NWP model mechanism, parameterization, boundary conditions, and assimilation skills. As spaceborne radiometer data have been used in deriving reanalyses, reanalyses are not independent of these radiometers and should be used with caution when used as reference for radiometer calibration. In addition, these data often have coarse spatial (~100 km horizontally) and temporal resolution (~6 h). An independent data set with high resolution can be very useful to diagnose reanalyses and might improve calibration. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core observatory measures atmospheric water signatures with an onboard radar and radiometer. A GPM data set including atmospheric water vapor, cloud liquid water, and precipitation has been produced based on observational retrieval with high spatiotemporal resolution (~5 km horizontally and 250 m vertically). We have developed a scheme to ingest the high-resolution GPM profiles and perform rigorous simulation and calibration taking into account the radiometer spectral response function, footprint size variation, and antenna pattern. GPM data exhibit different water vapor profiles and weighting functions from reanalyses. It produces overall consistent results of calibration as reanalyses and outperforms them in some aspects.

By focusing on this last form, we study the problem of extracting the reward function explaining the demonstrations from a set of candidate reward functions, and using this information for self-refinement of the skill. This definition of the problem has links with inverse reinforcement learning problems in which the robot autonomously extracts an optimal reward function that defines the goal of the task. By relying on Gaussian mixture models, the proposed approach learns how the different candidate reward functions are combined, and in which contexts or phases of the task they are relevant for explaining the user's demonstrations. The extracted reward profile is then exploited to improve the skill with a self-refinement approach based on expectation-maximization, allowing the imitator to reach a skill level that goes beyond the demonstrations. The approach can be used to reproduce a skill in different ways or to transfer tasks across robots of different structures. The proposed approach is tested in simulation with a new type of continuum robot (STIFF-FLOP), using kinesthetic demonstrations from a Barrett WAM manipulator.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-6358-7","10.1109/IROS.2013.6696585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6696585","","Trajectory;Context;Kinematics;Vectors;Learning (artificial intelligence);Manipulators","expectation-maximisation algorithm;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;robot programming","skills transfer;dissimilar robot;context-dependent rewards;robot programming;reward function;inverse reinforcement learning;Gaussian mixture model;self-refinement approach;expectation-maximization;continuum robot;STIFF-FLOP;kinesthetic demonstration;Barrett WAM manipulator","","6","","19","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an approach to determine whether human subjects control specific contact states. Subjects used a six degree-of-freedom haptic interface to place a box on a plane, and insert L- and S-shaped objects into corresponding holes, while using either their (undetermined) natural strategies or explicitly controlling a pre-specified sequence of contact states. We found that the vast majority of contact states were visited for time periods of less than 40ms, which negates the possibility of human feedback control due to physiological delay limits. Next, using force, moment and velocity trajectories around contact state transitions as a metric, we found that certain states were readily discriminable across natural and explicit control strategies (~ 85%), which indicates that they were not controlled during natural motions. Less discriminable states, in contrast, were likely to have been controlled in both natural and explicit strategies. Our results suggest that humans explicitly control a small subset of contact states, and that their control strategies are reflected in local force and velocity profiles. We thus demonstrate that six degree-of-freedom haptic simulations are effective for characterizing human contact-state invariant control strategies.","2324-7355","978-1-4799-3131-6","10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775438","Perception and psychophysics;haptic;Force rendering;Virtual environment modeling;Manufacturing/assembly","Haptic interfaces;Robots;Force;Trajectory;Educational institutions;Dynamics;Rendering (computer graphics)","control engineering computing;feedback;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;physiology","human contact control strategies;six degree-of-freedom tasks;human contact-manipulation skills;robots;object complexity;environment complexity;L-shaped objects;S-shaped objects;human feedback control;physiological delay limits;haptic simulations;contact-state invariant control strategies","","4","","15","","20 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a first approach to the IAS the authors have been developing a skill acquisition and transfer system using a sensor glove for force feedback to the human operator. The dynamic behavior of the grip transformation matrix is regarded as the essence of the performed manipulation skill shown with a simple manipulation example. A detailed analysis of force transformations between hand and object space yields a method for acquisition of the grip transform dynamic behavior accumulated in the skill database.

Background: While the community has made great advances in conducting engineering education studies, achieving goals of meaningful learning is still difficult. In this context, each new teaching methodology should be field tested, which can be time consuming. Introducing a simulation that can pre-test methodologies to check their efficiency can assist in the methodological building process. Research questions: The proposed simulation environment helps in understanding the differences in the learning rate of a group of agents (students) with different levels of humanization and instruction. Methodology: Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) was used to build the causal relationship between the students and a PBL methodology, to generate the input data for the simulation. Based on the analysis of the responses to a survey performed over five consecutive semesters, it was possible to generate some cause-effect data parameters to be used as the input for a hybrid type of ABS, known as PLS agent. Findings: The use of the proposed model, based on a computational approach, to study the educational process was validated; the simulation outcomes indicate that higher levels of self-esteem, self-realization, and cooperation result in better learning experiences.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2017.2754987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068227","Cooperative learning;electrical engineering;knowledge transfer;simulation;statistics;structural equation modeling","Mathematical model;Analytical models;Data models;Knowledge engineering;Computational modeling;Engineering education","computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering education;teaching","human aspects;PBL classroom model;ABS;soft-skills;students;engineering education studies;meaningful learning;teaching methodology;pre-test methodologies;simulation environment;learning rate;humanization;instruction;cause-effect data parameters;PLS agent;field test;partial least squares path modeling;agent-based simulation;learning dissemination;project-based learning context;PLS-PM;self-esteem;self-realization;cooperation result","","1","","46","","16 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, universities have the power to improve the study skills of pupils at an early stage through the designed programs and measures. With the Pupils' Academy Serious Gaming, the Department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has introduced an instrument to promote the study skills. This initiative aimed primarily at pupils of upper vocational schools (UVS). In addition to the study skills, thus the ability of more application-oriented knowledge transfer objectives and playful introduction to an important enterprise software can be achieved. This paper presents the Pupils' Academy based on the online SAP ERP Simulation Game ERPsim as an example of how the enterprise software SAP ERP is successfully applied to strengthen study skills. In addition, the pupils learn how to deal with the SAP platform and train skills like decision making, analysis, strategy development, data processing and presentation. The positive impact on study skills is evidenced with the help of a self-assessment by means of an IT-based survey carried out by the participating students.

Traditionally, control skill analysis focuses on how to design a state-action map to provide appropriate actions according to the states. Therefore approaches such as dynamic programming and neural networks are employed to compute the appropriate actions for all the states. However, this results in time consuming computation, low robustness and no human control characteristics. Although human control skill is robust, it is subcognitive and difficult to be described by the human operators themselves. In this case, human control trajectory is proposed to record and analyze human control skill. Human control trajectory is just a sequence of the systempsilas states and corresponding human operatorpsilas control actions, sampled at a certain frequency. Taking the advantages of human control trajectories and computation, a new approach is proposed. That is analyzing the human operatorspsila control trajectories to find out the most important states which limit the control effect. And then compute the selected states to set up the local state-action map. After that, based on the computational results and the human control trajectories, synthesize the global state-action map to realize the control skill transformation process. In this paper, a dynamic simulator is used as an example to evaluate the effect of the proposed approach. The results show that this approach can reduce the total computational cost while improve the human operatorpsilas control skill effectively.","2161-816X","978-1-4244-2502-0","10.1109/ICAL.2008.4636260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636260","Machine Learning;Human Control Skill;Human Control Trajectory;State-Action Map;Dynamic Simulator","Humans;Trajectory;Robots;Computational modeling;Arrays;Process control;Robustness","control system analysis;dynamic programming;intelligent robots","state-action map;human control trajectories;human control computation;intelligent robot;cooperative environment;control skill analysis;dynamic programming;neural networks;control skill transformation;dynamic simulator","","1","","19","","30 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

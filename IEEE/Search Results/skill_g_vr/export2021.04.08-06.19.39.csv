On the other hand, during the surgical procedure the patient requires safety, minimally invasive incisions, shorter hospital stay and effective recovery. Therefore, a research study was conducted from 2016 to 2019 at Universitat Internacional Valenciana, in order to suggest the design of a futurist tele-operated Surgical Robotic System prototype, combining the efficiency of the robots used in microsurgery with the synchronized accuracy of the technology used in aerospace medicine, considered the first of its kind in Latin America. For applications on The Earth, the main objective of this project is to show an alternative to provide mechatronic support in advanced laparoscopic surgical procedures applied for General and Gastrointestinal Surgery. The proposed Medical Robotic Device called ""Space Biosurgeon"" has 4 robotic arms with 8 degrees of freedom (DOF) that allow performing semi-automated tasks controlled by the surgeon while a robotic axis slides vertically through anatomical planes of the patient. In the design process, the International Standard IEC 80601-2-77 was applied using SolidWorks for computer-aided design and Matlab for simulation, taking into account patient safety, quality and effectiveness for innovation in surgical incision approach and Single Port Surgery. In addition, a Clinical Engineering analysis is developed, showing the interaction between the 4 important factors in the operating room, which are the physician/surgeon, the patient, the robot and the hospital environment. In conclusion, the application for Aerospace Medicine is the early detection of gastrointestinal diseases by coupling an ultrasound transducer. Furthermore, is planned to integrate sensors for vital signs monitoring, and the first small-scale prototype will be implemented in 2022.","","978-1-7281-9365-6","10.1109/ANDESCON50619.2020.9272122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272122","Surgical Robotic System;General and Gastrointestinal Surgery;Medical Robotic Device;Space Biosurgeon;Surgical Incision Approach;Single Port Surgery;Aerospace Medicine;Ultrasound Transducer","Robots;Surgery;Manipulators;Robot kinematics;Instruments;Space vehicles;Robot sensing systems","aerospace biophysics;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;diseases;medical robotics;surgery;ultrasonic transducers","robotic axis slides;ultrasound transducer;gastrointestinal diseases;clinical engineering analysis;Matlab;medical robotic device;robotic arms;laparoscopic surgical procedures;surgical robotic system;hand-eye coordination;Single Port Surgery","","","","68","","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our algorithmic architecture uses the procedures to autonomously discover how to combine simple skills to achieve complex goals.

In practice, the surgeon relies on depth-estimation skills to localize the tool-tip with respect to the retina in order to perform the tool-navigation task, which can be prone to human error. To alleviate such uncertainty, prior work has introduced ways to assist the surgeon by estimating the tooltip distance to the retina and providing haptic or auditory feedback. However, automating the tool-navigation task itself remains unsolved and largely unexplored. Such a capability, if reliably automated, could serve as a building block to streamline complex procedures and reduce the chance for tissue damage. Towards this end, we propose to automate the tool-navigation task by learning to mimic expert demonstrations of the task. Specifically, a deep network is trained to imitate expert trajectories toward various locations on the retina based on recorded visual servoing to a given goal specified by the user. The proposed autonomous navigation system is evaluated in simulation and in physical experiments using a silicone eye phantom. We show that the network can reliably navigate a needle surgical tool to various desired locations within 137 μm accuracy in physical experiments and 94 μm in simulation on average, and generalizes well to unseen situations such as in the presence of auxiliary surgical tools, variable eye backgrounds, and brightness conditions.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196537","","Tools;Retina;Surgery;Navigation;Task analysis;Trajectory;Robots","end effectors;eye;learning by example;medical robotics;navigation;position control;robot programming;surgery;visual servoing","retinal surgery;auditory feedback;autonomous navigation system;needle surgical tool navigation;learning from demonstration;haptic feedback;deep network training;visual servoing;steady hand eye robot;SHER surgical robot;end effector","","","","26","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current approach to postmarketing surveillance primarily relies on spontaneous reporting. It is a passive surveillance system and limited by gross underreporting (<10% reporting rate), latency, and inconsistent reporting. We propose a novel team-based intelligent agent software system approach for proactively monitoring and detecting potential ADRs of interest using electronic patient records. We designed such a system and named it ADRMonitor. The intelligent agents, operating on computers located in different places, are capable of continuously and autonomously collaborating with each other and assisting the human users (e.g., the food and drug administration (FDA), drug safety professionals, and physicians). The agents should enhance current systems and accelerate early ADR identification. To evaluate the performance of the ADRMonitor with respect to the current spontaneous reporting approach, we conducted simulation experiments on identification of ADR signal pairs (i.e., potential links between drugs and apparent adverse reactions) under various conditions. The experiments involved over 275 000 simulated patients created on the basis of more than 1000 real patients treated by the drug cisapride that was on the market for seven years until its withdrawal by the FDA in 2000 due to serious ADRs. Healthcare professionals utilizing the spontaneous reporting approach and the ADRMonitor were separately simulated by decision-making models derived from a general cognitive decision model called fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we recently developed. The quantitative simulation results show that 1) the number of true ADR signal pairs detected by the ADRMonitor is 6.6 times higher than that by the spontaneous reporting strategy; 2) the ADR detection rate of the ADRMonitor agents with even moderate decision-making skills is five times higher than that of spontaneous reporting; and 3) as the number of patient cases increases, ADRs could be detected significantly earlier by the ADRMonitor.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2037007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352275","Adverse drug reactions (ADR);fuzzy logic;intelligent agents;postmarketing surveillance;recognition-primed decision (RPD) model","Collaboration;Intelligent agent;Drugs;Safety;Surveillance;Decision making;Delay;Software systems;Patient monitoring;Computerized monitoring","bioinformatics;cooperative systems;decision making;drugs;fuzzy logic;pharmaceutical technology","distributed intelligent agent system;collaborative intelligent agent system;proactive postmarketing drug safety surveillance;adverse drug reaction;spontaneous reporting;passive surveillance system;electronic patient record;ADRMonitor;cisapride;AD 2000;healthcare professional;decision making model;cognitive decision model;fuzzy recognition primed decision model","Cisapride;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Simulation;Decision Making, Computer-Assisted;Drug Toxicity;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Product Surveillance, Postmarketing;Software","14","","42","","11 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study the mechanisms of tactile perception in a task in which a neuro-controlled anthropomorphic robotic arm, equipped with coarse-grained tactile sensors, is required to perceptually categorize spherical and ellipsoid objects. We show that best individuals, synthesized by artificial evolution techniques, develop a close to optimal ability to discriminate the shape of the objects as well as an ability to generalize their skill in new circumstances.

However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989385","","Robots;Training;Instruction sets;Learning (artificial intelligence);Neural networks;Safety;Heuristic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators","deep reinforcement learning;robotic manipulation;asynchronous off-policy updates;autonomous robots;hand-engineered policy representations;human-supplied demonstration;sample complexity;deep Q-functions;3D manipulation skills","","181","","42","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While several papers investigating the impact of various mechanical winding deformations on the transformer FRA signature can be found in the literature, no attention was given to investigate the impact of various bushing faults and transformer oil degradation on the FRA signature. This paper introduces a detailed simulation and practical analyses to elaborate the impact of bushing faults as well as transformer oil degradation on the transformer FRA signature. In this regard, the physical geometrical dimension of a three phase power transformer is simulated using 3D finite element analysis to emulate the real transformer operation. Various bushing faults have been emulated on the studied model and oil degradation is implemented through changing oil permittivity. Practical FRA test is conducted on a three phase 132 kV, 35 MVA power transformer to validate the simulation results.

Recent contributions have shown that it is possible for an agent to discover the structure of its interaction with the environment or its own body via the so-called sensorimotor flow. The presented work is based on this idea, and a method for building an internal representation of sensorimotor interaction is proposed, which does not require any a priori knowledge or model. A careful mathematical formalization is outlined, together with simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. Several cases are considered allowing for a general discussion.

The combination of both the scenario-based and collaborative approaches also contributes to the acquisition of desirable skills linked to general competencies of engineers: scenario analysis/design, interpretation, communication, argumentation, discussion, etc. The paper details the sequence of student activities, justifies the use of collaborative strategies, describes the computational support for collaborative activities, and finally provides evaluation results of this real experience as well as the resulting findings and lessons learned","2377-634X","1-4244-0256-5","10.1109/FIE.2006.322584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4117080","Computer-supported collaborative learning;Network protocols education;Scenario-based learning","Collaborative work;Protocols;Computer networks;Collaboration;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Communication system traffic control;Telecommunication control;Computational modeling;Computer simulation","computer science education;transport protocols","scenario-based learning;network protocols;transmission control protocol;TCP traffic interchange","","7","","20","","5 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Design of open source platform for automatic control systems education based on cooperative learning","J. Á.

The context of this platform arises according to some general educative and technical elements. The first element is to help to the technical processes that the students follow in the design of digital controllers in the automatic control area, e.g., modeling, simulation, evaluation and debug. The second element is focused on the development of a novel open source platform for automatic control, whose aim is to help to improve the educational process of the students in this area. The educational concept of the platform is based on cooperative learning methodology, in which the students collaborate with the platform design according to their needs and expectations. This methodology allowed to know initially the points of view of the students with the aim to establish the perspectives, motivations, skills and weaknesses of them in the automatic control area as well as in the different technical subareas needed in the design of the platform such as programming or signal conditioning. In agreement with the cooperative learning methodology, the construction of the platform was divided in small tasks with objectives clearly defined associated to the learning of the different educational contents in the components of hardware and software needed in the design of it. Our students interacted with each other, sharing common issues and difficulties associated with the technical behavior of the platform. This process increased the group motivation so as to find common aims both technical and human as likewise it encouraged the creativity in search of technical solutions in the design of the platform. The previous steps guarantee the principal concept of the cooperative learning methodology defined as positive interdependence, which is associated to how the student learns the different theoretical and practical educational contents and how this helps to the other group-mates to learn these contents through of the interaction with them.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757605","Cooperative learning;educational methodology;reflection;metacognitive;platform;open source;control system design","Graphical user interfaces;Debugging;Control systems","computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;digital control;public domain software","open source platform design;automatic control systems education;control system learning;collaborative efforts;general educative element;technical element;digital controller design;automatic control area;cooperative learning methodology;programming;signal conditioning","","1","","25","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, the motor originates from different manufacturers and so the parameters are not known prior to start-up of the drive. The inverter utilizes the parameters obtained by extraneous tests and based on a number of assumptions that are not valid under all operating conditions. Therefore, completion of the tuning of all motors in an industrial site is quite time-consuming and is a very tedious job even to skilled engineers. To overcome these problems, the proposed tuning procedure is sensitive to detuning and independent of information of other parameters. The state of detuning is clearly noticeable in the shape of the controller output signal of the drive system. The proposed scheme has the advantage of being extremely general and applicable to a wide range of other systems such as AC/DC boost power converters, surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors (SPMSM), interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM), and so on.

But in many real-world scenarios, the agent is supplied with extremely sparse or even no rewards which makes learning fail and fall into ineffective exploration. In psychology, shaping is a method of animal training by reinforcing successive approximations of rewards to finally achieve the desired complex behavior. Inspired by this phenomenon of animal learning and reward as a signal in neuroscience, in this paper we solve the sparse reward problem by constructing a reward generator to generate inner-rewards and guide the agent learning control policies with deep neural networks. The proposed learning-based reward shaping does not require specific domain knowledge, but rather enable the agent to learn how to generate inner rewards to guide itself in any scenarios online jointly with the actual reinforcement learning process. To validate the performance in complex sparse reward problems, the proposed approach is evaluated in a challenging scenario, Football Academy in Google Research Football Environment, a newly released reinforcement learning environment with physics-based 3D simulator, instead of maze environments or grid world that are commonly used in research which are not sufficiently challenging. We compare the performance of our inner-rewards approach with two reinforcement algorithms (PPO and ICM + PPO). Experimental results show that our method improves the learning performance in terms of speed and quality, and also enables the agent to learn generalized skills applied to novel scenarios.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207302","Reinforcement learning;Football game;Reward shaping;Inner-rewards","Reinforcement learning;Games;Sports;Computational modeling;Neuroscience;Task analysis;Markov processes","computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","animal training;animal learning;reward generator;learning-based reward shaping;complex sparse reward problems;Google Research Football Environment;reinforcement learning environment;sparse reward games;reward signal frames;adaptive inner-reward shaping;goal-directed learning;psychology;neuroscience;agent learning control policies;deep neural networks;Football Academy;physics-based 3D simulator;maze environments","","","","29","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed models are increasingly complex. The first or Atomic-Go model consists of the straightforward measurement of local energy employing the adapted Ising Hamiltonian. The second or Generative Atomic-Go model employs a Deep Belief Network (a generative graphical model popular in machine learning) to generate board configurations and compensate for the lack of information in mostly-empty boards. The third or Molecular-Go model incorporates Common Fate Graphs, which are an alternative representation of the Go board that offers advantages in pattern analysis. The simulated games between different Go playing systems were used to test whether the models are able to capture the energy changes produced by moves between players of different skills. The results indicate that the latter two models reflect said energy differences correctly.

Such an ability to learn by imitation has remained hard to achieve due to a number of factors, including the problem of learning in high-dimensional spaces and the problem of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach to the problem of teaching a high degree-of-freedom robot (in particular, a humanoid robot) flexible and generalizable skills via imitation of a human teacher. The robot uses inference in a graphical model to learn sensor-based dynamics and infer a stable plan from a teacherpsilas demonstration of an action. The novel contribution of this work is a method for learning a nonparametric policy which generalizes a fixed action plan to operate over a continuous space of task variation. A notable feature of the approach is that it does not require any knowledge of the physics of the robot or the environment. By leveraging advances in probabilistic inference and Gaussian process regression, the method produces a nonparametric policy for sensor-based feedback control in continuous state and action spaces. We present experimental and simulation results using a Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot demonstrating imitation-based learning of a task involving lifting objects of different weights from a single human demonstration.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-2057-5","10.1109/IROS.2008.4650778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650778","","Robots;Robot sensing systems;Probabilistic logic;Humans;History;Humanoid robots;Planning","feedback;Gaussian processes;graph theory;humanoid robots;regression analysis;sensors","nonparametric policies;artificial intelligence;human teacher;high-dimensional spaces;probabilistic approach;degree-of-freedom robot;Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot;graphical model;probabilistic inference;Gaussian process regression;sensor-based feedback control","","4","","28","","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An artificial neural network has been trained to recognize the standard mix of fuel and air components in combustion process. The CMAC network has been trained using supervised learning for around 40 fuels and about 12 were used for testing the network performance. Mean square error calculation ensures the effectiveness of the network's performance. Hence the network simulates human behavior, to achieve perfection and skill through AI. The paper presents a new approach for regulating air-fuel balance using neural network that is capable of autonomously learning the amount of air required to burn completely a given amount of fuel through the use of adaptive learning method.

Our framework decomposes transition dynamics into skill effects and success conditions, which allows fast planning by reasoning on effects, while learning conditions from interactions with the world. We propose a simple method for learning new abstract skills, using successful trajectories stemming from completing the goals of a curriculum. Learned skills are then refined to leverage other abstract skills and enhance subsequent planning. We show that both conditions and abstract skills can be learned simultaneously while planning, even in stochastic domains. Our method is validated in experiments of increasing complexity, with up to 2100 states, showing superior planning to classic non-hierarchical planners or reinforcement learning methods.

Sixteen young healthy right- handed subjects (eight female and eight male) were asked to grip and lift the object using the dominant and non-dominant hand separately, and they did not know where the weight was located on the object. During lifting and holding periods, subjects should keep the object stable as far as possible to reduce rotation and tilt. The object peak roll and time interval of compensatory moment increased to 50 N·mm were calculated and quantified to analyze the motor adaptation of both hands. The statistical results had shown with the trial course, both peak roll and time interval had significantly decreased, especially between the first and second trial, indicating reinforced feed-forward and feedback control. However, there was no significant difference between the dominant and the non-dominant hands. These results had revealed the dominant hand was not superior to the non-dominant hand in the motor adaptation including accurate force or torque modulation during unfamiliar object manipulation.

Therefore, an important question arises: how to carry out the online classes of a subject in which the main focus is on developing projects such as the Mechatronics course? This document presents the platforms used in the online course that include: Factory I/O, Overleaf, Tinkercad and FluidSIM, for replacing face-to-face practices. The course development, its characteristics and even the practices that have been done during the online course on the platforms are explained. The main idea is to show that it is possible to substitute the face-to-face practices, using appropriate online tools for each topic within the course. The use of online platforms and simulation software allows obtaining new skills of teaching regarding laboratory subjects. In general, online platforms allow having an alternative and new tools to transform the most of the course to the online mode.","2573-3001","978-1-7281-9904-7","10.1109/ICMEAE51770.2020.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359431","COVID-19;Factory I/O;FluidSIM;Mechatronics;Overleaf;Tinkercad","COVID-19;Mechatronics;Education;Transforms;Tools;Software;Production facilities","computer aided instruction;educational courses;human computer interaction;mechatronics;teaching","laboratory subjects;general platforms;online platforms;online mode;Mechatronics teaching;virtual platforms;home confinement;COVID-19;face-to-face classes;online classes;developing projects;Mechatronics course;online course;replacing face-to-face practices;course development;appropriate online tools","","","","15","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of these devices are point-based, and some haptic interfaces behave like small surfaces that conform to a virtual shape. None of these allow a full-hand contact with the shape, and they are, in general, too small to render big surfaces. The simulation of tasks, such as the exploration of aesthetic surfaces made by industrial designers in order to check the quality of prototypes, require full-hand contact with the shape on a one-to-one scaled representation of the object. These explorations follow trajectories that can be approximated with planar or geodesic curves. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a linear haptic device that is able to render these trajectories. The device is part of a multimodal system including stereoscopic visualization that allows visual representation of the entire surface. Industrial designers use the system for checking the quality of shapes while exploiting their manual and visual skills. The system has been tested by industrial designers and the results are reported in this paper.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2011.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710912","Haptic strip;curve rendering;virtual prototyping;mixed reality;multimodal interfaces;industrial design.","Haptic interfaces;Strips;Shape;Visualization;Mirrors;Trajectory;Head","data visualisation;differential geometry;haptic interfaces;rendering (computer graphics);splines (mathematics);virtual prototyping","geodesic spline interface;haptic curve rendering;haptic interface;planar curve;geodesic curve;linear haptic device;multimodal system;stereoscopic visualization;visual representation;virtual prototyping;industrial design","","23","","32","","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We considered another approach for the control of robotic manipulators using a multi-valued function regularization network (MVRN) approximating a multiple inverse kinematics solution. We assume that we have only the input-output data pairs of joint and Cartesian space for the unknown forward kinematics relation. Using these data, we approximate global inverse kinematics mapping using the MVRN. After approximating the inverse kinematics mapping, we find collision-free joint trajectories like a human being for the given task and the environment. We also adopt an adaptive neural network control scheme for motion control with unknown dynamics. From the global viewpoint, the MVRN may be considered as the long-term memory for relatively unchanging information for the robot manipulator and an adaptive neural network controller can be thought of as the short-term memory for the time-varying information for the change of load and dynamic parameters of the plant. Using these two components, we construct a more general and global control scheme for robotic manipulators.

In this paper, we develop a novel experience-driven approach that can learn to well control a communication network from its own experience rather than an accurate mathematical model, just as a human learns a new skill (such as driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free control in communication networks; and present a novel and highly effective DRL-based control framework, DRL-TE, for a fundamental networking problem: Traffic Engineering (TE). The proposed framework maximizes a widely-used utility function by jointly learning network environment and its dynamics, and making decisions under the guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose two new techniques, TE-aware exploration and actor-critic-based prioritized experience replay, to optimize the general DRL framework particularly for TE. To validate and evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented it in ns-3, and tested it comprehensively with both representative and randomly generated network topologies. Extensive packet-level simulation results show that 1) compared to several widely-used baseline methods, DRL-TE significantly reduces end-to-end delay and consistently improves the network utility, while offering better or comparable throughput; 2) DRL-TE is robust to network changes; and 3) DRL-TE consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art DRL method (for continuous control), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), which, however, does not offer satisfying performance.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485853","Experience-driven Networking;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Traffic Engineering","Mathematical model;Communication networks;Queueing analysis;Resource management;Predictive models;Delays;Aerospace electronics","learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical analysis;neurocontrollers;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","model-free control;TE-aware exploration;deep deterministic policy gradient;communication network topologies;mathematical model;deep neural networks;deep reinforcement learning based approach;experience-driven approach;general DRL-TE framework;traffic engineering;DNN;actor-critic-based prioritized experience replay;packet-level simulation;DDPG","","86","","39","","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach consists of two-block techniques in which the first block selects from a list of contingencies the a priori ""interesting"" ones, that the second block ranks and assesses. This filtering, ranking and assessment (FILTRA) approach relies on SIME (for Single Machine Equivalent). SIME is a hybrid direct-time-domain stability method which combines accuracy and flexibility skills of time-domain methods with sound additional possibilities of direct methods. The FILTRA approach is fully general: it may adapt itself to the specifics of any power system (modeling, protection characteristics, etc.), any contingency scenario and mode of (in)stability (first- or multi-swing, local or inter-area mode) and any application context (planning, operation planning and real-time operation). The approach is illustrated on two EHV power systems, having different structures, control and protective devices. The adequacy of its filtering and ranking capabilities is illustrated in terms of performance criteria such as reliability (ability to consistently capture all dangerous contingencies), effectiveness (ability to avoid false alarms) and computational efficiency (ability to comply with real-time requirements). Further, the assessment task is shown to provide the operator with sound information and effective means of control.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.932279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932279","","Filtering;Power system stability;Power system protection;Power system planning;Power system transients;Power system modeling;Power system reliability;Time domain analysis;Real time systems;Power system control","power system transient stability;power system control;control system analysis;time-domain analysis;power system protection","power system transient stability contingency filtering;power system transient stability contingency ranking;power system transient stability contingency assessment;two-block techniques;FILTRA approach;SIME;Single Machine Equivalent;performance criteria;reliability;effectiveness;control simulation;computational efficiency;EHV power systems","","80","","16","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Elevated tuition costs is another factor pushing people into short, internet-based specialized courses or directly into the job market, while an increasing number of people holding full degrees are underemployed in respect to their knowledge level. We propose VUZ, a domain-general framework capable of tackling these issues by designing personalized curricula from a high-level perspective (general courses, subjects and topics) down to specific how to's and step-by-steps, by means of crowdsourcing: delegating the curriculum development to a community of experts. The framework is scalable in the sense that individuals can choose the level of refinement of their curriculum depending on their prior knowledge; is decentralized in the sense that all decisions are taken by the users; and is collaborative because of the possibility of sharing knowledge with other users. We detailed the crowdsourcing algorithm used for curricula development and simulated a VUZ platform using a multiagent system, which yielded a series of cost and retribution results associated to potential users of a VUZ system.","","978-1-5386-5832-1","10.1109/INFORINO.2018.8581804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8581804","scalable;interdisciplinary;crowdsourcing;curriculum;multiagent;vuz;graphplan","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Education;Planning;Information technology;Tools;Artificial intelligence","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;Internet","crowdsourced framework;scalable interdisciplinary curriculum design;higher education;highly centralized institutions;college degree;domain-general framework;crowdsourcing algorithm;curricula development;VUZ platform;job environment;tuition costs elevation;multiagent system;personalized curricula design;Internet-based specialized courses","","1","","11","","20 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While holding an object, infants also promote its contact with other objects, resulting in object-object interactions that may afford effects not possible otherwise. Depending on the characteristics of both the held object (intermediate) and the acted object (primary), systematic outcomes may occur, leading to the emergence of a primitive concept of tool. In this paper we describe experiments with a humanoid robot exploring object-object interactions in a playground scenario and learning a probabilistic causal model of the effects of actions as functions of the characteristics of both objects. The model directly links the objects' 2D shape visual cues to the effects of actions. Because no object recognition skills are required, generalization to novel objects is possible by exploiting the correlations between the shape descriptors. We show experiments where an affordance model is learned in a simulated environment, and is then used on the real robotic platform, showing generalization abilities in effect prediction. We argue that, despite the fact that during exploration no concept of tool is given to the system, this very concept may emerge from the knowledge that intermediate objects lead to significant effects when acting on other objects.","2161-9476","978-1-4799-7540-2","10.1109/DEVLRN.2014.6983027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983027","","Bayes methods;Visualization;Shape;Robot kinematics;Probabilistic logic;Biological system modeling","humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","intermediate object affordance learning;object grasping;object manipulation;robotics;objects affordances;object-object interaction;object characteristics;probabilistic causal model;shape visual cue;shape descriptors;effect prediction","","10","","29","","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PICMET '97","6 Aug 2002","1997","","","363","","Summary form only given. This paper describes the merits and demerits of presently organized Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) Structures and proposes an effective structure of TCAD organization for the continued success of today's semiconductor design and manufacturing companies. This study shows that the different TCAD functions are either distributed among the primary groups in the value chain of the firm or organized under a primary corporate function. Each distributed function of TCAD focuses on application specific usage to assist the respective primary function. On the other hand, an integrated TCAD group provides software and hardware support, application and user training, benchmarking of tools, and out-sourcing coordination. Traditionally, the semiconductor companies rely on outside expertise and support for critical usage of TCAD for their immediate needs and maintain a cost-effective structure for TCAD. However, the lack of in-house expertise and corporate support to address the critical issues of TCAD may cost competitive advantage of the firm in the long run. In general, the success of advanced product design, technology development, and manufacturing relies on efficient TCAD application methodologies, accurate process and device models, efficient algorithms for higher simulation throughput, and skilled engineering staff. In addition, to realize the full potential of TCAD in today's integrated circuit design and manufacturing, proper integration of TCAD tools into a system is extremely important.","","0-7803-3574-0","10.1109/PICMET.1997.653412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=653412","","Design automation;Application software;Computer aided manufacturing;Pulp manufacturing;Semiconductor device manufacture;Collaborative software;Software tools;Hardware;Costs;Product design","integrated circuit design;circuit CAD;manufacturing industries;electronics industry;outsourcing;management;product development","Technology Computer-Aided Design organization;TCAD organization structure;semiconductor design companies;manufacturing companies;value chain;primary corporate function;primary function;hardware support;software support;user training;tools benchmarking;out-sourcing coordination;cost-effective structure;competitive advantage;advanced product design;technology development;accurate process models;accurate device models;skilled engineering staff;integrated circuit design;manufacturing process control","","4","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Widely used single threshold methods still rely on the experience of the operator to manually establish a threshold level. In this paper, a novel approach to address this issue is presented. Based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, the maximum likelihood (ML) method is improved with an adaptive threshold technique based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate in the initial time before accurate sEMG analyses. The dependence of optimal threshold on SNR is determined by minimizing the onset/offset estimate error on a large set of simulated signals with well-known signal parameters. Accuracy and precision of the algorithm were assessed by using a set of simulated signals and real sEMG signals recorded from two healthy subjects during elbow flexion-extension movements with and without workload. Comparison with traditional algorithms shows that with a moderate increase in the computational effort the ML algorithm performs well even for low levels of EMG activity, while the proposed adaptive method is most robust with respect to variations in SNRs. Also, we discuss the results of analyzing the sEMG recordings from the selected proximal muscles of the upper limb in two hemiparetic subjects. The detection algorithm is automatic and user-independent, managing the detection of both onset and offset activation, and is applicable in presence of noise allowing use by skilled and unskilled operators alike.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2226916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353938","Adaptive decision threshold;electromyography (EMG) signal;maximum likelihood method;muscle contraction","Muscles;Signal to noise ratio;Electromyography;Standards;Algorithm design and analysis;Maximum likelihood estimation;Signal processing algorithms","adaptive estimation;biomechanics;bone;electromyography;maximum likelihood estimation;medical signal processing","adaptive algorithm;onset muscle contraction determination;offset muscle contraction determination;EMG signal processing;on-off timing;human skeletal muscle movement;surface electromyography signal processing;clinical applications;generalized likelihood ratio testing;maximum likelihood method;adaptive threshold technique;signal-to-noise ratio estimate;onset-offset estimate error;signal parameters;elbow flexion-extension movements;proximal muscles;upper limb;hemiparetic subjects","Algorithms;Electromyography;Feedback;Humans;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","46","1","26","","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An adversary can inflict severe damage to the underlying physical system by compromising the control and monitoring applications facilitated by the cyber layer. Protection of critical assets from electronic threats has traditionally been done through conventional cyber security measures that involve host-based and network-based security technologies. However, it has been recognized that highly skilled attacks can bypass these security mechanisms to disrupt the smooth operation of control systems. There is a growing need for cyber-attack-resilient control techniques that look beyond traditional cyber defense mechanisms to detect highly skilled attacks. In this paper, we make the following contributions. We first demonstrate the impact of data integrity attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on power system frequency and electricity market operation. We propose a general framework to the application of attack resilient control to power systems as a composition of smart attack detection and mitigation. Finally, we develop a model-based anomaly detection and attack mitigation algorithm for AGC. We evaluate the detection capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm through simulation studies. Our results show that the algorithm is capable of detecting scaling and ramp attacks with low false positive and negative rates. The proposed model-based mitigation algorithm is also efficient in maintaining system frequency within acceptable limits during the attack period.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2298195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740883","Anomaly detection;automatic generation control;intrusion detection systems;kernel density estimation;supervisory control and data acquisition","Automatic generation control;Generators;Power system stability;Electricity supply industry;Frequency measurement;Power measurement","data integrity;frequency control;power system control;power system reliability;power system stability;security of data","model-based mitigation algorithm;ramp attacks;scaling attacks;attack mitigation algorithm;model-based anomaly detection algorithm;smart attack mitigation;smart attack detection;attack resilient control;electricity market operation;power system frequency;AGC;automatic generation control;data integrity attacks;cyber-attack-resilient control techniques;network-based security technologies;host-based security technologies;cyber security measures;electronic threats;critical assets protection;cyber layer;physical system;power system operation reliability;cyber systems","","195","","30","","20 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite well-designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. Robots under a sense-plan-act paradigm do not have an additional loop to check their actions. In this work, we present a principled methodology to bootstrap online robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we seek to enable the robot to recognize and expect its behavior, else detect anomalies. We postulated that noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is obtained by segmenting and encoding data. And when wrench information represents a sequence of sub-tasks, the vocabulary represents a set of words or sentence and provides a unique identifier. The grammar, which can also include unexpected events, was classified both offline and online for simulated and real robot experiments. Multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used offline, while online probabilistic SVMs were used to give temporal confidence to the introspection result. Our work's contribution is the presentation of a generalizable online semantic scheme that enables a robot to understand its high-level state whether nominal or anomalous. It is shown to work in offline and online scenarios for a particularly challenging contact task: snap assemblies. We perform the snap assembly in one-arm simulated and real one-arm experiments and a simulated two-arm experiment. The data set itself is also fully available online and provides a valuable resource by itself for this type of contact task. Our verification mechanism can be used by high-level planners or reasoning systems to enable intelligent failure recovery or determine the next most optimal manipulation skill to be used.

Nevertheless, the general limitations of the techniques are of equal importance: 1) the techniques are difficult in some subjects due to obesity and anatomical variations; 2) the technique cannot examine tissues surrounded by air or bone; 3) the techniques require operator skill and a thorough knowledge of human anatomy and cardiovascular dynamics; 4) the techniques have finite spatial resolutions which may compromise the important measurement of vessel diameter, ulceration, and percent stenosis; and 5) the techniques have finite velocity measuring capabilities which may compromise some measurements of highly disturbed blood velocities outside the range of 2-200 cm/sec. As clinical demands for the early diagnosis and quantification of vascular lesions increased, improvements in Doppler ultrasonics and spectra analysis significantly increased the technical and clinical capabilities of existing simple, inexpensive instruments. Presently, both anatomical and physiological images along with quantitative Doppler spectra from superficial and deep-lying vessels can be obtained. Consequently, the ability of new expensive imaging equipment to quantitate atherosclerotic lesions using spectral analysis techniques compares favorably with the interpretational precision of standard invasive or intravenous digital angiography.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.1982.4307550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4307550","","Atherosclerosis;Ultrasonic imaging;Lesions;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Velocity measurement;Bones;Human anatomy;Cardiology;Spatial resolution;Blood","","","","7","2","65","","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing industrial DM platforms and approaches do not suit IoT devices and are already showing their limits with a few static home devices (e.g., routers, TV Decoders). Indeed, undetected buggy firmware deployment and manual target device identification are common issues in existing systems. Besides, these platforms are manually operated by experts (e.g., system administrators) and require extensive knowledge and skills. Such approaches cannot be applied on massive and diverse devices forming the IoT. To tackle these issues, our work in an industrial research context proposes to apply autonomic computing to DM platforms operation and impact tracking. Specifically, our contribution relies on automated device targeting (i.e., aiming only suitable devices) and impact-aware DM (i.e., error and anomalies detection preceding patch generalization on all suitable devices of a given fleet). Our solution is composed of three coordinated autonomic loops and allows more accurate and faster irregularity diagnosis, vertical scaling along with simpler IoT DM platform administration. For experimental validation, we developed a prototype that demonstrates encouraging results compared to simulated legacy telecommunication operator approaches (namely Orange).","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222888","device management;multiple loop cooperation;internet of things;firmware update;configuration management","","computer network management;computer network security;firmware;Internet of Things","user experience;bug corrections;security patches distribution;industrial DM platforms;IoT devices;static home devices;undetected buggy firmware deployment;manual target device identification;system administrators;extensive knowledge;industrial research context;autonomic computing;impact tracking;automated device;impact-aware DM;anomalies detection;coordinated autonomic loops;simulated legacy telecommunication operator approaches;target identification;heterogeneous deployed devices;massively deployed devices;remote administration;firmware update;troubleshooting;proper quality;error-aware device management;dynamic deployed devices;IoT DM platform administration","","","","30","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some suffer from high generalization error that reduces the accuracy or require large-scale data collection. The role of sensory feedback is therefore important to adapt the action. We present a control framework to learn grasping with a soft gripper attached to a humanoid robot arm. The inverse kinematic model of the arm is acquired through motor babbling of a central pattern generator and encoded by a feed-forward neural network. To overcome the generalization error we provide the gripper with a tactile sensors array at each finger. The tactile servoing is used to correct the action before grasping. The proposed model has been tested in simulation, and on the real robot where a soft sensory gripper was used to interact with a human subject (Tactile Servoing). Successful grasping was achieved thanks to the integration of a learned inverse model with the sensory feedback.","2164-0580","978-1-5386-7283-9","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2018.8625035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625035","","Neurons;Robot sensing systems;Grasping;Kinematics;Grippers;Robot kinematics","calibration;feedback;feedforward neural nets;grippers;humanoid robots;manipulators;neurocontrollers;position control;tactile sensors","central pattern generator;feed-forward neural network;tactile sensors array;tactile servoing;soft sensory gripper;sensory feedback;humanoid robot grasping;soft gripper;humanoid robots;human environment;high order nonlinearity;neural-based representations;dedicated calibration process;large-scale data collection;humanoid robot arm;inverse kinematic model","","","","9","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a dynamic motion capture equipment is used to acquire the human's demonstration. The nonlinear terms of DMP is learned through local weighted regression (LWR) algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified by simulating the one-dimensional and two-dimensional trajectories in MATLAB and applying it to the existing household humanoid service robot in the laboratory.","","978-1-7281-6479-3","10.1109/ICARM49381.2020.9195273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195273","","Trajectory;Hidden Markov models;Manipulators;Service robots;Dynamics;Planning","differential equations;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;motion control;nonlinear control systems;path planning;regression analysis;robot dynamics;service robots;trajectory control","arm planning;dynamic movement primitive;trajectory planning;robotic arms;differential equations;DMP;human body demonstration;human actions;nonlinear terms;dynamic motion capture equipment;household humanoid service robot;autonomous motor learning skills;systematic framework;local weighted regression algorithm;two-dimensional trajectories;one-dimensional trajectories;MATLAB","","","","26","","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal applications are those tasks which cannot be fully programmed due to uncertainties and incomplete knowledge. The proposed sensor-based architecture combines several learning paradigms as well as pre-programmed modules, since experimental evidence suggests that some paradigms are more convenient for learning certain skills. The correspondence between qualitative states and actions is learnt. The qualitative treatment of information makes it suitable for the analysis of system behavior, knowledge extraction and generalization to other more complex tasks. Programming is used to decrease the complexity of the learning process. This general approach is a suitable scheme for a wide range of robot situations.

Many previous approaches focus on maximizing a single utility function and require large datasets of experience to do this, something that is not possible to collect outside of simulation as every data point is expensive both in time and in a potential wear down of the robot. This paper addresses this question using a newly developed framework called Finite Element Goal Babbling (FEGB). FEGB is an online learning method that aims at providing general control over some measurable feature, in contrast to optimizing it to some given utility function. It generalizes standard goal babbling by breaking down the full learning problem into local sub-problems, and combining it with a planner that learns how to navigate between these subproblems. We test FEGB using a real humanoid robot Nao, and find that it could quickly learn to robustly control its body orientation. After only 20-30 minutes of training, the robot could freely move into any body orientation between lying on either side and on its back. Rapid learning of body orientation control in high dimensional real robots is largely an unexplored field of robotics, and although many challenges remain, FEGB shows a feasible approach to the problem.","2153-0866","978-1-5386-8094-0","10.1109/IROS.2018.8593762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593762","","Task analysis;Aerospace electronics;Finite element analysis;Space exploration;Humanoid robots;Robot sensing systems","control engineering computing;finite element analysis;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;position control;robust control","finite element goal babbling;utility function maximization;Nao humanoid robot;robust control;online learning method;FEGB;body orientation control;time 20.0 min to 30.0 min","","2","","24","","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At KIT the Focus Anthropomatics and Robotics - APR has been set up by a number of research groups focusing on the research field of Anthropomatics and Robotics with more than 250 researchers. Modelling humans and their capabilities requires a deep understanding of the principle of biomechanics and kinematics, as well as the underlaying neural control principles and the perceptive and actuatoric system. Modelling and understanding of the sensomotoric mechanisms, learning and developement of skills and cognititve capabilities to enable humans to interact with the world is of high importance to design technical systems operating closely and interactively with humans via various modalities like speech, haptics, vision, grasping and locomotion. Typical research fields are related to active vision, interpretation of scenes and human activities, recognition and tracking technologies multimodal & perceptual user interfaces, understanding and translation of speech. Complementary research needed is related to the retrieval & access and summarization of multimedia data sources, translation of spoken text, context aware learning computers, implicit services and many more. The robotics application field ranges from interactive industrial robotics, service robotic companions, humanoids and medical robotics. In all domains the integrating aspects are focusing on algorithms processing real word data as well as open self-organizing architectures which allow autonomy, skill and task learning as well as interaction with humans. Our research emphasizes the critical path from basic understanding of cognitive processes and robotics foundations to applications in various domains. The research includes new approaches to sensor and actuator methodologies, foundations of machine perception, motion and action planning algorithms, simulation and computer graphics, robot machine learning, speech recognition and understanding, multimodal man-machine interaction, and many others. APR addresses the needs of humans in smart living environments and robotics focusing on both, basic foundations and applications. The focus has an intellectual center point on Anthropomatics and a commitment to Robotics as a new human centered discipline. The research is to explore new ideas and to build systematically systems which reflect human daily needs and a basic understanding of intelligent robots and adaptive safe system behaviour in general. Such cognitive robots are able to do tasks skillfully and efficiently together with humans, and they should be able to operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas. Furthermore, future robots should discover new things and learn new capabilities and knowledge about their environment and they should be able to reason about the effects of their actions and interventions. Thus, the basic capabilities to perform intelligent actions in the real world are perception, cognition, locomotion and skillful manipulation.

The main insulating material of the SJB is a polypropylene laminated paper (PPLP), which is already generally used for dc HTS power cable. In order to separate the cooling section, an epoxy spacer is located at the center of the SJB. Due to the weakness of surface breakdown characteristics compared with that of punctual breakdown and different nature of dc electric field distribution determined by the ratio of conductivities of dielectric materials, the epoxy spacer configuration of the SJB should be carefully designed based on dc electric field analysis. In this paper, the optimum configuration of the epoxy spacer of the SJB was investigated based on dc electric field analysis. On the basis of the initial SJB model, which is already designed for the joint box of the conventional ac oil-filled power cable, a variety of improved SJB models with different epoxy spacer configurations were considered. In dc electric field simulations, the main objective was to reduce the tangential dc electric field intensity at the interface between PPLP and epoxy spacer. To find the optimum epoxy spacer configuration, a parametric sweep technique was applied, and an appropriate SJB model could be identified. However, its tangential dc electric field intensity remained still higher than that of the design criteria for the dc electric field from the experimental results. Therefore, as a novel method, a thin Kraft layer between the PPLP and the epoxy spacer was added to reduce electric field intensification. The simulation result of the newly designed insulation structure revealed the possibility of lowering the tangential electric field. Furthermore, different electrical conductivity values were applied to the additional layer instead of the original Kraft value in order to meet the critical electric field intensity. Finally, 1E-11 S/m, among those values, showed the best simulation result, which was lower than the design criteria for the dc electric field. To verify the effect of the additional layer for dc electric field mitigation, miniature SJB specimens were fabricated, and dc breakdown tests were performed using a step-by-step test method. Based on the experimental results, SJB specimens with an additional layer showed the highest breakdown strength compared with that of SJB specimens without an additional layer. Thus, the optimum configuration of SJB determined by dc electric field analysis was approved by experimental works. Consequently, these insulation design skills based on dc electric field analysis could be usefully adopted in developing the SJB of 80-kV dc HTS power cables.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2015.2507122","Basic Science Research Program; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education; Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358025","Breakdown test;DC;Electric field analysis;Epoxy spacer;FEM;Kraft;HTS Cable;Parametric sweep;PPLP;Breakdown test;dc;electric field analysis;epoxy spacer;finite-element method;high-temperature superconducting (HTS) cable;Kraft;parametric sweep;polypropylene laminated paper (PPLP)","Electric fields;Power cables;High-temperature superconductors;Superconducting cables;Electric breakdown;Insulation;Conductivity","electric fields;electrical conductivity;epoxy insulation;high-temperature superconductors;insulating oils;paper;power cable insulation;superconducting cables","breakdown strength;step-by-step test method;electric field intensification reduction;thin Kraft layer;tangential DC electric field intensity;oil-filled power cable;epoxy spacer configuration;DC electric field distribution;surface breakdown;SJB insulating material;PPLP;polypropylene laminated paper;long-distance transmission cable connection;high-temperature superconducting power cable;DC electric field analysis;stop joint box insulation design;DC HTS cable;voltage 80 kV","","6","","23","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, the European Union also proclaimed lifelong learning based on Europe of knowledge as the key development guideline in the first decade of the 21st century. The goal of this paper is to present and analyze the phenomenon of lifelong education of maritime officials in `Split Ship Management', Split, to be precise, in its Nautical training centre, known as `Training Centre'. The mariner education project arose from cooperation with world education centers which use the most recent aspects of maritime theory and practice, both in the domestic and wider world expertise context adjusted to the latest European Union criteria. It is worth emphasizing the growing popularity of additional maritime trainings in the world as a necessity of the development of new knowledges and skills in various areas in maritime economy, which are becoming a basis for further development both with individuals and companies. Trainings are conducted in computerized laboratories and on a simulator. This formal framework used for shaping and performing trainings at the Nautical training centre is based on the current knowledge and experience of trainers and their constant strive for modernization and professional knowledge quality improvement, as well as for knowledge in general as a basic principle of development.","","978-9-5323-3050-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533570","","Management training;Marine vehicles;Engines;Computational modeling;Navigation;Computer simulation;Continuing education;Technology management;Educational technology;Bridges","computer based training;continuing professional development;marine engineering","lifelong seafarer education;formal education;split ship management;nautical training centre;mariner education project;European Union criteria","","","","3","","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture has been a suitable device for parallel computing in simulating multi-cellular systems. However, in modeling complex biological systems, scientists often face two tasks, mathematical formulation and skillful programming. In particular, specific programming skills are needed for GPU programming. Therefore, the development of an easy-to-use computational architecture, which utilizes GPU for parallel computing and provides intuitive interfaces for simple implementation, is needed so that general scientists can perform GPU simulations without knowing much about the GPU architecture. Here, we introduce ParaCells, a cell-centered GPU simulation architecture for NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA). ParaCells was designed as a versatile architecture that connects the user logic (in C++) with NVIDIA CUDA runtime and is specific to the modeling of multi-cellular systems. An advantage of ParaCells is its object-oriented model declaration, which allows it to be widely applied to many biological systems through the combination of basic biological concepts. We test ParaCells with two applications. Both applications are significantly faster when compared with sequential as well as parallel OpenMP and OpenACC implementations. Moreover, the simulation programs based on ParaCells are cleaner and more readable than other versions.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2018.2814570","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8314131","GPU;CUDA;multi-cellular system;cell-based model;computational biology","Computer architecture;Object oriented modeling;Biological system modeling;Microprocessors;Graphics processing units;Computational modeling;Mathematical model","biology computing;graphics processing units;parallel architectures","ParaCells;GPU architecture;cell-centered models;computational biology;graphics processing unit architecture;parallel computing;multicellular systems;GPU programming;cell-centered GPU simulation architecture;NVIDIA compute unified device architecture;object-oriented model declaration;intuitive interfaces;complex biological systems","","4","","43","","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As boards become more dense and more complex, debug of functional failures will become more and more difficult. Test strategies try to detect and diagnose failures early on in the test process (component and structural tests), but inevitably some defects are not detected until functional testing is done on the board. Finding these defects usually requires an ""expert"", with engineering level skills in both hardware and software. Depending on the complexity of the product, it could take several months (even years) to develop this level of expertise. During the initial product ramp, this expertise is usually most needed and often unavailable. Debug time is usually very long and scrap rates are generally high. This paper will provide an overview of reasoning-based diagnosis techniques and how they can significantly decrease debug time, especially during new product introduction. Because these engines are ""model-based"", there is no guarantee how they will perform in real life. In almost all cases, the reasoning engine will have to be modified based on instances where the reasoning engine could not correctly identify the failing component. Making these adjustments to the reasoning is a very complex and sometimes risky endeavor. While the new model may correctly identify the previously missed failure, the reasoning may have been altered to a point where several other diagnoses have now been unknowingly compromised. This paper will propose enhancements to the reasoning engine that will allow a simpler approach to adapting to diagnostic escapes without risking compromises to the original diagnostic engine","2378-2250","0-7803-9038-5","10.1109/TEST.2005.1583974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583974","","Engines;Inference mechanisms;Cost function;Circuit testing;System testing;Hardware;Production systems;Adders;Manufacturing processes;Bayesian methods","automatic test pattern generation;case-based reasoning;fault simulation;printed circuit testing","reasoning diagnosis;production defects;backend costs;functional test failures debugging;manufacturing process;failure detection;failure diagnosis;test process;component tests;structural tests;functional testing;debug time;reasoning engine;failing component","","23","1","7","","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to discover and learn these synergies from scratch through model-free deep reinforcement learning. Our method involves training two fully convolutional networks that map from visual observations to actions: one infers the utility of pushes for a dense pixel-wise sampling of end-effector orientations and locations, while the other does the same for grasping. Both networks are trained jointly in a Q-learning framework and are entirely self-supervised by trial and error, where rewards are provided from successful grasps. In this way, our policy learns pushing motions that enable future grasps, while learning grasps that can leverage past pushes. During picking experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we find that our system quickly learns complex behaviors even amid challenging cases of tightly packed clutter, and achieves better grasping success rates and picking efficiencies than baseline alternatives after a few hours of training.

The system is supported by the Texas General Land Office as part of its mission to mitigate the effect of catastrophic oil spills on the Texas Coast. Buoys communicate surface currents and water temperature measured at 2m depth in near real time via cell phone and commercial satellite digital data links. One buoy located at East Flower Garden Banks has a 300 kHz ADCP, a meteorology package with an ultrasonic acoustic wind velocity sensor, and a conductivity sensor. Data are posted regularly to a Web page http://www.gerg.tamu.edu/tglo and are available to the public and governments within a few hours after data collection. On the TABS Web page, a graphical map presentation of TABS current vectors has links to data tables and historical databases. Links are also provided to other data resources for oceanographic data in the Gulf of Mexico. Also on the Web page are links to an automated continental shelf forecast system that predicts currents over the Texas-Louisiana shelf on an operational basis. There are four major components in this system: (1) forecast wind field retrieving and preparation, (2) shelf circulation model module, (3) simulation plotting module and (4) Web display and file transfer module. The wind field used is a 3-hour interval ETA-22 forecast gridded wind from NOAA NCEP based on 00, 06, 12, and 18UTC model runs. The shelf circulation model is a 3-D version of Princeton Ocean Model (POM) on a domain extending from the coast to a curved line extending from 25/spl deg/N on the Mexican coast to 85/spl deg/W at the coastline of Florida. The operational POM model used at this time is a simplified barotropic version that permits us to reduce computational time to allow prediction of surface currents twenty-four hours into the future. The data vs. model comparison from April through December, 1999 of nine nearshore TABS buoys indicates modest skill of the model in predicting the wind driven circulation. A fully baroclinic version of TABS-POM model is undergoing tests and will be implemented on an operational basis when sufficient computational resources become available. We are also developing data-assimilating models of the whole Gulf of Mexico and beyond to couple to our shelf model to supply outer boundary conditions.","","0-933957-28-9","10.1109/OCEANS.2001.968300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968300","","Sea measurements;Wind forecasting;Predictive models;Web pages;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement;Acoustic sensors;Petroleum;Land surface temperature","wind;oceanographic regions;oceanographic equipment;information resources;data acquisition;radiotelemetry;marine telemetry;atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric measuring apparatus;geophysics computing","coastal currents;Texas Automated Buoy System;TABS;Brownsville;Sabine;catastrophic oil spills;surface currents;water temperature;East Flower Garden Banks;Web page;graphical map presentation;Gulf of Mexico;Texas-Louisiana shelf;wind field;forecast;shelf circulation model module;simulation plotting module;Web display and file transfer module;Princeton Ocean Model;POM;barotropic version;TABS-POM model;data-assimilating models","","3","","5","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"FPGA development in ATE","S. Hu","Defense and Aerospace, Systems Test Group, Teradyne, North Reading, MA","2017 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","26 Oct 2017","2017","","","1","5","In recent years, synthetic test instruments have become increasingly popular in the automatic test equipment (ATE) market. This type of instrument gives users the ability to create custom solutions to better meet their test requirements. FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based solutions are the most common synthetic test instrument on the market today. FPGA based solutions can work well due to their inherent flexibility and programmability. They offer high bandwidth outputs and scalable design components, and the design can be easily maintained or transported. The portability of FPGA based solutions is especially advantageous in cases where designs must be maintained over long periods of time, as they can be transferred between test instruments as those are changed or upgraded. However, FPGA design can be complicated and requires increased initial investment. When compared with traditional general-purpose test instruments, the development period tends to be longer. Additionally, while implementing FPGA designs may seem similar to software programming, it requires a different set of skills. To alleviate some of these technical hurdles and to speed up the initial development process, instrument manufacturers offer various solutions to guide the development and ease the implementation process. Test engineers should be aware of the specific complexities that exist for successfully developing FPGA based solutions, how these are offset by the benefits, and how each can be mitigated using appropriate strategies. As an example, using hardware description language (HDL) requires a learning curve, but results in improved portability. If long term maintenance of the test program is critical, HDL designs can be easily transferred from obsolete instruments to new instruments with next generation FPGAs. Though HDL is one of several development methodologies that can be used, the scope of this paper will be limited to examples using HDL. Aspects of initial setup, interfacing with many peripherals, and simulation can also pose challenges. Real world examples of these challenges will be discussed alongside suggestions on how to address them, including discussion of offerings from instrument vendors that can help with developing a successful test.","1558-4550","978-1-5090-4922-6","10.1109/AUTEST.2017.8080480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8080480","FPGA;Field Programmable Gate Array;Synthetic Instrument;HDL","Field programmable gate arrays;Instruments;Hardware design languages;Tools;Logic gates;Hardware;Software","automatic test equipment;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;logic design","test program;test engineers;instrument manufacturers;general-purpose test instruments;FPGA design;FPGA based solutions;common synthetic test instrument;Field Programmable Gate Array;test requirements;automatic test equipment market;synthetic test instruments;ATE;FPGA development;instrument vendors;obsolete instruments;HDL designs","","","","5","","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a social problem growing in countries that are ageing. Opioid drugs are expected as a long-lasting pain inhibitor or relief for chronic pain. However, due to the addiction and strict national control, using opioids could not accepted by most patients as a general treatment stimulating unmyelinated nerve fibers: C fibers near the sarcolemma using needle electrodes, or acupuncture could induce the secretion of endogenous opioid. However, due to the invasiveness of needle treatment and the expert skill needed, it is difficult to apply to family individuals. Endogenous-opioid-based pain relief by selective stimulation through surface electrodes is a strong candidate to push the pain relief technology into a home environment. In this study, we simulated the C and Aδ fibers using the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model and the MRG model, respectively. Bipolar Square Waves (BSW) and Bipolar high frequency modulated wave (BMP) of different frequencies were tested. The effects of frequency bands, ISI (inter-stimulation interval) and polarity asymmetry on the selectivity of C fiber were investigated. This study contributes to the understanding of the selective stimulation of C and Aδ fibers. The stimulation with the frequency lower than 100 Hz and asymmetric waveform may have potential clinical application of pain suppression.","","978-1-7281-3448-2","10.1109/ICCEM47450.2020.9219355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9219355","chronic pain;C fibers;selective stimulation;asymmetric waveform","","bioelectric potentials;neurophysiology;patient treatment","pain suppression;chronic pain relief;social problem;opioid drugs;needle electrodes;endogenous opioid;needle treatment;endogenous-opioid-based pain relief;surface electrodes;pain relief technology;Hodgkin-Huxley model;bipolar square waves;bipolar high-frequency modulated wave;stimulating unmyelinated nerve fibers;interstimulation interval","","","","12","","12 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such active surfaces are a generalisation of snake contours common in many image processing applications.

However, fMRI cannot characterize the temporal properties of motor response competition and motor activation in general. We studied the development of the time course of resolving motor response competition. To this end, we used the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an ERP measure, for tracking correct and incorrect motor cortex activation in children in real time. Fourteen children and 14 adults took part in an animal-size Stroop task where they selected between two animals, presented simultaneously on the computer screen, which was larger in real life. In the incongruent condition, the LRP detected stronger and longer lasting incorrect response activation in children than in adults. LRP results could explain behavioral congruency effects, the generally longer RT in children than in adults and the larger congruency effect in children than in adults. In contrast, the peak latency of ERP waves, usually associated with stimulus processing speed, could explain neither of the above effects. We conclude that the development of resolving motor response competition, relying on motor inhibition skills, is a crucial factor in child development. Our study demonstrates that the LRP is an excellent tool for studying motor activation in children.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.2009.21220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793663","","","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

This paper investigates how art education could be integrated into STEM-based engineering curricula to improve creativity, critical thinking, reasoning skills, aesthetic sensibilities and appreciation. This new STEAM-based approach is explored in three different case studies for courses in electrical circuits, digital design, and control systems to highlight its correlation to the designed course learning outcomes of the syllabi and how to implement it using small projects, lab experiments, or conducting active simulations. General attributes of art education are tied to the courses' contents, with focus on the amount of details, structure, and organization of specific applications such as photography, painting, sculpture, and fashion design. The main contribution of this paper is to raise awareness to the value of art in engineering programs, especially for academic institutions that adopt a liberal arts approach. A rich discussion is given to address extensions to other courses and labs in different engineering programs, while addressing novel pedagogical approaches to better equip the students for the 21st century workplace. The multidisciplinary nature of STEAM-based education is also investigated as an important tool to improve the quality of the capstone design projects of the students at the senior level.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125367","Active Learning;STEAM;Project-based Learning","","art;computer science education;control engineering education;educational courses;electrical engineering education;further education;STEM","fashion design;liberal arts approach;courses;engineering programs;pedagogical approaches;STEAM-based education;capstone design projects;STEAM-based active learning approach;engineering students;higher education;art education;STEM-based engineering curricula;critical thinking;reasoning skills;aesthetic sensibilities;STEAM-based approach;electrical circuits;digital design;control systems;designed course;lab experiments;active simulations;electrical engineering;computer engineering","","","","18","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biologists have discovered that cockatoos are intrinsically motivated to explore and solve such problems through physical explorative behavior. In this work, we study how different strategies shape the robots' exploration, given basic perception-action skills. Our evaluation highlights the influence of different statistical priors on the performance of the exploration strategies, showing that not only a range of computational methods, but also a range of priors could explain different exploration behaviors. We carry out our study of exploration strategies both in simulation and on two robot platforms. This first step towards a fully integrated real-world system allowed us to identify and remove limitations of our prior theoretical work on cross-entropy-based exploration when applied to complex realistic scenarios.

Moreover, reading is the well-known brain exercise which helps the brain to improve concentration, promotes empathy, and helps the brain to effectively construct links between neurons. If a person can often keep reading habits, reading is the best exercise to prevent loss of cognitive function in old age. With the advanced development of the Internet and the popularity of electron carriers, electronic books (e-books) have been as computer-aided tools to help students learn in the classroom teaching activities. Sensing and clouding storage technologies are used as tools to assist teachers in teaching students to understand the learning status and learning achievement. In general, reading mainly is divided into two phases, learning to read, and reading to learn. In order to understand the learning status of students, teachers observe the learning behavior of students and analyze their learning ability and skills to adjust the teaching strategies and teaching progresses for adaptive learning in classrooms. In order to help teachers effectively observe students' learning, this study proposed a cloudized e-book reading rate tracking system (CERRTS) with an e-book learning environment and the proposed system includes the sensing technology of touch screen and the cloudized technology of storage. In order to verify the function of the proposed system, the study used a camera to record the learning status of students and to compare the reading rate of the system records and the reading rate of the camera recording.

A scoping review was conducted to explore current research at the intersect of the Business model and Industry 4.0 research domains. The research question we pose thus is a general one: What is the nature of the evidence for Business model innovation in the context of Industry 4.0? The main impacts of Industry 4.0 on 1) industry, 2) products and services, 3) economy, 4) work environment and 5) skills development were mapped. We then conclude by reflecting on these drivers that Industry 4.0 holds a huge potential for business models to become renewed, improved, changed and novel.

A carillonneur's performance depends on a developing familiarity with force-feedback associated with a particular instrument. Force-feedback may vary not only across the range of the instrument but from one instrument to another. However, carillonneurs have restricted access to their instrument for rehearsal, unlike musicians who specialise in other instruments. At best, rehearsal times on the actual instrument are shared with other carillonneurs; at worst, a carilloneur rehearses mainly on a practice instrument that does not prepare them for the force-feedback and sonic characteristics of the actual instrument. A haptic device that simulates the force-feedback of a carillon must meet exacting requirements associated with musical performance and musical skill acquisition. Our haptic device uses a voice-coil linear actuator in a position-control loop where the force applied by a carillonneur is measured by analysing the noisy current produced from an analog servo controller reacting to position error. A parametised model of the servo is determined using system identification methods and forms the basis of a Kalman filter for the servo current signal, closing an admittance display loop around carillonneur-applied forces and the mechanical action of the instrument simulated in a virtual environment. This generalised method is particularly applicable to scenarios common in creative applications where hardware is `handed-down' from other projects.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-1736-8","10.1109/IROS.2012.6386148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386148","","Force;Actuators;Haptic interfaces;Instruments;Servomotors;Force measurement;Dynamics","force sensors;haptic interfaces;Kalman filters;musical instruments;signal processing","haptic musical instrument;multisignal fusion;force sensing;force sensors;force feedback;carillonneurs performance;sonic characteristics;actual instrument;haptic device;voice coil linear actuator;position control loop;analog servo controller;position error;Kalman filter","","1","","29","","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, it is widely considered as one of the key elements in the higher education of process (or chemical) engineering. However, there is no general agreement on how thermodynamics should be taught. Some curricula focus on theory and scientific principles, whereas others emphasize the role of utilisation of thermodynamics in various applications. The programme of process engineering at the University of Oulu in Finland is based on a so-called DAS-formalism, in which studies proceed from descriptive studies to holistic synthesis via analysis-studies, that form the main core of the B.Sc. level curriculum. Methodological skills and knowledge (needed in R&D of process engineering) are emphasized in an attempt to bind theory with practical elements of engineering. It has been noticed that this helps to motivate also practice-oriented engineering students to study theoretical topics such as thermodynamics. Engineering courses emphasizing the methodological skills may be based on e.g. experiments, analyses or modelling. In comparison to experiments and analyses, modelling and simulation often offer an easier, safer and cheaper way to introduce methodological aspects to engineering curricula.

The aim of this study is to review and investigate the design, operations, and effects of rules reduction for FLC in IM drives. Based on the literature, the most commonly used technique to design FLC Membership Functions (MFs) rule-base and control model is based on engineering skills and experienced behavioral aspects of the controlled system. Simplified fuzzy rules approaches have been introduced to reduce the number of fuzzy rules in order to realize hardware implementation. This study discusses different simplified rules methods applied to IM drives. Most of the proposed methods shared a common drawback in that they lacked systematic procedures for designing FLC rule base. Therefore, this research proposed a methodological approach to designing and simplifying the FLC rule-base for IM drives based on dynamic step response and phase plane trajectory of the second order representation of IM drives systems. The proposed method presents guidance for designing FLC rule-base based on the general dynamic step response of the controlled system. Following the proposed method procedures, a (9, 25, 49) rules size has been designed and simplified to a (5, 7, 9) rules size. The effectiveness and accuracy of the designed rules as well as the simplified rules were verified by conducting simulation analysis of IM drives using MATLAB/Simulink environment. Step speed command performance comparisons were achieved with both standard designed and simplified rules at various speed demands. The simulation results showed that the simplified rules maintain the drive performance and produced similar behavior as the standard designed rules.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9017993","FLC;IM drives;simplified rules;rule-base;step response;phase-plane;systematic","Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Mathematical model;Control systems;Rotors;Stators;Hardware","angular velocity control;fuzzy control;fuzzy set theory;induction motor drives;knowledge based systems;machine control","controlled system;rules size;step speed command performance comparisons;drive performance;standard designed rules;high performance induction motor drives;rules reduction;IM drives systems;FLC membership function rule-base;simplified rules fuzzy logic speed controller;engineering skills;dynamic step response;phase plane trajectory;MATLAB/Simulink environment","","3","","121","CCBY","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first replicated two representative sets of perceptual learning experiments by training a shallow CNN to perform the relevant tasks. These networks qualitatively showed most of the characteristic behavior observed in perceptual learning, including the hallmark phenomena of specificity and its various manifestations in the forms of transfer or partial transfer, and learning enabling. We next analyzed the dynamics of weight modifications in the networks, identifying patterns which appeared to be instrumental for the transfer (or generalization) of learned skills from one task to another in the simulated networks.

However, this amount is spent without any consideration for the skill and luck of the player. For a casino, an unskilled player could fetch ~4× more revenue than a skilled player. This paper describes a video recognition system that is based on an extension of the Mask R-CNN model. Our system digitizes the game of blackjack by detecting cards and player bets in real time and processes decisions they took in order to create accurate player personas. Our proposed supervised learning approach consists of a specialized three-stage pipeline that takes images from two viewpoints of the casino table and does instance segmentation to generate masks on proposed regions of interests. These predicted masks along with derivative features are used to classify image attributes that are passed onto the next stage to assimilate the gameplay understanding. Our end-to-end model yields an accuracy of ∼95% for main bet detection and ∼98% for card detection in a controlled environment trained using transfer learning approach with 900 training examples. Our approach is generalizable and scalable and shows promising results in varied gaming scenarios and test data. Such granular level gathered data, helped in understanding player’s deviation from optimal strategy and thereby separate the skill of the player from the luck of the game. Our system also assesses the likelihood of card counting by correlating player’s betting pattern to the deck’s scaled count. Such a system lets casinos flag fraudulent activity and calculate expected personalized profitability for each player and tailor their marketing reinvestment decisions.","","978-1-7281-8470-8","10.1109/ICMLA51294.2020.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356141","player intelligence;instance segmentation;montecarlo simulation;blackjack;wager detection;strategy evaluation;card counting","Training;Image segmentation;Transfer learning;Supervised learning;Games;Streaming media;Real-time systems","","","","","","28","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Semiotic fusion of data from multiple sensory sources is a potential solution to the problem of landmine detection. This turns out to be significant, because notwithstanding the diversity of sensor technologies being used to attack the problem, there is no single effective landmine sensor technology. The only practical, general-purpose mine detector presently available is the trained dog. Most research into mine-detection technology seeks to emulate the dog's seemingly uncanny abilities. An ideal data-fusion system would mimic animal reaction, with the brain's perceptive power melding multiple sensory cues into an awareness of the size and location of a mine. Furthermore, the fusion process should be adaptive, with the skill at combining cues into awareness improving with experience. Electronic data-fusion systems reported in the countermine literature use conventional vector-based pattern recognition methods. Although neural nets are popular, they have never satisfactorily met the challenge. Despite years of investigation, nobody has ever found a vector space representation that reliably characterizes mine identity. This strongly suggests that the features have not been found because researchers have been looking for the wrong characteristics.

The model configuration consists of a one-way nesting of two domains with a horizontal resolution of 6-km and 2-km, respectively. CariCOOS developed a single domain configuration of the WRF NMM model having a finer horizontal spatial resolution of 1-km. These models, in general, are discrete approximations in space and time of a continuous geophysical medium being simulated. The solutions to these models are not an exact representation of reality. The goal is to keep track of the relative ability of a model to make accurate predictions. A real-time validation MATLAB® script, for numerical weather prediction (NWP), was developed to assist CariCOOS end-users in comparing the forecasts to actual data. The validation of these models was conducted by comparing in-situ wind observations (Oi), of CariCOOS observing network, with model forecast (Mi). Time histories plots of in-situ and modeled wind speed and direction are compared in real time; while also solving statistical algorithms with various validation parameters as outputs. The statistical parameters included in the real-time validation tool are: (i) the Pearson's moment correlation coefficient (r), (ii) mean bias (MB), (iii) mean absolute gross error (MAGE), (iv) root mean square error (RMSE), (v) Willmott index of agreement (IOA) and (vi) hit rate (HR). This useful real-time validation tool allows NWS WFO SJU forecasters and CariCOOS researchers to measure the skill of the model and quantify the error to determine future needs for modeling enhancements. The real-time validation framework developed facilitates CariCOOS researchers to set any validation date range, which can vary from days to months. The validation skill appraisal revealed noticeable improvement in the forecasting for both wind speed and direction by the WRF-1KM when compared to the WRF-2KM and the NWS National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) operational product. Typically the most improved locations are noticed for weather stations in regions surrounded by complex topographic features,, particularly the lee side of islands. These findings suggest that the 1-km model resolves better the local orographic forcing generated by the fine-scale topography, typical of the coastal meteorology of Caribbean islands. The improvement in forecasting 10-m winds is due to a better depiction of the 1-km resolution model of complex terrain. These findings may lead to better understanding of local convection process, which dominates the diurnal and nocturnal wind cycles of sea and land breeze, respectively.","","978-0-9339-5743-5","10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7404368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404368","WRF model;high-resolution;ioos;caricoos","Mathematical model;Wind speed;Predictive models;Numerical models;Wind forecasting;Real-time systems","approximation theory;geophysics computing;mathematics computing;statistical analysis;weather forecasting","statistical parameters;local convection process;Caribbean islands;Willmott index of agreement;RMSE;root mean square error;mean absolute gross error;Pearson's moment correlation coefficient;NWP;numerical weather prediction;discrete approximation;WRF NMM model;National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office San Juan;high-resolution wind forecast;real-time data validation;CariCOOS","","","","10","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Simple analysis of a flying capacitor converter voltage balance dynamics for DC modulation","A. Ruderman; B. Reznikov; M.

Flying capacitor converter practically does not suffer from voltage balance imposed performance limitations as opposed to multiple point clamped converter. Voltage balance dynamics analytical research methods reported to date deal mostly with an AC modulation case and are essentially based on a frequency domain analysis using double Fourier transform. Therefore, these methods require high mathematical skills, are not truly analytical and rather difficult to use in an everyday practice by electrical engineer. In this paper, we consider a DC modulation case to demonstrate that a straightforward time domain approach based on switching intervals piece-wise analytical solutions makes it easy to obtain time-averaged discrete and continuous models for voltage balance dynamics simulation. A primitive single-phase single-leg three-level converter analytical investigation yields a surprisingly simple accurate expression for capacitor charge / discharge related time constant revealing its dependence on inductive load parameters, carrier frequency, and duty ratio.","","978-1-4244-1741-4","10.1109/EPEPEMC.2008.4635276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4635276","","Converters;Capacitors;Switches;Pulse width modulation;Modulation;Load modeling;Mathematical model","power capacitors;PWM power convertors;switching convertors;time-domain analysis","flying capacitor multilevel PWM converter;voltage balance dynamics;DC modulation;AC modulation;frequency domain analysis;double Fourier transform;time domain approach;switching intervals;piecewise analytical solutions;time-averaged discrete models;continuous models;charge-discharge time constant;inductive load parameters","","38","1","8","","30 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

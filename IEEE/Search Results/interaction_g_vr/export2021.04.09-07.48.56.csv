"IP multicast fault recovery in PIM over OSPF","Xin Wang; C. Yu; H. Schulzrinne; P. Stirpe; Wei Wu","Dept. of Comput.

This paper focuses on the interactions of the component protocols to understand their behavior in network failure and recovery scenarios. We consider a multicast environment based on the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. Analytical models are presented to describe the interplay of all of these protocols in various multicast channel recovery scenarios. Quantitative results for the recovery time of IP multicast channels are given as references for network configurations, and protocol development. Simulation models are developed using the OPNET simulation tool to measure the fault recovery time and the associated protocol control overhead, and study the influence of important protocol parameters. A testbed with five Cisco routers is configured with PIM, OSPF, and IGMP to measure the multicast channel failure and recovery times for a variety of different link and router failures. In general, the failure recovery is found to be lightweight in term of control overhead and recovery time. Failure recovery time in a WAN is found to be dominated by the unicast protocol recovery process. Failure recovery in a LAN is more complex, and strongly influenced by protocol interaction and implementation specifics. Suggestion for improvement of the failure recovery time via protocol enhancements, parameter tuning, and network configuration are provided.","","0-7695-0921-5","10.1109/ICNP.2000.896297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896297","","Multicast protocols;Routing protocols;Internet;Environmental management;Analytical models;Time measurement;Testing;Lighting control;Wide area networks;Unicast","transport protocols;telecommunication network routing;system recovery;multicast communication;telecommunication channels;digital simulation;wide area networks;local area networks;computer network reliability;performance evaluation","IP multicast fault recovery;analytical models;OSPF;performance tuning;IP multicast networks;network failure;network recovery;Protocol Independent Multicast;PIM routing protocol;Internet Group Management Protocol;IGMP;Open Shortest Path First;OSPF protocol;multicast channel recovery time;IP multicast channels;network configurations;simulation models;OPNET simulation tool;fault recovery time;protocol control overhead;testbed;Cisco routers;router failures;link failures;control overhead;WAN;unicast protocol recovery;LAN;parameter tuning","","4","2","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smartphones offer such low cost and easily available human-robot interface (HRI) controlling robots with tilt gestures. However, tilt gestures are not used in the more commonly available UGV control devices, such as joystick and button based gamepads. Tilt gestures have not been studied in terms of their effectiveness for controlling UGVs. If they are effective, then the low cost and high availability of smartphones running apps such as ROS Control can make a huge change in the world of HRI and control devices for UGV for the developing world. They can be ruggedized and are low cost, and more familiar to the general populace - which are factors that can help the adoption of robotics in India. This research explores the ease of use and effectiveness in controlling a UGV by benchmarking a tilt-based HRI (on the ROS Control app) with the more established joystick and button based HRI on a gamepad. A 40-person usability study using both devices in Gazebo, a robotic simulated environment, was conducted. Performance metrics (time on task and lane deviations) were measured, to indicate effectiveness. However, the statistical analysis conducted using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test shows a significant difference in the use of both the input devices in controlling a UGV favoring the gamepad. However, most of the participants report the tilt based app as more controllable and highly usable.","","978-1-5090-5838-9","10.1109/ISPCC.2017.8269699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8269699","Unmanned ground vehicle;Human Robot Interaction;Smart-Phone App","Robots;Input devices;Usability;Task analysis;Land vehicles;Training;Mobile communication","control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;interactive devices;mobile computing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;remotely operated vehicles;smart phones;statistical analysis;user interfaces","comparative empirical usability assessment;HRI input devices;mobile robot;Unmanned Ground Vehicle;free smartphone app;human-robot interface;tilt gestures;UGV control devices;button based gamepads;ROS Control app;40-person usability study;robotic simulated environment;performance metric;Wilcoxon Signed Rank test;statistical analysis","","1","","12","","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, the American Research Corporation of Virginia (ARCOVA) is developing the Interactive Multimedia Program for Alcoholism Assessment and Counseling Training (IMPACT), a combination of audiovisual media and programmed interaction for the teaching of alcoholism management skills to physicians and nurses at both the student and professional levels.

Bots earn much more money in a virtual world than human players, and finally collapse balance and fairness of the MMORPG. At present, many techniques have been applied to detect and exterminate bots. However, they have a common problem that the technique effective in a certain MMORPG is not equally effective in other MMORPGs, thus no general method to detect bots has been established. Toward establishing such general technique, we analyze behavioral patterns of human players and bots in server-side game log data with two commonly available features characterizing users (human players and bots): location-based information (i.e., speed of players) and action frequency information (i.e., action count per fixed time slot). The main findings of our analysis are as follows: (1) The variation of the speed of bots is smaller than that of humans (i.e, the movement of bots is more efficient). However, the discriminative power of this location-based feature is not so significant in MMORPG, while it showed good performance in First Person Shooting (FPS) game. (2) Action count and battle count indicate more discriminative power than the speed feature. In particular, the action count is more robust than battle count against the size of the time slot.","1550-445X","978-0-7695-4953-8","10.1109/AINA.2013.108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531845","MMORPG;Bot detection;Data mining","Games;Feature extraction;Servers;Electronic mail;Robustness;Three-dimensional displays;Educational institutions","computer games;data analysis;data mining;human-robot interaction;virtual reality","players behavior analysis;Bots behavior analysis;MMORPG;massively multiplayer online role playing game;automatic robot software;virtual world;server-side game log data;location-based information;action frequency information;first person shooting game;FPS;data mining;bot detection","","4","","10","","17 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of human-machine robotic system to energy infrastructure is considered in the research. It allows decreasing of loads on human musculoskeletal system, increasing endurance and periods of uninterrupted operation, as well as labour productivity due to energy recuperation. It also ensures injury and occupational diseases prevention. The proposed ""human-machine"" model with links of variable length is more comfortable to user. Although a 2-D exoskeleton model is described in the paper, it can be generalized to 3-D case as well. The design of variable-length link with spring elements is proposed. It can be implemented in robotic device as a passive exoskeleton. The link consists of the following elements: two fixed-length inertial sections at the ends of the link, and the variable-length weightless section between them. The variable-length weightless section has a tension-compression spring that ensures both the link length change within the specified range and the energy recuperation when the exoskeleton user moves. The joints feature the torsion springs to recuperate energy during relative rotation of exoskeleton links. Thus, despite that the exoskeleton has a passive design; owing to the energy recuperation it provides power support to the human musculoskeletal system. This feature makes it very similar to active exoskeletons in its performance.","","978-1-7281-6951-4","10.1109/FarEastCon50210.2020.9271425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9271425","passive exoskeleton;differential equations of the motion;energy recuperation;variable-length link;torsion springs;tension-compression springs;comfort","Exoskeletons;Springs;Legged locomotion;Musculoskeletal system;Man-machine systems;Companies;Mathematical model","design engineering;diseases;handicapped aids;human-robot interaction;injuries;occupational health;occupational safety;springs (mechanical);torsion","active exoskeletons;passive design;exoskeleton links;torsion springs;exoskeleton user moves;link length change;tension-compression spring;variable-length weightless section;fixed-length inertial sections;robotic device;variable-length link;human-machine model;occupational diseases prevention;energy recuperation;human musculoskeletal system;energy infrastructure;human-machine robotic system;passive exoskeleton model;spring elements;human-machine system;motion simulation","","","","30","","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing data-flow architectures provide no generic approach to handle modules that perform complex temporal processing such as particle tracing or statistical analysis over time. Moreover, there is no solution to create and manage module data, which is associated with alternative scenarios. Our solution is based on generic data-flow algorithms to automate this process, enabling elaborate data-flow procedures, such as simulation, temporal integration or data aggregation over many time steps in many worlds. To hide the complexity from the user, we extend the World Lines interaction techniques to control the novel data-flow architecture. The concept of multiple, special-purpose cursors is introduced to let users intuitively navigate through time and alternative scenarios. Users specify only what they want to see, the decision which data are required is handled automatically. The concepts are explained by taking the example of the simulation and analysis of material transport in levee-breach scenarios.

For intelligent human-machine communication, it is essential that machines understand prosodic characteristics which imply a user's various attitude, emotion and intention beyond vocabulary. The authors' original focus is on particularly distinct pitch patterns and their roles in the actual dialogues. They used human-machine dialogues collected by a Wizard of OZ simulation. Many utterance segments belonged to clusters that were prosodically flat patterns. From the result, they considered that utterances which belonged to the other clusters and those which were far from the centroids included non-verbal information. In these utterances, there were talks to themselves and questions to the machine including emotional expressions of a puzzle or a surprise. These pitch patterns were not only rich in ups and downs, but also their slopes were upward, while the pitch patterns were generally even or a little downward. These results indicate that peculiar pitch period patterns show non-verbal expressions. In order to actually utilize such information on human-machine interactions, the representative pitch patterns should be investigated concerning their relationship to various types of communication.","","0-7803-3555-4","10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=607731","","Pattern clustering;Man machine systems;Machine intelligence;Vocabulary;Laboratories;Uninterruptible power systems;Character generation;Cities and towns;Speech synthesis;Filtering","speech recognition;natural language interfaces;speech processing;digital simulation","pitch pattern clustering;user utterances;human-machine dialogue;pitch pattern variations;intelligent human-machine communication;prosodic characteristic understanding;user attitude;user emotion;user intention;Wizard of OZ simulation;nonverbal information;emotional expressions;communication","","8","1","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Participants in our studies used a conversational interface to report information in a simulated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) task. In the task, for flexibility and ease of use, participants reported information to the conversational agent in natural language. Then, the conversational agent interpreted the user's reports in a human- and machine-readable language. Next, participants could accept or reject the agent's interpretation. Misparses occur when the agent incorrectly interprets the report and the user erroneously accepts it.

Examples of targets might include national civil and military airports, command and control systems of civil and military transportation means electronic military systems for national defense, national infrastructures for water and electricity distribution, industries and also hospitals or firefighters informatics systems. The risk of cyber attacks for the mentioned systems and infrastructures has grown because of the introduction of general-purpose and open (not proprietary)communication protocols, widely interconnecting systems and services. With this regard, it is of great importance the problem of evaluating the impact that cyber attacks could generate and to select effective countermeasures to protect military and civil heterogeneous and interconnected systems. In this paper the Mixed Holistic Reductionist (MHR) model is proposed as a conceptual methodology to evaluate the impact of a set of cyber attacks to military and civil infrastructures of strategic interest. The reductionist approach allows modeling of heterogeneous systems using the simplest elements and then coming to assess the interaction of basic components. The holistic paradigm instead allows to analyze complex systems by evaluating their behavior in complex and thus as a monolithic unit. This model allows combining the holistic method with the reductionist, trying to maintain the benefits of both paradigms. The two methods are linked together through an additional layer which is an intermediate level of abstraction, usually represented by the services of any infrastructure. Services are defined as logical objects, in order to obtain useful functionality to the customer, or other infrastructure. The validity of MHR model has been already tested within the context of Critical Infrastructure protection. In particular, it has been implemented in CISIA, a system-interdependency simulator, developed by ""Roma Tre""University. In this work, the effectiveness of the model is studied with regard to government infrastructure protection from cyber attacks and, with this regard, an explicative case study is presented.","","978-1-4673-2358-1","10.1109/EISIC.2012.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298822","cyber attacks;impact assessment;critical infrastructures","Telecommunications;Power grids;Control systems;Security;Context;Quality of service;Data models","command and control systems;computer network security;digital simulation;government;national security;protocols","mixed holistic reductionistic approach;cyber attack impact assessment;cyber-war;strategic targets;citizen security;national civil airports;military airports;command and control systems;military transportation;civil transportation;electronic military systems;national defense;national infrastructures;water distribution;electricity distribution;fire-fighters;hospitals;cyber attack risk;general-purpose communication protocols;open communication protocols;cyber attack impact evaluation;military system protection;civil system protection;heterogeneous systems;interconnected systems;MHR model validity;critical infrastructure protection;CISIA;system-interdependency simulator;Roma Tre University;government infrastructure protection;critical infrastructure simulation by interdependent agents","","5","","15","","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, speech recognition is used as an example of applying turbo processing principles to the general problem of human/machine interface. Speech recognizers frequently involve a model representing phonemic information at a local level, followed by a language model representing information at a nonlocal level. This structure is analogous to the local (e.g., equalizer) and nonlocal (e.g., error correction decoding) elements common in digital communications. Drawing from the analogy of turbo processing for digital communications, turbo speech processing iteratively feeds back the output of the language model to be used as prior probabilities for the phonemic model. This analogy is developed here, and the performance of this turbo model is characterized by using an artificial language model. Using turbo processing, the relative error rate improves significantly, especially in high-noise settings.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495711","Human–machine interface;speech processing;turbo processing","","human computer interaction;speech recognition","speech recognition;human-machine interface;human-machine interaction;digital communications;turbo speech processing;language model;phonemic model;artificial language model","Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Information Storage and Retrieval;Man-Machine Systems;Models, Statistical;Natural Language Processing;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Speech Recognition Software;Vocabulary, Controlled","1","","30","","9 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is not a general and still good and efficient enough solution for all the collaborative systems. Depending on the purpose of the collaborative work, the techniques of interaction and of manipulation change from one application to another. Despite this difference between interaction techniques, they always benefit greatly from awareness features that help in explicating implicit knowledge related to one's own and others' working activities as well as to virtual workspace. In addition, people in CVEs also use communication channels to negotiate shared understandings of task goals, of task decomposition and of task progress. Therefore, awareness and communication are usually considered as “instruments” to complete collaborative tasks in the environment. However, few research work have been devoted to improving the awareness and the communication channels in CVEs for a better collaboration between users. In this paper, we will study the importance of awareness and communication in collaborative virtual environments. We will investigate different kinds of awareness which need to be carefully designed. We will also discuss different communication means and how to cope with this diversity, so we can benefit from the availability of different peripheral devices and can find an effective communication means to work together. Finally, we will make some propositions to overcome these actual limitations of CVEs.","","978-1-4799-5217-5","10.1109/3DCVE.2014.7160928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160928","","Collaboration;Visualization;Virtual environments;Three-dimensional displays;Collaborative work;Delays;Avatars","groupware;virtual reality","collaborative virtual environments;CVE;virtual worlds;collaborative systems;collaborative work;interaction techniques;awareness features;virtual workspace;communication channels;task goals;task decomposition;task progress;collaborative tasks","","16","","31","","27 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We pose the question in this paper-How well can the head-neck be used to perform orientation tasks when compared to the hand-wrist? Anatomically, the motion of the head-neck is similar to that of the hand-wrist. We hypothesize that the head-neck motion can be as effective as the motion of the hand-wrist to control orientation tasks. A study was designed to characterize the ability of head-neck to command and control general orientation tasks. Fourteen healthy participants were asked to control the head orientation of an avatar on a computer screen using the motion of their head-neck and hand-wrist, measured by a robotic neck brace and a conventional joystick, respectively. Visual feedback was given to the participants with the display of the target and the actual head orientations of the avatar. The outcomes were defined for comparison between the head-neck and hand-wrist motions as follows: (1) mean absolute error; (2) time delay in tracking continuous orientation trajectories; and (3) settling time to reach target orientations. The results showed that the performance outcomes were significantly better with the hand-wrist than that of the head-neck when used as a joystick. However, all participants successfully completed the tasks with the head-neck. This demonstrates that the head-neck can be used as a joystick for controlling three dimensional object orientations, even though it may not be as dexterous as the hand-wrist. These results have fundamental implications in the design of devices and interfaces with the human head-neck.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2894517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624594","Head-neck motion;robotic neck brace;hand-held joystick;avatar visual feedback;human performance measurement and analysis","Avatars;Task analysis;Neck;Head;Visualization;Robots;Target tracking","avatars;human computer interaction;interactive devices","head orientation;hand-wrist motions;human head-neck;head-neck interfaces;orientation tasks;head-neck motion;joystick;hand-wrist motion;robotic neck brace;avatar;computer screen;three dimensional object orientation;mean absolute error;time delay;settling time","Adult;Feedback, Sensory;Female;Hand;Head;Head Movements;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Motion;Movement;Neck;Orientation;Psychomotor Performance;Reproducibility of Results;User-Computer Interface;Wrist","1","","24","","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An algorithm is used to calculate the distribution of the external force imposed on the grasped object in arbitrary posture, and the static grasp force of the virtual hand is regenerated according to the physically-based general force model of virtual hand grasp. Based on the theories of kinematics and dynamics, the resultant force which causes the variation in motion of the grasped object can be obtained. Further, the grasp force of the virtual hand is regenerated by combining the posture change and the resultant force. The solution has been experimentally implemented using an exoskeleton force-feedback glove. A special series of experimental results show that the static grasp force rendering approach for the virtual hand moving an object is computationally efficient while retaining a well level of realism.","","978-1-4577-1453-5","10.1109/CW.2011.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079354","haptic rendering;virtual hand;grasp force","Force;Thumb;Haptic interfaces;Mathematical model;Vectors;Rendering (computer graphics)","data gloves;force feedback;gait analysis;interactive devices;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","haptic rendering;virtual hand moving object;virtual environments;virtual reality system;authenticity;virtual object natural behavior;grasped object;posture change;external force distribution;arbitrary posture;static grasp force;physically based general force model;exoskeleton force feedback glove;static grasp force rendering approach","","1","","22","","17 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In cases of correct identification, the conventional MCE training algorithm can be used. We compare three kinds of negative adaptation algorithms for the cases of incorrect identification.

That is, instead of tedious hand-coding, a robot may learn a control policy by interacting with a teacher. In this work we present an algorithm for learning by demonstration in which the teacher operates in two phases. The teacher first demonstrates the task to the learner. The teacher next critiques learner performance of the task. This critique is used by the learner to update its control policy. In our implementation we utilize a 1-Nearest Neighbor technique which incorporates both training dataset and teacher critique. Since the teacher critiques performance only, they do not need to guess at an effective critique for the underlying algorithm. We argue that this method is particularly well-suited to human teachers, who are generally better at assigning credit to performances than to algorithms. We have applied this algorithm to the simulated task of a robot intercepting a ball.

Most existing research has tended to conflate multiple constituent factors, resulting in an inability to appropriately determine which specific factors are the cause of observed variations in learning outcomes, and an inability to reliably interpret the external validity of the research outcomes.We begin with an outline of the supporting educational theories that underpin our understanding of laboratory education. We then identify notable examples in the literature where multiple variables, such as the user interface and access modes, have been conflated into laboratory `supertypes' and are not investigated independently. These supertypes reflect the most common variable combinations: `proximal laboratory, hands-on interface', `remote laboratory, rich contextual interface', and `simulated laboratory, decontextualized interface', referred to as hands-on, remote, and simulated/virtual respectively.We then investigate the impacts of this conflation - in the context of examples, this conflation limits the generalisability of previous results and obscures potentially rewarding avenues of future research. Finally, we present methods by which research may be conducted to investigate technically simpler directions of interface decoupling, the results of which may motivate the investigation of more challenging pairings.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658725","educational;laboratory;interface;remote;virtual;simulation;research;haptic;computer-mediated;rigor","Computational modeling;Education;Haptic interfaces;Remote laboratories;Data models;Analytical models;Feeds","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;laboratories;user interfaces","laboratory supertype conflation;laboratories;learning outcomes;laboratory education;user interface;access modes;proximal laboratory;remote laboratory;simulated laboratory;decontextualized interface;interface decoupling;educational theories;hands-on interface","","","","14","","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, they are inherently difficult to achieve both high accuracy and low delay. We propose Vernier, an efficient and accurate acoustic tracking method on commodity mobile devices. In the heart of Vernier lies a novel method to efficiently and accurately derive phase change and thus moving distance. Vernier significantly reduces the tracking delay/overhead by removing the complicated frequency analysis and long window of signal accumulation, while keeping a high tracking accuracy. We implement Vernier on Android, and evaluate its performance on COTS mobile devices including Samsung Galaxy S7 and Sony L50t. Evaluation results show that Vernier outperforms previous approaches with a tracking error less than 4 mm. The tracking speed achieves 3×improvement to existing phase based approaches and 10×to Doppler Effect based approaches. Vernier is also validated in applications like controlling and drawing, and we believe it is generally applicable in many real applications.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486365","","Mobile handsets;Tracking;Acoustics;Microsoft Windows;Delays;Doppler effect;Frequency modulation","acoustic signal detection;Doppler effect;mobile computing;user interfaces;virtual reality","Vernier;acoustic motion tracking approaches;time-consuming signal processing;commodity mobile devices;signal accumulation;high tracking accuracy;COTS mobile devices;tracking error;tracking speed;phase based approaches","","7","","25","","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The generation of textual entailment (GTE) is critical to the further improvement of CSIEC project and other natural language generation program. Up to now we have found few literatures on the general algorithm for GTE. Simulating the process that a human being learns English as a foreign language, we explore our naive approach to tackle the GTE problem and its algorithm within the framework of CSIEC, i.e. rule annotation in NLML, pattern recognition and entailment transformation. The time and space complexity of our algorithm is tested with some entailment examples. An interactive command line textual entailment editor is created to generalize an entailment rule from a case pair of text and entailment. The test version of this innovative GTE approach can be accessed in the CSIEC website. Further works include the rules annotation based on the English textbooks and a GUI interface for normal users to edit the entailment rules.","","978-1-4244-4515-8","10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906806","Generation of Textual Entailment (GTE);CSIEC;Inference","Intelligent systems;Natural languages;Books;Humans;Computer simulation;Testing;Databases;Robots;Educational technology;Computer science","computer aided instruction;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;interactive systems;natural language processing","textual entailment;intelligent dialogue system;language learning;CSIEC;computer simulation in educational communication;interactive Web-based human-computer dialogue system;English instruction;natural language generation program;rules annotation;GUI interface","","9","","14","","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Maintaining concurrency in these mock-ups can be time-consuming and expensive. Over the past several years, Southwest Research Institute (SwRIreg) has worked with the United States Air Force to develop a generalized approach which uses purely virtual assets to provide training in a flexible environment in which configuration changes are made solely through software modifications. While a purely virtual approach has proven effective and flexible, it lacks the realistic interactions supported by the physical constraints present in mock-ups. This paper describes a novel approach to provide a more realistic interface while also extending the useful life of a training system which might otherwise be rendered obsolete. The technique combines virtual and real assets to provide haptic feedback. The interaction technique uses precision finger tracking combined with tactile sensors attached to the finger tip.","","978-1-4244-3965-2","10.1109/3DUI.2009.4811233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811233","","Haptic interfaces;Fingers;Light emitting diodes;Switches;Military aircraft;Force sensors;Virtual environment;Displays;Optical feedback;Sensor systems","aerospace computing;haptic interfaces;pressure sensors;tactile sensors","passive haptics;pressure sensor;training system;haptic feedback;precision finger tracking;tactile sensor","","5","","1","","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing circuit diagram simulation tools are mostly based on GUI interface and rely on users to click or drag icons with mouse, which requires them to be familiar with the software and distracts a great deal of their attention from the circuit diagram itself. Although a lot of previous works have devoted to designing algorithmic solution to recognize hand-drawn circuit diagrams automatically, there still exists strict constraints on users' drawing habits and stroke orders. In order to address these inconveniences, this paper proposes a novel sketch recognition algorithm named LS4D. It uses graph to model the input strokes and their relationships, and leverages cycles by local strokes to detect some circuit components. Theoretical derivations have demonstrated that LS4D can efficiently recognize diagrams with different drawing styles and arbitrary stroke orders. To furthermore illustrate the practical value of the proposed approach, we construct a prototype of pen-based circuit diagram system based on LS4D , which enables users to draw circuit diagrams directly on the digital screen without any other restriction. An experiment of 158 samples collected from 17 users is conducted on the designed platform. Our approach has achieved 93.04% recognition accuracy and overall 4.53 from a 5-scale user satisfaction rating, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods numerically. It is shown that the same approach can also be generalized to many other sketch recognition applications with minor modifications.

However, public gesture datasets are captured in the daily environment and existing approaches trained on these datasets achieve imprecise performance for astronaut gesture recognition. In this paper, we introduce a new astronaut gesture dataset (DSSL-Astronaut gesture dataset) and a novel hierarchical attention single-shot detector network (HA-SSD) for astronaut gesture recognition. Specifically, this dataset consists of the real and augmented images. The real images captured in the simulated space station are closed to the real images in the space station environment. Meanwhile, we utilize the Mask-RCNN model to segment the foreground image including an astronaut from real data and capture the background images of the simulated space station at different views and illuminations. Then we combine them to synthesize the augmented images. A novel HA-SSD model consists of a lightweight backbone named MobileNet and a hierarchical attention mechanism. The MobileNet is used as the feature extractor, which contains several depth-wise separable convolutions to make a trade-off between latency and accuracy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical channel-wise attention module is adopted to exploit the fine semantic information to enrich the features for improving the performance of gesture recognition. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our dataset is suitable for the space station and our approach is able to effectively localize and recognize the gestures with strong generality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986473","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060947","Assist robot;attention;gesture dataset;gesture recognition;single-shot detector","Gesture recognition;Space stations;Detectors;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems","aerospace computing;aerospace robotics;control engineering computing;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;image segmentation","visual gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;augmented images;simulated space station;foreground image;background images;hierarchical channel-wise attention module;hierarchical attention-based astronaut gesture recognition;DSSL-astronaut gesture dataset;hierarchical attention single-shot detector network;HA-SSD model;MobileNet","","","","50","CCBY","8 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to evaluate that behavior, we performed a user study to develop navigational algorithms that minimize emotional reactions. This study establishes a mapping between emotional reactions and multi-robot trajectories and appearances and further generalizes the finding across various environmental conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach for trajectory computation for active navigation and dynamic intervention in simulated autonomous robot-human interaction scenarios.

The procedure combines learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning: a robot first imitates a demonstrator's execution of the task and then learns contextualized variants of the demonstrated action through experience. We use dynamic movement primitives as compact motion representations, and a model-based C-REPS algorithm for learning policies that can specify hand-over position, conditioned on context variables. Policies are learned using simulated task executions, before transferring them to the robot and evaluating emergent behaviours. We additionally conduct a user study involving participants assuming different postures and receiving an object from a robot, which executes hand-overs by either imitating a demonstrated motion, or adapting its motion to hand-over positions suggested by the learned policy. The results confirm the hypothesized improvements in the robot's perceived behaviour when it is context-aware and adaptive, and provide useful insights that can inform future developments.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197476","","Robots;Task analysis;Trajectory;Context modeling;Encoding;Adaptation models;Learning (artificial intelligence)","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);service robots;ubiquitous computing","demonstrated motion;learned policy;perceived behaviour;context-aware task execution;apprenticeship learning;assistive service robots;human-oriented tasks;task parameters;optimal behaviour;robot-to-human object hand-over;reinforcement learning;demonstrator;contextualized variants;demonstrated action;dynamic movement primitives;compact motion representations;model-based C-REPS algorithm;hand-over position;context variables;simulated task executions;evaluating emergent behaviours;context-aware action generalization","","","","35","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many user interface (UI) patterns are well suited to identifying UI knowledge to strengthen reuse. Some UI pattern tools provide simulation capabilities and/or aid in the construction of concrete user interfaces. When it is desirable for the simulated or constructed interface to be realistic, different implementation architectures need to be built for every pattern because of lack of the uniform implementation mechanism, which has effect on the capability of UI knowledge reuse thoroughly. After the granularity of above patterns are shortened, a uniform UI pattern architecture (UUIPA) is proposed towards the engineering UI development. The architecture is based on MVC architecture which contains the interior data, the behavior control and presentation control. The three aspects come from Interaction Object (IO) extended from General Object in the conceptual model to Presentation Style (PS) used frequently by designers in the implementation model, which embodies the map relation from IO to PS. Through the visible customization, UI patterns are instantiate as various UI units meet needs of users. Additionally, the approach is also used to multi-device user interface development through extending PSs fitted to different devices gradually while keeping fixed IOs.

Momentum-based controllers (MBC) have been successfully applied in bipeds, however, it is unknown to what degree they are able to mimic human balance responses. In this paper, we investigated the ability of an MBC to generate human-like balance recovery strategies during stance, and compared the results to those obtained with a linear full-state feedback (FSF) law. We used experimental data consisting of balance recovery responses of nine healthy subjects to anteroposterior platform translations of three different amplitudes. The MBC was not able to mimic the combination of trunk, thigh and shank angle trajectories that humans generated to recover from a perturbation. Compared to the FSF, the MBC was better at tracking thigh angles and worse at tracking trunk angles, whereas both controllers performed similarly in tracking shank angles. Although the MBC predicted stable balance responses, the human-likeness of the simulated responses generally decreased with an increased perturbation magnitude. Specifically, the shifts from ankle to hip strategy generated by the MBC were not similar to the ones observed in the human data. Although the MBC was not superior to the FSF in predicting human-like balance, we consider the MBC to be more suitable for implementation in exoskeletons, because of its ability to handle constraints (e.g. ankle torque limits). Additionally, more research into the control of angular momentum and the implementation of constraints could eventually result in the generation of more human-like balance recovery strategies by the MBC.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3005455","Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the research program Wearable Robotics; EU Research Program FP7-ICT-2013-10 through the SYMBITRON project; COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127521","Balance;control;exoskeleton;human-robot interaction","Perturbation methods;Robots;Acceleration;Exoskeletons;Hip;Thigh;Computational modeling","humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;legged locomotion;linear systems;motion control;state feedback;wearable robots","balance controllers;human robot interaction;momentum based controllers;human balance responses;trunk angle tracking;thigh angle tracking;linear full state feedback law;human balance recovery prediction;wearable exoskeletons;bipedal robots","","","","41","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These QoS requirements are usually defined by the application designer. When applications with such QoS requirements are being deployed on a network of servers, an appropriate set of servers capable of satisfying the QoS constraints of the interactions must be identified.

Indeed, depending on the situation of interaction and the user himself, the robot behavior should adjust, and therefore can be judged, differently. From interaction traces (including robot actions and users' feedback), we aim to extract adaptation rules that give the dependencies between certain attributes of the interaction situation and/or the user profile, and the level of user satisfaction. We propose two learning algorithms to learn these adaptation rules. The first algorithm is direct, certain and optimal but slow to converge. The second is able to detect the importance of certain attributes in the adaptation process. It generalizes adaptation rules on unknown situations and to first time users, which makes it an approach with risk.

To improve forecasting performance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employing bootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods. Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance, which provides approximated correlations between players, which we leverage to develop a novel correlated utility learning framework. We apply the proposed methods both to a toy example arising from Bertrand-Nash competition between two firms and to data from a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavior among smart building occupants.

The first step in designing an interface for a particular application is to determine information content that needs to be displayed. The design methodology for this step is called the interface design framework (called framework ). Several frameworks have been proposed for applications at varying levels, including process plants. However, none is based on the design and manufacture of a plant system for which the interface is designed. This paper presents an interface design framework which originates from design theory and methodology for general technical systems. Specifically, the framework is based on a set of core concepts of a function-behavior-state model originally proposed by the artificial intelligence research community and widely applied in the design research community. Benefits of this new framework include the provision of a model-based fault diagnosis facility, and the seamless integration of the design (manufacture, maintenance) of plants and the design of human-machine interfaces. The missing linkage between design and operation of a plant was one of the causes of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor incident. A simulated plant system is presented to explain how to apply this framework in designing an interface. The resulting human-machine interface is discussed; specifically, several fault diagnosis examples are elaborated to demonstrate how this interface could support operators' fault diagnosis in an unanticipated situation.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2004.842728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1417187","Design;framework;function-behavior-state model;human–machine interface;nuclear power plants","Power generation;Fault diagnosis;Power engineering and energy;Magnetic force microscopy;Design engineering;Design methodology;Research and development;Artificial intelligence;Virtual manufacturing;Couplings","nuclear power stations;human computer interaction;user interfaces;fission reactor monitoring;fission reactor safety;fission reactor design;fission reactor theory;artificial intelligence;nuclear reactor maintenance;nuclear engineering computing","function-behavior-state approach;human-machine interface design;nuclear power plant operators;control room operators;plant system manufacture;general technical systems;artificial intelligence research community;design research community;model-based fault diagnosis;seamless integration;plant maintenance;missing linkage;Three Mile Island nuclear reactor incident;simulated plant system","","9","","24","","11 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The EOG signals of five test subjects were recorded while the subjects moved their eyes to view, and then fixate on, specific target points. The target points were effectively located on the shell of a sphere of known radius. Each target point was at a known vertical angle, and known transverse angle from the orthogonal planes that dissect the test subjects eyes in the horizontal plane and the test subjects nose in the vertical plane. The experiments were repeated for determining the EOG relationship for vertical eye movement. The results obtained are encouraging. The assessment of the data suggests that EOG can be successfully utilised for spatial control applications within some limitations.

This has extended to conceptions of individual characteristics or predispositions to trust, which have generally been defined in terms very similar to the construct they are intended to explain; so, for example, predisposition to trust is defined as tendency to be trusting in the situation. The result is an explanation of trust that is quite similar to the construct itself. In this study we advance a basic theory of personality, circumplex theory, as an explanation for trust in anticipated virtual collaborations among medical care professionals. Circumplex theory fits well with existing models of trust because it predicts interpersonal interaction styles, but it offers an explanation grounded in a broad theory of personality that promises to offer more insight than do existing trait explanations of trust. We develop a model based on circumplex theory to predict trust and willingness to participate in anticipated virtual collaborations in telemedicine. The model is tested with a survey administered to physical rehabilitation professionals in a large telemedicine network. Implications for telemedicine and for research on virtual trust are discussed.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265374","","Collaboration;Telemedicine;Testing;Information management;Cities and towns;Medical services;Smelting;Predictive models;Shape;Urban areas","telemedicine;health care;professional aspects;virtual reality;behavioural sciences computing","trait theory;telemedicine;personality traits;virtual collaboration;circumplex theory;medical care professionals;interpersonal interaction styles;physical rehabilitation professionals","","4","","28","","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores the application of EEG-measured error-related potentials (ErrPs) to closed-loop robotic control. ErrP signals are particularly useful for robotics tasks because they are naturally occurring within the brain in response to an unexpected error. We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classification performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for realtime closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as offline analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened. This work thereby demonstrates the potential for EEG-based feedback methods to facilitate seamless robotic control, and moves closer towards the goal of real-time intuitive interaction.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989777","","Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Collaboration;Training;Visualization;Mobile robots","closed loop systems;dexterous manipulators;electroencephalography;feedback;human-robot interaction;open loop systems","brain activity;feedback loop;intuitive interaction tasks;EEG-measured error-related potentials;EEG-measured ErrP;closed-loop robotic control;ErrP signal decoding;Rethink Robotics Baxter robot;binary object selection task;secondary interactive error-related potential signal;closed-loop robot task;classification performance improvement;human feedback;real- time closed-loop experiments;real-time open-loop experiments;offline analysis;primary ErrP signals;secondary ErrP signals;EEG-based feedback methods","","32","","19","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The beam is divided into a set of discrete rays, or ""beamlets"", instead of the disks or rings used in one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) models. The RF fields supported by the helix are represented by a tape helix model that uses a modal expansion including the full (Bessel function) radial dependence of the fields; both forward and backward synchronous space harmonics are included in the model. RF space charge fields are obtained from solutions of the Helmholtz equations for the RF electric and RF magnetic fields, using the beam current and charge densities as sources. The dc space charge electric field is similarly obtained from a solution of Poisson's equation. This model has been implemented in a code called CHRISTINE 3D, a generalization of the one dimensional CHRISTINE code. The full three dimensional treatment permits the accurate computation of large signal gain and efficiency, taking into account the self-consistent variation of beam radius along the interaction space. The code also computes helix interception current and transverse beam distributions at the entrance to the collector-important design data that are unavailable from a 1D model. Results from the CHRISTINE 3D code are shown to compare very favorably with measurements of output power, efficiency, and interception current vs. drive power. Its predictions for spent beam distributions also compare very well with measurements. Run times for the code are problem dependent, but for a single case of interest are typically 1 to 5 min on a 450 MHz PC, orders of magnitude shorter than that required for a comparable 3D particle-in-cell simulation.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.892161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892161","","Helical waveguides","helical waveguides;travelling wave tubes;Bessel functions;harmonics;Helmholtz equations;space charge;Poisson equation;digital simulation","three-dimensional multifrequency large signal model;helix traveling wave tubes;beam wave interaction;beamlets;tape helix model;modal expansion;Bessel function;synchronous space harmonics;Helmholtz equations;charge densities;dc space charge electric field;Poisson's equation;CHRISTINE 3D;large signal gain;self-consistent variation;helix interception current;transverse beam distributions;interception current;output power;spent beam distributions","","95","","20","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the present day there are a number of complex, albeit expensive instruments that can measure various parameters accurately. However, these instruments often tend to be bulky, expensive and difficult to operate. Hence it is difficult to use these instruments in isolated locations such as rural or disaster stricken areas, for bedside monitoring or even in military camps. The objective of this paper is to introduce the concept of a user friendly modular system which can be used to monitor various physiological parameters efficiently. In the proposed system different sensing circuits are attached to a common MicroController Unit (MCU) which can be updated with the associated firmware. Any general computing system such as a laptop is connected to the MCU via a USB-UART bridge. After the connection is established the controller starts sending data to the computer. A JavaScript is run on the laptop using open-source software called Processing 2.0, which initiates a customized display of the various parameters using the incoming data. For data logging we store the serial data in text files. As proof of principle we have measured two parameters, namely the body temperature using the LM35 sensor and the heart rate using photoplethysmography. Such a switchable system can be used as a tool to measure various parameters like oxygen saturation, blood pressure, ECG etc. on the computer screen.","","978-1-5090-0849-0","10.1109/CASP.2016.7746154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7746154","Photoplethysmography;Operational amplifier;Low pass filter;High Pass Filter;JavaScript;modular;temperature measurement;heart rate measurement","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Heart rate;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Portable computers","blood pressure measurement;computer displays;electrocardiography;firmware;human computer interaction;Java;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;oximetry;patient monitoring;photoplethysmography;portable instruments;public domain software","portable system;vital sign monitoring;Java based computer display;data logging;photoplethysmography;oxygen saturation;blood pressure;ECG;computer screen;heart rate;LM35 sensor;body temperature;text files;serial data;customized display;Processing 2.0;open-source software;JavaScript;data sending;USB-UART bridge;laptop;general computing system;associated firmware;microcontroller unit;sensing circuits;physiological parameters;user friendly modular system;military camps;bedside monitoring;disaster stricken areas;rural stricken areas;complex albeit expensive instruments;public health","","","","16","","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation of the model not only reproduces the process of a monocentric city's formation, but discovers that in a double-centered city's construction, administrative interference should be combined with the city's self-organizing evolution at a proper time.

Compared to this Legacy HMI, the new AP HMI provides enhanced information architecture, simplified graphics and navigation, as well as improved alarm management allowing operators and plant maintenance personnel to focus on what is important. Nine operations staff from a power plant in France performed simulated tasks using both Legacy HMI as a baseline and AP HMI. We measured their performance and satisfaction on the use of HMI to quantify the enhanced effectiveness of AP HMI. AP HMI resulted in 33% higher success rate, 79% lower navigation time, 42% lower total time on task compared to Legacy HMI.

These types of applications that include 3D games, virtual life simulations, educational environments, museums, etc. are already considered by many as the new generation of human computer interface and human computer mediated communication; they continue to grow in size and integrate or even replace traditional ones (web browsers, instant messengers, social portals, etc.). The main problems of current 3D MMO server architectures are related to their scalability because they need to accommodate a large number of concurrent users and the number of operations that need to be executed can get very high in moments of peak usage. These problems of scalability are mainly due to the necessity to achieve real time low latency interaction in the 3D virtual worlds, at the same time ensuring their consistency and persistence. The owners of such virtual worlds need to handle a high operational cost due to the software and hardware complexity of current server architectures. In this paper we present and evaluate the 3D MMO server architectures already used in production and we also expand our previous work, presenting an overview of a solution that uses GPGPU (General Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units) processing in order to alleviate the scalability and costs of current architectures.

Mobile robots can be considered as a particular example of telemanipulation systems, since they can be operated remotely to perform particular tasks. As an example, the inspection of underwater structures and the removal of mines are performed by mobile platforms controlled by a remote operator, which generally takes advantage only of the visual feedback provided by vision systems. In this sense, the nature and completeness of the data provided to the operator about the state of the remote system are of crucial importance for proper task execution, and it is generally accepted that a more efficient achievement of the task can be obtained by increasing the amount of data feedback and using proper MMI. In this paper, the use of a haptic interface is proposed in order to increase a user's perception of the workspace of a mobile robot. In particular, a virtual interaction force is computed on the basis of obstacles surrounding the mobile vehicle in order to prevent dangerous contacts, so that navigation tasks can be carried out with generally better performances. In addition, passivity of the overall system is taken into account, so that stability of the virtual interaction is guaranteed.","","0-7803-7635-8","10.1109/HAVE.2002.1106916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106916","","Mobile robots;Haptic interfaces;Humans;Inspection;Underwater structures;Control systems;Machine vision;State feedback;Mobile computing;Vehicles","mobile robots;telerobotics;haptic interfaces;force feedback;virtual reality","teleoperation;mobile robots;telemanipulation systems;underwater structure inspection;mine removal;haptic feedback;remote system;data feedback;workspace perception;virtual interaction force;obstacles;navigation tasks;stability","","68","","11","","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, a depth camera-based human motion teaching has been developed. However, inverse kinematic analysis using human motion skeletal data obtained from the depth camera is not general but rather robot structure-dependent. Thus, in this paper, we present a more general approach to compute joint angles from the skeletal data obtained from a depth camera using a recursive inverse kinematic algorithm. With a known base body orientation, each joint angle is recursively computed from the base body (torso) to the tree end body (robot hand). To validate the proposed recursive inverse kinematic algorithm, simulations of a humanoid robot model have been carried out using the RecurDyn multibody analysis software. The virtual humanoid robot consists of two 6 DOF arms and a 2DOF waist. The human upper body motion when walking has been captured using a Microsoft Azure Kinect depth camera. The hand motion from the depth camera and that from the simulation have been compared to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2642-3901","978-89-93215-20-5","10.23919/ICCAS50221.2020.9268277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268277","Humanoid Robot;Recursive Inverse Kinematics;Depth Camera;Skeleton Tracking;Robot Teaching","Robots;Humanoid robots;Kinematics;Education;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Skeleton","humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;manipulator kinematics;mobile robots;motion control;robot vision","robot hand;humanoid robot model;virtual humanoid robot;human upper body motion;Microsoft Azure Kinect depth camera;hand motion;recursive inverse kinematics analysis;humanoid social robot;depth camera-based human motion teaching;inverse kinematic analysis;human motion skeletal data;robot structure-dependent;joint angle;known base body orientation;tree end body;human motion teaching;RecurDyn multibody analysis software;6 DOF arms;2DOF waist","","","","14","","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Designing interface for girls: Looking at the ‘form’ and ‘content’ factors in a comic container","Z.

This is because girls are harder to engage and motivate than boys. Given a game, boys rush to beat the game. Girls? The challenges are bigger because of their characteristics of being more reserved, taking their own sweet time to explore. For the reasons, more than ever, girls' preferences and needs are less addressed. This study examines girls' preferences in terms of a user interface's form and content. In terms of form, i. e. the physical appearance attributes such as layout, contrast, balance, screen objects and other associated display elements of the interface are examined. A sample content of girls' type comic is used as the domain for analysis. The comic is given a persona name iCOMIC: Fatihah. The content was created based on 25 girls experience and their affective values. Their life stories were combined, mixed and recreated in an attempt to indirectly teach girls about moral, ethical and cultural knowledge. In this study we assume that the display's characteristics are dominant in adding interest towards `learning'. Using 12 randomly selected girls of age 7 till 19 as our subjects, we studied their preferences towards the interface design using Cooper's primary pesona design. The preferences are analysed and translated into the iCOMIC interface, as an implication of the study. The study found out that there are significant deviations from the HCI general rule in terms of a user interface's form design for girls. With such interface, one of the most important HCI research agenda is addressed, i. e. to provide techniques for information understanding.","","978-1-4577-1655-3","10.1109/iUSEr.2011.6150532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150532","interface for girls;form and content;comic;comic interface;persona enquiry","Games;Prototypes;Software;Educational institutions;Layout;Containers;Cultural differences","cultural aspects;design engineering;ethical aspects;gender issues;human computer interaction;user interfaces","interface design;user interface content factors;comic container;educational games;leisure applications;girl preferences;girl need;user interface form;physical appearance attributes;layout;contrast;balance;screen objects;iCOMIC;Fatihah;moral knowledge;ethical knowledge;cultural knowledge;display characteristics;Cooper primary pesona design;HCI;information understanding","","4","","13","","13 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, game-based learning using LEGO block building is applied to improve the descriptively verbal skill. The special model, such as a half bird-half dinosaur creature or something that is not a general object, is used as the prototype model. All members of each team cannot see this model except the team leader which will describe the model information to two sub-leaders one by one. The model information will be divided into two parts for each sub-leader which will carry this information to the members of each subgroup. Finally, the finished 3D figure from all teams will be compared with the prototype model. Results show that most of them quite similar to the prototype. However, allowing the opportunity to talk with the team leader again can increase the similarity of the model.

Based on the relationship of objects, the embedded aesthetic criterion, the design criterion for proper placement and human movement in a scene, we design five energy functions, the overlap constraint, pairwise constraint, wall constraint, aisle constraint, angle constraint and penalty item, are proposed. We use a multi-object particle swarm intelligence optimization method with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to solve this optimization problem and obtain a Pareto-optimal solution. 3D gestures are used as the medium of interaction between the user and the system. Our method significantly enhances the existing weighted energy optimization method by allowing a joint optimization of various energy functions. The experiments confirm that all the energy functions can converge at the same time and that the proposed method obtains results superior to those of the weighted methods.

This places a burden on the human teammate to extensively communicate explicitly what goals they are pursuing and how they are pursuing them. To improve the AIAs ability to coordinate, we have proposed Operationalized Intent as a means to explicitly model how an operator qualitatively desires a task to be performed. In this paper, we report the results of a study to track operator intent through a tactical scenario. The focus of this paper is on the dynamics of intent and it's cohesiveness across operators. The study employed an immersive, advanced research, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) simulator to study intent in a synthetic task environment. Using operational pilots and sensor operators in realistic scenarios we were able to elicit their intent under naturalistic conditions in the midst of challenging tactical situations to study the real-time dynamics. Analysis indicates that the method models intent which is dynamically responsive to changes in the situation and the data are suitably cohesive across operators to generalize to an operator role. When the intent data is coupled to situated data from the simulator it provides a labeled data source for future AIAs to estimate intent in real-time.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9283017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283017","Human-Machine Cooperation and Systems;Mental Models;Augmented Cognition","Conferences;Real-time systems;Data models;Intelligent agents;Task analysis;Man-machine systems;Cybernetics","human computer interaction;military computing;software agents","operator intent;tactical operations;human-agent teams;artificial intelligent agents;AIA;operationalized intent;tactical scenario;remotely piloted aircraft simulator;operational pilots;sensor operators;tactical situations;RPA simulator","","","","14","","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While we focus on the use of context to draw up photographic history, the vision behind Reminisce is more general. We describe how Reminisce is built on a contextual database middleware that provides context storage and context-sensitive queries that determine the similarity between pairs of contexts. Reminisce uses the contextual database to store the contexts of a user's photos, which include location, time, neighboring devices, and weather conditions. Later, the app identifies the photos whose stored contexts are most similar to the user's current context by querying the contextual database; this query uses a context similarity function to compare entries in the database to the user's current context.

However, few do this in a way which seamlessly generalizes to new environments where no prior observations of pedestrians are available. In this letter, we propose a novel method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict local statistics about the direction of likely human motion. Specifically, the network takes crops of a floor plan as an input and computes a cell-wise probability distributions over directions conditioned on the direction in the last time step. These environment-aware motion models can be used to improve the performance of existing tracking algorithms. We evaluated our approach with two different existing trackers, a discrete, grid-based filter as well as a particle filter and show that using our proposed method as motion model considerably improves prediction quality in previously unseen test environments.

The global congruency test is more widely accepted. However, a rigorous algorithm of global congruency test is not easy to use and its simplified form is often used in practice. Of course, such simplified algorithm is not rigorous and does not give optimal results. This paper presents a rigorous and, at the same time, a user-friendly algorithm.

Existing navigational techniques require the partitioning of the workspace into a region of manipulation and a separate region for navigation tasks. These techniques, however, have neglected to describe an effective way to implement these concepts in a device specific manner. We propose a two step technique to define these regions based on the mechanical properties of pre-existing devices. In the first step, the kinematic properties of the device are analyzed across the entirety of the physical workspace. A well-behaved region that favours isotropic mapping from the joint actuators to the generalized forces at the end effector is selected. Having ensured high force fidelity within this region, we then perform a second step analyzing the device dynamic properties. We further subdivide the navigational space into a region with suitable inertial properties in which manipulation tasks may be performed. This procedure generates a haptic display with a highly transparent haptic manipulation region within which a user can interact with a virtual environment. This manipulation region is bounded by a well-behaved navigational region that ensures adequate force transmission. To demonstrate this technique, navigation and manipulation spaces are generated and described for the planar and spatial cases.","1050-4729","978-1-4799-6923-4","10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139711","","Navigation;Kinematics;Virtual environments;Haptic interfaces;Force;Avatars;Dynamics","end effectors;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;manipulator kinematics;virtual reality","haptic workspace;virtual environments;navigational technique;kinematic properties;physical workspace;isotropic mapping;joint actuator;end effector;device dynamic property;inertial properties;haptic display;transparent haptic manipulation region;navigational region;force transmission;manipulation space;navigation space","","1","","21","","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this program the human behavior in controlling a dynamic process is represented by a set of production rules. The selection of appropriate production rules for a given situation is performed by ordering the rules for specific tasks and by a control mechanism. The latter provides a means to access only a small part of the knowledge base at a time in order to derive decisions as opposed to searching the whole knowledge base. This program was applied to model human-problem solving in a process control task. Results from comparing model and subject behavior are presented and discussed.","2168-2909","","10.1109/TSMC.1980.4308517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4308517","","Humans;Problem-solving;Fault diagnosis;Time measurement;Circuit testing;Fuzzy sets;Electronic equipment testing;Design methodology;Automobiles;Aircraft","digital simulation;human factors;man-machine systems","man machine interactions;digital simulation;rule-based model;human problem solving;dynamic environments;engineering systems;production rules;knowledge base;process control task","","14","","22","","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design and development of these instruments requires an environment that can produce a microwave or millimeter-wave optics design, and can assess sensitivity of key design criteria (beamwidth, gain, sidelobe levels, etc.) to thermal and mechanical operating environments. An integrated design tool has been developed to carry out the design and analysis using software building blocks from the computer-aided design, thermal, structural and electromagnetic analysis fields. The capability to simultaneously assess the effects of design parameter variation resulting from thermal and structural loads can reduce design and validation cost and generally lead to more optimal designs, hence higher performing instruments. In this paper the development and application of MODTool (Millimeter-wave Optics Design), a design tool that efficiently integrates existing millimeter-wave optics design software with a solid body modeler and with thermal and structural analysis packages is discussed. The design tool is also directly useful over other portions of the spectrum, though thermal or dynamic loads may have less influence on antenna patterns at the longer wavelengths. Under a common interface, interactions between the various components of a design can be efficiently evaluated and optimized. One key component is the use of physical optics analysis software for antenna pattern analysis.","","0-7803-6599-2","10.1109/AERO.2001.931271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931271","","Optical design;Physical optics;Instruments;Optical sensors;Electromagnetic analysis;Software tools;Thermal loading;Integrated optics;Pattern analysis;Laboratories","millimetre wave antennas;software packages;electrical engineering computing;CAD;antenna radiation patterns;antenna theory;computer aided analysis;solid modelling;engineering graphics;physical optics;geometrical optics;digital simulation","integrated design tool;simulation;MM-wave antenna systems;computer-aided design;electromagnetic analysis;design parameter variation;thermal loads;structural loads;MODTool design tool;MM-wave optics design software;solid body modeler;thermal analysis packages;structural analysis packages;antenna pattern analysis;common interface;physical optics analysis software;electrically large designs;EHF;CAD;EM analysis","","1","","5","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is suited for multi-domain modeling, e.g., for modeling of mechatronics including cars, aircraft and industrial robots which typically consist of mechanical, electrical and hydraulic subsystems as well as control systems. General equations are used for modeling of the physical phenomena. No particular variable needs to be solved manually, the Modelica tools have enough information to do that automatically. The language has been designed to allow tools to generate efficient code automatically. The modeling effort is thus reduced considerably since model components can be reused and tedious and error-prone manual manipulations are not needed. The principles of object-oriented modeling and the details of the Modelica language as well as several examples are presented.","","0-7803-5500-8","10.1109/CACSD.1999.808720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=808720","","Visualization;Object oriented modeling;Mechatronics;Aircraft;Aerospace control;Aerospace industry;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control;Service robots;Robotics and automation","mechatronics;digital simulation;object-oriented languages;large-scale systems","Modelica;object-oriented language;multiple domain modeling;complex systems;heterogeneous physical systems;mechatronics","","45","2","24","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a unique strategy to model the contact torques applied to the rigid body and the resulted shape deformation of the elastic object. This strategy extends the general paradigm of contact and deformable modeling introduced by the authors earlier [1] so that not only contact forces but also contact torques, not only compliant translations but also compliant rotations of the rigid body, as well as the resulted deformations of the elastic object can all be simulated in a combined update rate of over lfeHz.

We developed a system that allow users to visualize, manipulate and edit a 3D scene projected onto a paper sheet. Using multitouch and tangible interfaces, users can directly interact with the 3D scene to prepare their drawings. Then, thanks to the projection of the 3D scene directly on the final surface medium, they can draw using standard tools while relying on the underlying 3D scene. Hence, users benefit from both the power of interactive 3D graphics and fast and easy interaction metaphors, while keeping a direct link with the physical material. PapARt has been tested during a large scale exhibition for general public. Such an interface, which combines computer-assisted drawing and free form user expressiveness on a standard sheet of paper, opens new perspectives for enhancing user creation.","","978-1-4673-1205-9","10.1109/3DUI.2012.6184167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184167","H.5.1 [Information interfaces and presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems — Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities;J.5 [Computer Applications]: Arts and humanities — fine arts","Three dimensional displays;Cameras;Art;Painting;Rabbits;Rendering (computer graphics);User interfaces","art;augmented reality;data visualisation;solid modelling;user interfaces","PapARt interface;interactive 3D graphics;multitouch augmented paper;artistic creation;pen-and-paper creation;computer graphics tool;3D scene visualization;3D scene manipulation;3D scene editing;multitouch interface;tangible interface;surface medium;interaction metaphor;computer-assisted drawing;user expressiveness","","14","","17","","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Relying on visual, audio and haptic cues, it is a difficult skill to master and with the availability of various new diagnostic techniques, the emphasis on cardiac auscultation is decreasing in both education and practice settings. Traditional cardiac auscultation training is focused on memorizing various heart sounds and their corresponding diagnosis. Recent hardware and computational advancements are providing the opportunity to develop virtual-based medical simulations that employ a high level of fidelity and novel user-simulation interaction techniques using off-the-shelf consumer-level hardware and devices. However, these virtual applications are generally restricted to cognitive skills training given that the simulation of accurate haptic cues required to replicate the sense of touch (an important component of many medical procedures including cardiac auscultation), is still difficult and cost-prohibitive. Although several low fidelity and low-cost gaming-based haptic devices are currently available, they are generally restrictive and cannot provide the range of motions (degrees of freedom) required to simulate many medical procedures. Here we describe an approach to add rotational degrees of freedom to the Novint Falcon, a consumer level (gaming) haptics device, by coupling a smartphone and incorporating the smartphone's accelerometer data to the haptics virtual controller. Our goal is to overcome the limitations associated with the limited degrees of freedom available on consumer level haptic devices and permit their use in medical technical skills-based simulation training with an affordable approach.","","978-1-5090-3429-1","10.1109/IISA.2016.7785431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785431","","Haptic interfaces;Training;Solid modeling;Medical diagnostic imaging;Visualization;Games;Surgery","accelerometers;cardiology;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;patient diagnosis;smart phones","low-end haptic device;rotational DOF;virtual cardiac auscultation training;heart sounds;virtual-based medical simulations;user-simulation interaction techniques;low-cost gaming-based haptic devices;medical procedures;smartphone accelerometer data;haptics virtual controller;consumer level haptic devices","","1","","28","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The introduction of voice to interact with personal computers as the principal method of interaction was thus indispensable. Voice User Interface (VUI) is such an interfacing mechanism that makes use of auditory information (speech) provided by the user to interact with a computer. While proposing an architecture for a Voice User Interface we also propose a framework that can be used by a general VUI to integrate with the underlying Operating System.

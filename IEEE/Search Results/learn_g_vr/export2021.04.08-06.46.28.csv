The structure of the controller consists of two models that describe the kinematics and dynamics of the mobile robot system and a feedforward neural controller. The models are modified Elman neural network and feedforward multi-layer perceptron respectively. The trained Elman neural model acts as the position and orientation identifier. The feedforward neural controller is trained off-line and adaptive weights are adapted on-line to find the reference torques, which controls the steady-state outputs of the mobile robot system. The feedback neural controller is based on the posture neural identifier and quadratic performance index optimisation algorithm to find the optimal torque action in the transient state for N-step-ahead prediction. General back propagation algorithm is used to learn the feedforward neural controller and the posture neural identifier. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive neural predictive control algorithm; this is demonstrated by the minimised tracking error and the smoothness of the torque control signal obtained with bounded external disturbances.","","978-1-4673-1690-3","10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356678","","Instruments;Automation","adaptive control;backpropagation;mobile robots;multilayer perceptrons;neurocontrollers;predictive control;robot dynamics;robot kinematics;torque control","neural autopilot predictive controller;nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot;pre-assigned posture identifier;adaptive neural predictive controller;continuous gradients trajectory tracking;noncontinuous gradients trajectory tracking;feedforward neural controller;modified Elman neural network;feedforward multilayer perceptron;reference torques;steady-state outputs;posture neural identifier;quadratic performance index optimisation algorithm;optimal torque action;N-step-ahead prediction;general back propagation algorithm;torque control signal;bounded external disturbances","","1","","14","","24 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing methods generally exploit the model-based features as the test statistic, such as energies and eigenvalues. However, these features could not accurately characterize the real environment. Motivated by this, in this paper, we use a deep neural network (DNN) to intelligently explore the data-driven test statistic. Firstly, we introduce a DNN-based detection framework, where a DNN-based likelihood ratio test (DNN-LRT) is derived to guarantee the optimality of the designed test statistic. As a realization of the developed DNN-based framework, we use the sample covariance matrix as the input of a convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a covariance matrix-aware CNN (CM-CNN)-based spectrum sensing algorithm, which further improves the performance. In addition, we also provide the theoretical analysis of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first time to analyze the theoretical performance of CNN-based methods. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is close to that of the optimal detector. Particularly, the proposed method could achieve a detection probability of 96.7% with a false alarm probability of 1.9% at SNR = -18dB, which significantly outperforms the conventional methods.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2933892","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792213","Cognitive radio;spectrum sensing;deep learning;convolutional neural network","Sensors;Covariance matrices;Feature extraction;Uncertainty;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Analytical models;Cognitive radio","cognitive radio;convolutional neural nets;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;radio spectrum management;signal detection;statistical testing;telecommunication computing","deep CM-CNN;cognitive radio;model-based features;eigenvalues;deep neural network;data-driven test statistic;DNN-based detection framework;DNN-based likelihood ratio test;DNN-LRT;designed test statistic;developed DNN-based framework;sample covariance matrix;convolutional neural network;covariance matrix-aware CNN-based spectrum sensing algorithm;CNN-based methods;noise figure 18.0 dB","","22","","42","","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, we develop a hardware environment for efficient evaluation of computer systems. We propose and develop an IBM PC Compatible SoC on an FPGA where hardware developers can evaluate their custom architectures. The SoC has an x86 soft core processor which can run general purpose operating systems. By making the proposed system run on FPGAs of two major vendors, i.e. Xilinx and Altera, we believe that it can be widely adopted. Besides, the SoC can be used for learning computer systems, because of its open-source policy. In this paper, we detail the design and implementation of the proposed SoC, and verify that it accurately runs some applications.

NOMAD's nervous system consists of an auditory system, a visual system, a taste system, sets of motor neurons capable of triggering behavior, a tracking system driven by visual stimuli, and a value system. The device itself, which moves autonomously, has a CCD camera for vision, microphones for hearing, and a gripper manipulator to pick up and taste objects by measuring the object's conductivity. Similar to a biological organism, NOMAD learns to categorize sensory information from its environment with no prior instruction, associate positive and negative value with this sensory information, and then learn to select the appropriate motor actions.

Does the feasible state space have good connectivity? We address the problem of determining suitable motion planning strategies that can work on a diverse set of applications. We have developed a planning system that does this by running competing planners in parallel. In this paper, we present an approach that constructs a planner ensemble - a set of complementary planners that lever-age a diverse set of assumptions. Our approach optimizes the submodular selection criteria with a greedy approach and lazy evaluation. We seed our selection with learnt priors on planner performance, thus allowing us to solve new applications without evaluating every planner on that application. We present results in simulation where the selected ensemble outperforms the best single planner and does almost as well as an off-line planner.

The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, named Dynamic-Fuzzy Neural Constrained Optimization Method (D-FUNCOM), based on the concept of constrained optimization. The proposed algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structures. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is presented as well.

Compared with most existing results, proposed approach contributes on two main aspects, i.e. 1) distributed event-triggered control has been developed for a more general high-order nonlinear MAS, and 2) The impacts from practical imperfections, e.g. system uncertainties, have been considered. Firstly, the system uncertainties are considered as bounded with a given upper bound. Through incorporating the upper bound of system uncertainties, a novel distributed event-triggered condition has been developed that can maintain the consensus of uncertain nonlinear MAS. Then, the system uncertainties are considered as unknown completely. A novel event-triggered distributed adaptive consensus control has been developed. For handling the unknown system dynamics, a series of novel distributed adaptive estimators have been designed to learn the system dynamics by using measured system data. Then, using the learnt system, the distributed event-triggered condition can be attained. Lyapunov stability analysis have been adopted to demonstrate the stability of developed novel event-triggered distributed consensus control. Eventually, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed designs.","","978-1-5386-2035-9","10.1109/RCAR.2017.8311929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8311929","","Adaptation models;Uncertainty;System dynamics;Stability analysis;Control systems;Multi-agent systems","adaptive control;distributed control;Lyapunov methods;multi-agent systems;nonlinear control systems;stability;uncertain systems","high-order nonlinear multiagent systems;system uncertainties;uncertain system dynamics;distributed event-triggered control;uncertain nonlinear MAS;distributed adaptive estimators;event triggered distributed adaptive consensus control;Lyapunov stability analysis","","","","30","","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While many solutions for the online VNE problem exist, only few have focused on methods that can be generally applied for optimization of online embeddings. In this paper, we propose an admission control based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to improve the overall system performance for the online VNE problem. Before running a VNE algorithm to embed a virtual network request, the RNN predicts whether the request will be accepted by the VNE algorithm based on the current state of the substrate and the virtual network request (VNR). The RNN prevents VNE algorithms from spending time on VNRs that are either infeasible or that cannot be embedded in acceptable time. In order to train and operate the RNN efficiently, we additionally propose new representations for substrate networks and virtual network requests. The representations are based on topological and network resource features to represent the substrate network and the VNRs with low computational complexity. Via simulations, we show that our admission control reduces the overall computational time for the online VNE problem by up to 91 % while preserving VNE performance on average. Using our new substrate and request representations, the RNN achieves an accuracy ranging between 89 % and 98 % for different VNE algorithms, substrate sizes, and VNR arrival rates.","2165-963X","978-1-5090-3236-5","10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7818395","Virtual network embedding;mathematical optimization;admission control;machine learning;neural networks","Substrates;Admission control;Prediction algorithms;Runtime;Mathematical programming;Neural networks;Communication networks","computational complexity;optimisation;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication networks","boost online virtual network embedding;neural networks;admission control;physical resource allocation;online VNE;online embedding optimization;recurrent neural network;RNN;VNR;substrate networks;virtual network requests;computational complexity","","22","","45","","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A practically interesting control task may be forcing the motion of a ""sick"" neuron to trace the trajectory generated by an ""ideal"" one on the basis of an available approximate model. In both cases the existence of three different parameter settings is assumed. As is well known essentially nonlinear systems cannot be well controlled on the basis of linearized models and linear techniques. The general nonlinear technique uses Lyapunov's ""direct"" method that guarantees global stability of the solution that otherwise suffers from several deficiencies. An alternative approach that removes these deficiencies at the cost of giving up global stability uses a special iteration created by a particular fixed point transformation. In the present paper a systematic method is presented for the generation of whole families of fixed point transformations that can be used in nonlinear adaptive control of Single Input -- Single Output (SISO) systems.

However, the application of the state-of-the-art motion planning strategies, that have been developed for rigid robots, could be challenging in continuum robots. This, in fact, is due to the compliance that continuum robots possess besides their increased number of degrees of freedom. In this paper, a Demonstration Guided Pose Planning (DGPP) technique is proposed to learn and subsequently plan for spatial point-to-point motions for multi-section continuum robots. Motion demonstrations, including position and orientation, are collected from a human via a flexible input interface that is developed to command the continuum robot intuitively via teleoperation. A dynamic model based on Euler-Lagrange formalism is derived for a two-section continuum robot to be considered while planning for the robot motions. Meanwhile, a Proportional-Derivative (PD) computed torque controller with a Model Reference Adaptive Kinematic Control (MRAKC) scheme are developed to ensure the tracking performance against system uncertainties and disturbances. Also, the system stability analysis based on Lyapunov quadratic equation is proven.

Although an introduction to PID control is referenced in many textbooks, practical PID tuning techniques applicable to the manufacturing field have not yet been established. As a result PID controllers are often tuned through the experience and intuition of technical staff and operators. In this paper, we introduce a basic PID control lecture outline which avoids complex numerical formulas. In our lectures, trainees can visually learn PID control using a PID Excel simulator, able to simulate process behavior in the case of control parameters changes.Generally, PID tuning techniques are divided into two categories; open-loop and closed-loop types. In the open-loop type, a step response test is required for PID tuning. From this test, the process gain Kp, dead time L and the time constant T are obtained to determine the PID parameters. In practice, step response tests are rarely implemented in the manufacturing field, due to their direct disturbance to production activity. As an alternative method, PID parameters can be determined through consistent oscillation using proportional control alone in a closed loop. However, as consistent oscillation potentially damages the plant facility, this PID tuning method is also not accessible in the field. Therefore, we propose a practical PID tuning method using damped oscillation generated by proportional control. We believe that in light of advanced automatic PID tuning systems utilizing AI technology being introduced in the near future, current service business development in this sector has a tendency to hide the underlying basic technology. To prevent the future industry from becoming blind to basic process control technology, we aim to contribute to the transfer of PID parameters tuning techniques to technical staff and operators working in plants.","1948-3457","978-1-7281-1164-3","10.1109/ICCA.2019.8900005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900005","","Tuning;PD control;PI control;Process control;Manufacturing;Oscillators;Education","computer aided instruction;control engineering education;control system analysis computing;control system synthesis;feedback;manufacturing systems;process control;production engineering computing;spreadsheet programs;three-term control;tuning","practical PID tuning method;advanced automatic PID tuning systems;basic process control technology;PID parameters;technical staff;basic feedback control education;proportional-integral-derivative control;practical PID tuning techniques;manufacturing field;result PID controllers;basic PID control lecture outline;PID Excel simulator;control parameters changes;closed-loop types;open-loop type","","","","12","","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some traditional solutions such as iterative and geometric are inadequate if the manipulator is more complex.

For the animation creation, we provide students with material such as fundamentals for creating basic animation, explanations of graphics functions, basic animation creation method, its application and its programming example in printed form (black and white). However, it is difficult for students to see the actual color or motion in printed material, because some of the animation is only shown on the screen and it is difficult for the students to actually reproduce the motion or examine the source codes by themselves. In order to overcome those problems, we have developed teaching material on the Web and actually used them in programming course. As a result it is clear that this material contributes to the increase in LOC, FP and the volume of animation created.

From the editorial of Science Robotics in 2017, there are six levels of autonomy and the existing tele-operation lies in level 0 (no autonomy). Although full autonomy would be fictional in the current moment, task/shared autonomy would be highly achievable. In endoluminal surgeries, surgeons rely on manual operation of flexible instruments for tissue manipulation and dissection. The techniques are difficult to learn, which makes them a good candidate for automation. In this letter, we introduce our work on shared autonomy of a flexible manipulator in simulated constrained endoluminal tasks, e.g., tissue dissection task in transanal total mesorectal excision and endoscopic submucosal dissection operations. During the procedure, the operator defines the dissection trajectory with a Novint Falcon device by marking via points. The dissection trajectory is dynamically planned based on the feedback from stereo endoscope system with consideration of the deformation of material. Furthermore, trajectory of the flexible manipulator is controlled by an adaptive controller with consideration of the possible collision between instruments and surrounding environment. This framework is validated by a mock up test with a three-degree-of-freedom flexible manipulator.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2924851","Hong Kong General Research Grant; Early Career Scheme; SJTU-CUHK; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745505","Medical robots and systems;sensor-based control;computer vision for automation","Surgery;Manipulators;Trajectory;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Electrostatic discharges","adaptive control;biological organs;cancer;endoscopes;feedback;flexible manipulators;haptic interfaces;medical robotics;surgery;tumours","constrained endoluminal surgical tasks;endoluminal surgeries;flexible instruments;tissue manipulation;tissue dissection task;transanal total mesorectal excision;endoscopic submucosal dissection operations;dissection trajectory;three-degree-of-freedom flexible manipulator;tele-operation;adaptive controller","","1","","23","","25 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method first divides signal fingerprints into static features and dynamic features, where the former describe the inherent features of emitters, and the latter represent the moving state features of emitters. Then, the feedback classification algorithm composed of dynamic curve fitting and back propagation (BP) neural network is applied in the classification of signals. The dynamic curve accomplishes the first classification and the results with high credibility are used to train the BP neural network which accomplishes the final classification.

In the present paper the operation of this controller is studied in the case of an incompletely modeled dynamic system, that is when the system to be controlled contains internal degree of freedom not modeled by the controller. As starting point the method uses a simple, incomplete dynamic model to predict the propagation of the state of the modeled degrees of freedom also influenced by that of the unmodeled internal ones by nonlinear coupling. The controller is restricted to the observation of the behavior of the generalized coordinates the models of which are available for it. By the use of a priori known, uniform, lucid structure of reduced size, simple and short explicit algebraic procedures especially fit to real-time applications the controller is able to learn the behavior of the observed system. Simulation examples are presented for the control of a double pendulum-cart system in which the first pendulum and the linear degree of freedom of the cart has drives only. The second pendulum can move freely and serves as the unmodeled component. Rotation of the second pendulum influences the inertia matrix of the whole system. It can obtain potential energy via the inertial and gravitational forces. It is found that the adaptive controller can successfully cope with the problem of imperfect modeling.","","83-7143-272-0","10.1109/ROMOCO.2004.240635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359480","","Adaptive control;Predictive models;Cybernetics;Control system synthesis;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Couplings;Real time systems;Size control;Control systems;Potential energy","time-varying systems;adaptive control;fuzzy logic;neural nets;uncertainty handling;pendulums;observers;cybernetics","adaptive control;dynamic system;computational cybernetics;soft computing;pendulum-cart system;inertia matrix","","1","","18","","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional PID control of such equipment have to cope with the problem of instabilities due to the friction forces between the piston and the cylinder, and the uncertainties and variation of its hydrodynamic parameters that in general makes it unrealistic to develop an accurate model for them. Brocker and Lemmen proposed two different control approaches for such systems, based on the disturbance rejection, and on the partial flatness principles, respectively. In each case it is necessary to measure the external disturbance force and its time-derivative as well as to know the exact model of the hydraulic cylinder. Later on Tar et al. proposed an alternative adaptive approach that does not require to measure the disturbance force and to know the exact parameters of the cylinder. This method rejected to use time-derivatives because of the presence of friction, and, as a consequence it resulted in a very hectic transient phase of learning. In this paper an alternative approach is presented that combines this approach with the use of calculated time-derivatives that are ""rejected"" by adaptively varying the order of the derivations applied. In this way the harsh initial transients can be evaded.

A neural network-based observer estimates states of the system and a neural network-based controller is designed to approximate input control signal. The estimated states by the observer are inputs of the controller and two neural networks (NNs) interact together such that the output of the system tracks the desired trajectory. Unlike most of the previous adaptive observers and controllers which employed linear in parameter neural networks (LPNNs), the proposed observer and controller are based on the nonlinear in parameter neural networks (NLPNNs). Hence, the proposed scheme supports global approximation property and is applicable to the systems with high degrees of nonlinearity. NNs learning rules are developed based on the well-known back propagation (BP) algorithm which has been proven to be the most relevant updating rule for control problems and despite most of the previous work by adding robustifying terms to the learning rules uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of all signals of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by Lyapunov's direct method.

To fully utilize network interfaces on multi-homed terminals and the whole network resources, MPTCP is proposed as an extension of TCP to transfer packets concurrently over multiple paths. Cross layer optimization techniques have been applied for MPTCP such as routing and path management. However, existing multipath routing algorithms and network modeling techniques are facing the challenges of subflow asymmetry due to network heterogeneity, thus cannot handle routing optimization problems comprehensively. To address these problems, in this paper, firstly, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based multipath routing model is proposed to explore the complications among links, paths, subflows and the MPTCP connection on various topologies. Leveraging the GNN model, expected throughput can be predicted with given network topology and multipath routes, which can further be the guidance for optimzing the multipath routing. Then, GCLR, a GNN based cross layer optimization system for MPTCP by routing, is proposed with the help of SDN (Software Defined Networking). According to simulation results, our off-line learned GNN model can predict the expected throughput of specific MPTCP connections with very low error. Besides, it's validated that the model has high generalization ability in terms of connection arbitrary and topology arbitrary, it can maintain MSE (mean squared error) at a low level when the situations are not seen during training, which is sufficient for throughput prediction in multipath routing decisions. Finally, the online routing optimization system is realized using SDN, experimental results show that our proposed routing optimization system can achieve significant throughput enhancement compared with traditional multipath routing algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966045","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957071","Routing;multipath TCP;graph neural network;cross layer optimization;software defined networking","Routing;Throughput;Optimization;Cross layer design;Network topology;Bandwidth;Predictive models","graph theory;mobile radio;network interfaces;neural nets;optimisation;routing protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","GCLR;GNN-based cross layer optimization;multipath TCP;network interfaces;multihomed terminals;cross layer optimization techniques;path management;subflow asymmetry;network heterogeneity;routing optimization problems;graph neural network;MPTCP connection;GNN model;network topology;multipath routes;software defined networking;MPTCP connections;online routing optimization system;multipath routing algorithms;5G networks;mean squared error","","","","48","CCBY","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach here is based on using the output error of the system to train the NN controller without the need to assume or construct a separate model (NN or other type) for the unknown process dynamics. To implement such a direct adaptive control approach, it is required that connection weights in the NN be estimated while the system is being controlled. As a result of the feedback of the unknown process dynamics, however, it is not possible to determine the gradient of the loss function for use in standard (backpropagation-type) weight estimation algorithms. In principle, stochastic approximation algorithms in the standard (Kiefer-Wolfowitz) finite-difference form can be used for this weight estimation since they are based on gradient approximations from available system output errors. However, these algorithms will generally require a prohibitive number of observed system outputs. Therefore, this paper considers the use of a new stochastic approximation algorithm for this weight estimation, which is based on a ""simultaneous perturbation"" gradient approximation. It is shown that this algorithm can greatly enhance the efficiency over more standard stochastic approximation algorithms based on finite-difference gradient approximations.

The NN controller calculates the required bandwidth per call from online measurement of the traffic via its count process, instead of relying on simple parameters such as the peak and average bit rate and burst length. In order to simplify the design and obtain a small reaction time, the controller was realized using a hierarchical structure of a bank of small size, parallel NN units. Each unit is a feed forward backpropagation NN that has been trained to learn the complex nonlinear function that relates different traffic patterns and their required QOS with the corresponding bandwidth. A large set of training data that represents different traffic patterns with different QOS requirement has been used to ensure that the NN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new test data. The reported results prove that the NN approach is extremely effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods that are based upon mathematical or simulation approximations.","","0-7803-2489-7","10.1109/MILCOM.1995.483260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=483260","","Call admission control;Neural networks;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Length measurement;Bit rate;Size control;Feeds;Backpropagation","asynchronous transfer mode;switching networks;telecommunication networks;telecommunication congestion control;feedforward neural nets;backpropagation;telecommunication traffic;multimedia communication;telecommunication computing","parallel neural networks;ATM networks;call admission control algorithm;bandwidth;heterogeneous multimedia traffic;quality of service;QOS;neural network controller;online traffic measurement;count process;design;reaction time;hierarchical structure;feedforward neural network;backpropagation neural network;nonlinear function;traffic patterns;training data;test data","","2","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Collins",NA; NA,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","4 Dec 2014","2014","","","966","972","An important application of neural networks is the identification of the dynamics of a nonlinear system with no known closed-form model, especially a system whose dynamic behavior may change with time. When this is done quickly and robustly, the model may be used for closed-loop Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). NMPC methods that rely on linearization about an equilibrium point or excessive parameter tuning require a priori information that limits the robustness of those methods for a system with changing dynamic behavior. This paper presents a novel method for adaptive NMPC of multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems, called Sampling Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) that, like most MPC approaches, has the ability to enforce hard constraints on the system inputs and states. However, unlike other NMPC methods, it does not rely on linearizing the system or gradient based optimization. Instead, it discretizes the input space to the model via pseudo-random sampling and feeds the sampled inputs through the nonlinear plant, hence producing a graph for which an optimal path can be found using an efficient graph search method such as A* optimization. Although SBMPC can be applied to any form of a nonlinear model, here a radial basis function neural network is used to model the nonlinear system due to its ability to represent a very general class of nonlinear systems. Using the Minimal Resource Allocation Network (MRAN) learning algorithm, the neural network size and parameter values may be adjusted even while the controller is active. After presenting the general methodology, Adaptive SBMPC is used in simulation to control the chemical concentrations of flue gas exiting a steam boiler's combustion chamber, represented by a 3-state time-varying nonlinear model with two inputs and three outputs.","1062-922X","978-1-4799-3840-7","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974037","","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Predictive models;Optimization;Fuels;Predictive control","adaptive control;combustion;graph theory;MIMO systems;nonlinear control systems;optimisation;predictive control;radial basis function networks;sampling methods;time-varying systems","sampling based control;combustion process;neural network model;closed-loop nonlinear model predictive control;adaptive NMPC methods;multiple input multiple output systems;MIMO systems;sampling based model predictive control;pseudo-random sampling;nonlinear plant;graph search method;radial basis function neural network;nonlinear system modeling;minimal resource allocation network;MRAN learning algorithm;adaptive SBMPC;chemical concentration control;steam boiler combustion chamber;3-state time-varying nonlinear model","","3","","30","","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some existing results in the literature present a computational complexity which scales quadratically with the number of transmit antennas and the constellation order. Moreover, the accuracy of these approximations is low and it can lead to wrong Modulation and Coding Scheme selection. In this work we apply a Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network to compute the achievable rate of a generic Index Modulation link. The case of two antennas/polarizations is analyzed in depth, showing not only a one-hundred fold decrement of the Mean Square Error in the estimation of the capacity as compared with existing analytical approximations, but also a fifty times reduction of the computational complexity.

In general, it is difficult to adopt a model-based design to achieve this control objective due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances and parameter variations. In order to cope with this problem, an AFNNC system is investigated without the requirement of prior system information. In this model-free control scheme, a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) dynamic fuzzy model with on-line learning ability is constructed for representing the system dynamics of an n-link robot manipulator. Then, a four-layer fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) is utilized for estimating nonlinear dynamic functions in this fuzzy model. Moreover, the AFNNC law and adaptive tuning algorithms for FNN weights are established in the sense of Lyapunov stability analyses to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. Numerical simulations of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by DC servomotors are given to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed AFNNC methodology.

We address this issue by developing a probabilistic RLS (PRLS) estimator (also with a forgetting factor) for each model that takes the probability of the model being representative of the current plant dynamics into account in the update. The main advantage of adopting this local update approach is adaptation tuning flexibility. Specifically, the model adaptations can be made more aggressive while maintaining better parameter precision compared to the the standard RLS algorithm. The benefits from using the PRLS algorithm for model adaptation are demonstrated via simulations of a nylon-6,6 batch polymerization reactor.

One of such problem is the bandwidth allocation. This paper presents a new approach to the bandwidth allocation problem for video traffic using radial basis functions neural networks (RBFNN). Estimation of an accurate amount of bandwidth to support this traffic has been a challenging task using conventional algorithmic approaches. In this paper, we show that a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is capable of learning the non-linear multi-dimentional mapping between different multimedia traffic patterns quality of service (QoS) requirements and the required bandwidth to support each call. Our method employs ""on-line"" measurements of the traffic count process over a monitoring period which is determined such that the error in estimating the bandwidth is minimized to less than 3% of the actual value. In order to simplify the design of the RBFNN, the input traffic is preprocessed through a low pass filter in order to smooth all high frequency fluctuations. A large set of training data, representing different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, was used to ensure that RBFNN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new data. The reported results prove that the neurocomputing approach is effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods, based upon mathematical or simulation.","","0-7803-5284-X","10.1109/ICC.1999.767912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=767912","","Channel allocation;Bit rate;Communication system traffic control;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Traffic control;Radial basis function networks;Monitoring;Data preprocessing","bandwidth allocation;multimedia communication;visual communication;telecommunication control;radial basis function networks;telecommunication computing;asynchronous transfer mode;telecommunication traffic;quality of service","bandwidth allocation;variable bit rate video;ATM networks;radial basis function neural networks;multimedia traffic;traffic control;video traffic;RBFNN;nonlinear multi-dimentional mapping;multimedia traffic patterns;quality of service;monitoring;input traffic;low pass filter;high frequency fluctuations;neurocomputing approach","","","4","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since this problem tackling is mainly based on simple geometric and algebraic considerations a brief historical summary is given on the antecedents to exemplify the advantages of geometric way of thinking in Natural Sciences. Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. The already achieved results are exemplified via simulation, and the possible directions of the future research are briefly outlined, too.","","1-4244-1234-X","10.1109/SACI.2007.375477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4262479","","Adaptive control;Algebra;Vectors;Geometry;Lagrangian functions;Quaternions;Mathematics;Programmable control;Control systems;Control system synthesis","adaptive control;geometry;nonlinear control systems","nonlinear adaptive control;soft computing;temporal models;situation-dependent models;control system;iterative learning control;single input single output systems;primitive initial system models;control parameters;natural sciences;multiple input multiple output systems","","2","","50","","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the conventional works of the value iteration ADP, the model network is initialized randomly and trained by the backpropagation algorithm, whose results are easy to get trapped in a local minimum; both the critic network and action network are trained in each outer-loop, which is time-consuming. To approximate the optimal control policy more accurately and decrease the value iteration ADP training time, we propose a nearer optimal and faster trained value iteration ADP for discrete-time nonlinear systems in this study. First, before training the model network with a backpropagation algorithm, we use a global searching method, i.e., genetic algorithm, to evolve the weights and biases of the neural network for a few generations. Second, in the outer-loop training process, we propose a trigger mechanism to decide whether to train the action network or not, which can save much training time. Examples of both linear and nonlinear systems are induced to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with the conventional value iteration ADP. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a nearer optimal control policy and save more training time than the conventional value iteration ADP.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3051984","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9326299","ADP;value iteration;genetic algorithm;trigger mechanism","Neural networks;Training;Biological cells;Approximation algorithms;Nonlinear systems;Heuristic algorithms;Genetic algorithms","adaptive control;backpropagation;discrete time systems;dynamic programming;genetic algorithms;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimal control","faster trained value;ADP training time;approximate the optimal control policy;critic network;model network;adaptive dynamic programming;discrete-time nonlinear systems;nearer optimal control policy;conventional value;action network;outer-loop training process;neural network;backpropagation algorithm","","","","34","CCBY","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The systems may possess a class of uncertainties referred to as unstructured uncertain functions, which are not linearly parameterized and have no prior knowledge of the bound. The Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the uncertainties and a systematic design procedure is developed for synthesis of adaptive fuzzy control with H/sub /spl infin// performance, which combines the backstepping technique and generalized small gain approach. The method preserves the three advantages, those are, the semiglobal uniform ultimate bound of adaptive control in the presence of unstructured uncertainties can be guaranteed, the adaptive mechanism with only one learning parameter is obtained and the possible controller singularity problem in some of the existing adaptive control schemes with feedback linearization techniques can be removed. Performance and limitations of proposed method are discussed and illustrated with simulation results.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.839663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1393005","Adaptive control;fuzzy control;nonlinear systems;small gain approach","Adaptive control;Programmable control;Uncertainty;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Takagi-Sugeno model;Fuzzy logic","adaptive control;fuzzy control;H/sup /spl infin// control;feedback;nonlinear control systems;fuzzy logic;linearisation techniques","adaptive fuzzy H/sub /spl infin// stability;strict feedback canonical nonlinear system;backstepping;generalized small gain approach;adaptive fuzzy control;Takagi Sugeno system;fuzzy logic system;feedback linearization technique","","165","","38","","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

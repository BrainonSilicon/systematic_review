Although introducing immersive learning experience for MOOCs may sound exciting and potentially significative, there are a number of challenges given this unique setting. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation methodologies for delivering immersive learning experience to MOOC learners via multiple media. Specifically, we have applied the techniques in the production of a MOOC entitled Virtual Hong Kong: New World, Old Traditions, led by AIMtech Centre, City University of Hong Kong, which is the first MOOC (as our knowledge) that delivers immersive learning content for distant learners to appreciate and experience how the traditional culture and folklore of Hong Kong impact upon the lives of its inhabitants in the 21st Century.

A cross-sectional online survey that included the Assessing Determinants of Prospective Take-up of Virtual Reality (version 2; ADOPT-VR2) Instrument was conducted in 2014-2015 (Canada) and replicated in 2017-2018 (US). Recruitment took place via convenience and snowball sampling, using email, social media and newsletter postings. Therapists in the US reported greater past experience with, current use of, and intention to use VR/AVGs than did those in Canada. They also rated facilitators more positively and barriers less negatively. Use of customized VR systems was low, with specific system prevalence differing between countries. The most frequently used AVG systems, populations and settings of use, functional goals, predictors of use, learning needs and preferred forms of support were similar between countries. These similarities support the generalizability of educational interventions for both countries. Materials to be developed will focus on non-customized AVG systems. Subsequent work will examine how uptake relates to country-specific health care funding and policies, probe differences in learning needs between therapists with experience using customized versus non-customized VR/AVG systems, and extend the survey to other countries where VR/AVG use is prevalent.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994624","virtual reality;active video games;rehabilitation;survey;knowledge translation","","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;health care;medical information systems;virtual reality","virtual reality;active video game usage;Canada;US;occupational therapists;cross-country comparison;educational interventions;cross-sectional online survey;ADOPT-VR2;social media;newsletter postings;customized VR systems;noncustomized AVG systems;country-specific health care funding;system prevalence;PT","","1","","21","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its focus lies on the visualization of a probabilistic robot localization algorithm considering noise in the sensors and actuators of the robot on the one hand, as well as an environment filled with obstacles which damage the robot on contact on the other hand. The goal of the simulation is training students on the intricacies of the algorithm and to develop a notion on the impact of the considered factors such as the degree of sustained sensory noise. In order to facilitate learning and promote exploration, we embed a game mode that conveys the basic interactions with the simulator and the factors shaping the robot's behavior. In the game, the player helps the simulated robot to reach its destination with as little damage as possible. This is done by setting waypoints for the robot by adjusting the parameters of the deployed localization algorithm as well as the quality of sensors and the accuracy of the robots movements. By playing with these parameters, the user playfully learns their effects, which are visualized in 3D - contrary to the hard mathematical approach presented in books. SkyNetz also has the capacity to communicate with a real robot, to show its current position and position estimates. In the long run, this will provide the foundation for novel augmented reality games. The paper includes a general introduction to the topic of interactive robot simulation, background on the specific problem of localization estimation, the presentation of our approach and the results from a small user study.","","978-1-5090-2722-4","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2016.7590365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590365","","Robot sensing systems;Collision avoidance;Kalman filters;Games;Probabilistic logic","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;data visualisation;digital simulation;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;probability","Skynetz;playful experiential robotics simulator;playful interactive robotics simulator;computer science students;probabilistic robot localization algorithm;actuators;training students;sensory noise;game mode;robot behavior;3D visualization;augmented reality games;localization estimation problem","","","","9","","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors propose to extend it by endowing the system with some a priori knowledge, in the form of precepts. Advantages of the augmented system are speed-up, improved generalization, and greater parsimony. The authors present a precept-driven learning algorithm.

Relevance and implementation of these features as well as the benefits of virtual learning environments over traditional educational approaches in general are rarely explored. Focusing on modes of interaction in this work, we examined the effect of different motion types on the knowledge acquisition of users in various virtual environments. For our study we chose a simple memorization task as approximation of low cognitive knowledge acquirement. We hypothesized motion types and immersion levels influence memorization performance in virtual environments. The memorization task was conducted in two virtual environments with different levels of immersion: A high-immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a low-immersive desktop virtual environment. Two motion types in virtual environments were explored: Physical and virtual walking. In the CAVE physical walking was implemented by using motion capturing and virtual walking was realized using a joystick-like input device. The results indicate neither motion types nor immersion levels in virtual environments affect memorization performance significantly.","2377-9322","978-1-4673-4703-7","10.1109/CIVEMSA.2013.6617404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617404","cognition;human computer interaction;learning;memory;motion;virtual environment;virtual reality","Virtual environments;Navigation;Legged locomotion;Tutorials;Stereo vision;Educational institutions","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;human factors;interactive devices;virtual reality","training;education;CAVE physical walking;virtual walking;low-immersive desktop virtual environment;high-immersive CAVE automatic virtual environment;hypothesized motion types;cognitive knowledge acquirement;user knowledge acquisition;virtual learning environments;user process;virtual environment design;training purposes;memorization performance","","4","","12","","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These problems are addressed by reinforcement learning algorithms like policy gradient methods. We describe how to stabilise the policy gradient descent by introducing a regularisation term to enhance the episodic natural actor-critic approach. This allows a more policy independent usage. We used the resulting algorithm to optimise a z-transformed rational function representing the control policy. This representation facilitates simultaneous optimisation of the control structure and its parameters in time space and can be analysed in terms of control theory to predict the control behaviour for arbitrary scenarios. Furthermore we present a solution to the general problem of finding a initial parameter set with the help of a single demonstrated trajectory. The approach is evaluated on a cartpole simulation for demonstrating the expressiveness of the policy. Furthermore, a real soccer robot scenario demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach to deal with real world scenarios.","2325-1867","978-1-4244-9888-8","10.1109/ADPRL.2011.5967352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967352","","Equations;Estimation;Trajectory;Function approximation;Mathematical model;Transfer functions;Approximation algorithms","adaptive control;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;mobile robots;stability","episodic natural actor-critic algorithm;regularisation term;control structure learning stability;reinforcement learning algorithms;policy gradient methods;z-transformed rational function;soccer robot scenario;arbitrary scenarios;control behaviour","","","","14","","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The significance of individual-specific factors, such as general trait anxiety and personality, as well as contextual factors, such as age, gender, highest education, and native language, in moderating the association between bio-behavioral indices and PSA is further examined through group-based machine learning models. Results highlight the importance of including such factors for detecting PSA with the proposed group-based PSA models yielding Spearman's correlation of 0.55(p <; 0.05) between the actual and predicted state-based anxiety scores.

We analyzed the relationship between perceived application usefulness, perceived application enjoyment, perceived exhibition enjoyment, and perceived quiz enjoyment. In addition, we examined perceived sociability before and after the quiz, quiz score, and user behavior in the exhibition space.

An effective design method of the iterative learning control law is proposed. Based on 2D prediction model, the differential optimization of the objective function is carried out to derive the GPILC law. Then, based on the nonlinear Hammerstein model of ultrasonic motor, an inverse compensation method for the motor's nonlinearity is designed to realize the effective compensation for motor's nonlinearity. On this basis, a generalized predictive iterative learning speed controller for ultrasonic motors is designed.

However, the mechanisms of navigating within a virtual environment have primarily been constrained to handheld input devices akin to gaming controllers. For people unfamiliar with traditional gaming input devices, VR navigation devices are not intuitively mapped to real-world modes of locomotion and can be frustrating and disorienting. Designers have largely focused on utility (the ability to efficiently accomplish a task) to the detriment of usability (ease of use). The industry lacks an intuitive, universal method of navigation that can be easily learned by novice participants. Dr. Jakob Nielsen identified five factors that impact usability in human-computer interactions (HCI): learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Previous research in virtual environment locomotion incorporated teaching time periods where the researchers explained the control devices to participants. We believe that this neglected one of the key usability factors in human-computer interactions: learnability, or the ability and ease to accomplish a task the first time a user encounters it. Our research focuses on comparing existing modes of navigation (game controller based) with a mode of controller-less fully embodied navigation between two demographics based on Nielsen's usability factors. Existing research has demonstrated little noticeable learnability difference between modes of rotation and lean-based navigation, and joystick navigation in VR [1]; however, similar study demonstrates that partially embodied leaning mechanics can positively affect sensory perception in VR [2]. While previous Studies in controller-less VR navigation methods have demonstrated an inclination toward subject motion sickness when controllers are removed [3], other research has yielded positive qualitative results (sans motion sickness) when partially embodied alternative controller systems are used [4]. Additional research into partially embodied alternative controller systems has, in fact, indicated a preference toward existing modes of controller-based joystick navigation in VR subjects [5]; however, when partially embodied leaning mechanics are combined with another mode of sensory perception, like foot haptics, self-motion perception (vection) is enhanced [6]. In this study, we test a fully embodied mode of navigation to evaluate whether a fully engaged body experiences more positive usability results according to HCI measures. We test our results within communities of self-identified gamers and non-gamers, evaluating navigation modes designed for joystick control pads, trigger-based teleportation, and controller-less embodied navigation. Our research inquires whether embodied navigation enhances usability in accordance with Nielsen's usability factors, specifically enabling easier access and engagement for inexperienced subj e ct s, compared with controller-based modes of navigation.","","978-1-5386-6304-2","10.1109/GEM.2018.8516499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8516499","","Navigation;Hardware;Games;Media;Usability;Virtual environments","computer games;human computer interaction;interactive devices;navigation;teaching;user interfaces;virtual reality","virtual reality environments;gaming controllers;VR navigation devices;real-world modes;human-computer interactions;virtual environment locomotion incorporated teaching time periods;control devices;key usability factors;game controller;Nielsen's usability factors;partially embodied leaning mechanics;controller-less VR navigation methods;controller-based joystick navigation;fully embodied mode;joystick control pads;controller-based modes;navigation modes;alternative controller systems;gaming input devices","","1","","6","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

Analysis of typical missions such as mine countermeasures and search/salvage yielded a set of general skills to be taught including manoeuvring, situational awareness, sensor data integration, and mission operations. Use of VE technology permits the creation of an enriched learning environment including simulation of a wide range of operational environments, vehicle configurations, learning aids, rind mission scenarios. The prototype training system is a VE-based Intelligent Tutor which implements various training aids and interventions to promote the development of both the sensorimotor and cognitive skills related to basic manoeuvring tasks and situational awareness.

The detection accuracy of UE statuses thus becomes a dominant factor in data retrieval performance. At this background, a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) enabled convolutional neural network (CNN) scheme is proposed for UE status detection. In order to reduce detection complexity, K parallel CNN structures are used, each of which decides the status of the UE associated with a respective RE. Mismatched decisions are resolved by the soft outputs from each CNN classifier. Simulation results show that the proposed GLR-enabled parallel CNNs with soft mismatch resolution can achieve 10-5 detection error probability at moderate to high SNRs, regardless of time correlation characteristic of channel gains, when the Rayleigh amplitude distortion of the channel can be removed by a sophisticate power control mechanism.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9348048","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348048","machine learning;convolutional neural network;sparse coded multiple access","Error probability;Simulation;Power control;Machine learning;Distortion;Global communication;Uplink","code division multiple access;computational complexity;convolutional neural nets;decoding;error statistics;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection;telecommunication computing","UE statuses;data retrieval performance;convolutional neural network scheme;UE status detection;detection complexity;K parallel CNN structures;mismatched decisions;soft outputs;CNN classifier;GLR-enabled parallel CNNs;soft mismatch resolution;detection error probability;generalized likelihood-ratio enabled machine;UE detection;grant-free SCMA;GF-SCMA;detection accuracy;generalized likelihood ratio enabled machine learning;uplink grant-free sparse coded multiple access system","","","","14","","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the accepted breadth of viable industrial robotic applications increasing, the need for flexible robotic training also grows. In the area of simulation and offline programming there have been innovative developments to Computer Aided Robotics (CAR) Systems. New and notable releases have been introduced to the public, especially among the small, affordable, and easy to use systems. These CAR-Systems are mainly aimed at system integrators in general industry business fields to whom the complex, powerful software tools used by the automotive industry (and its suppliers) are oversized. In general, CAR-Systems are used to design robot cells and to create the offline programs necessary to reduce start-up time and to achieve a considerable degree of planning reliability. Another potential yet to be fully considered, is the use of such CAR-Systems as an inexpensive and user-friendly tool for robotics training. This paper will show the educational potential and possibility inherent in simulation and introduce a successful example of this new method of training.

Virtual Reality has demonstrated advantages applied to Education, providing immersive experiences and new ways of visualization and interaction. However, this technology has not been extensively explored in Software Engineering. In this sense, this paper aims to present a disruptive method of teaching and learning support on fundamentals in object orientation paradigm based on Immersive Learning, called OO Game VR. In addition, an initial heuristic evaluation was performed with 6 subjects in order to identify usability problems. Despite problems found related to support learning, navigation and orientation, the natural expression of action and clear entry and exit points, the subjects were able to perform all the tasks, showing indications that the application has the potential to support teaching of OOP teaching through Immersive Learning.

The core idea of the SLSBD schemes is to interpret the semi-blind detection problem as a multiclass classification problem in the context of machine learning. Specifically, during the model training phase, a learning system is trained online using the training sequence. The receiver then uses the trained model to determine the category of each received signal, thus achieving transmitted signal recovery. We exploit the classical classification algorithms, k-nearest neighbors (KNN)and support vector machine (SVM)to solve this supervised learning problem. The simulation results show that, with the same training sequence length, both KNN and SVM-based detection schemes are capable of achieving better performance than that of the improved K-means clustering (IKMC)detection and conventional channel estimation-based matched filter (MF)detection, while they maintain low complexity.","2472-7628","978-1-7281-3555-7","10.1109/WCSP.2019.8928015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8928015","Blind detection;supervised learning;multiclass classification;KNN;SVM;generalized space shift keying (GSSK)","Training;Support vector machines;Detectors;Supervised learning;Transmitting antennas;MIMO communication;Modulation","channel estimation;communication complexity;MIMO communication;nearest neighbour methods;supervised learning;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","space shift generalization;supervised learning-based semiblind detection schemes;transmitted signal recovery;received signal;trained model;learning system;machine learning;multiclass classification problem;semiblind detection problem;SLSBD schemes;channel state information;multiple-input multiple-output systems;MIMO systems;supervised learning-based semiblind detection;filter detection;channel estimation;SVM-based detection schemes;training sequence length;supervised learning problem","","","","22","","8 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a potentially significant feature for SSG design and evaluation, the term fidelity (the similarity between an SSG and its real reference) emerges and attracts increasing attention. The study of fidelity not only benefits the design, development, and analysis of an SSG with the consideration of improving the learning effect but also contributes to the investment reduction of an SSG. However, the term fidelity is used inconsistently in the current literature. The introduction of new technologies (e.g., virtual reality) and the blend of multiform SSGs also facilitate the extension of fidelity with new connotations. All lead to confusing concepts and vague measure metrics. Besides, the relationship between fidelity and learning effect is still uncertain. A new vision and a comprehensive conceptual framework of fidelity for more general applications are in need. In this paper, further exploration and discussion of these issues in relation to fidelity of SSGs are presented through a systematic review. A general conceptual framework considering both aspects of the SSG system itself and the learners is developed and applied to analyze fidelity in SSGs.

However, visual presentation of FLLRs lacks theoretical guidance, which results in the problem of being monotonous in form and inadequate manifestation of knowledge. Knowledge visualization theory provides a new perspective for FLLR design in which selection of proper foreign language knowledge (FLK) visual representations is one of the key steps to facilitate knowledge communication to learners. By analyzing the relevant concepts of visual representation, the study proposes six types of FLK visual representations, namely general text, graph and diagram, static image, camera video, animation and virtual reality. Moreover, the study puts forward five representation dimensions, including knowledge description, logic presentation, context building, pragmatic demonstration and culture exhibition.

In this paper, we present a study that compares the effectiveness of virtual training and physical training for teaching a bimanual assembly task. In a between-subjects experiment, 60 participants were trained to solve three 3D burr puzzles in one of six conditions comprised of virtual and physical training elements. In the four physical conditions, training was delivered via paper- and video-based instructions, with or without the physical puzzles to practice with. In the two virtual conditions, participants learnt to assemble the puzzles in an interactive virtual environment, with or without 3D animations showing the assembly process. After training, we conducted immediate tests in which participants were asked to solve a physical version of the puzzles. We measured performance through success rates and assembly completion testing times. We also measured training times as well as subjective ratings on several aspects of the experience. Our results show that the performance of virtually trained participants was promising. A statistically significant difference was not found between virtual training with animated instructions and the best performing physical condition (in which physical blocks were available during training) for the last and most complex puzzle in terms of success rates and testing times. Performance in retention tests two weeks after training was generally not as good as expected for all experimental conditions. We discuss the implications of the results and highlight the validity of virtual reality systems in training.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2793638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260860","Learning transfer;virtual reality;assembly;training","Training;Testing;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual environments;Haptic interfaces","assembling;computer animation;computer based training;interactive systems;virtual reality","physical training transfer;bimanual assembly task;consumer virtual reality technology;traditional training formats;virtual training;3D burr puzzles;physical puzzles;interactive virtual environment;physical blocks;virtual reality systems;assembly completion testing","Adult;Female;Humans;Male;Task Performance and Analysis;Transfer, Psychology;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","9","","23","CCBY","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The apprenticeship model augments self-supervised learning with learning by demonstration, efficiently using the human's time and expertise while facilitating future scalability to supervision of multiple robots; the human provides demonstrations via virtual reality when the robot cannot complete the task autonomously. Experimental results indicate that the robot learns a grasping task with the apprenticeship model faster than with a solely self-supervised approach and with fewer human interventions than a solely demonstration-based approach; 100% grasping success is obtained after 150 grasps with 19 demonstrations. Preliminary user studies evaluating workload, usability, and effectiveness of the system yield promising results for system scalability and deployability.

This paper is focused on two types of adaptive critic design, one is action dependent and the other uses an approximation of the plant dynamics. The goal of this paper is to gain insight into the theoretical and practical differences between these two controllers, when applied in an online environment with changing plant dynamics. To investigate the practical differences the controllers are implemented for a model of the general dynamics F-16 and the characteristics of the controllers are investigated and compared to each other by conducting several experiments in two phases. First the controllers are trained offline to control the baseline F-16 model, next the dynamics of the F-16 model are changed online and the controllers will have to adapt to the new plant dynamics. The result from the offline experiments show that the controller with the approximated plant dynamics has a higher success ratio for learning to control the baseline F-16 model.

This study determined whether it takes longer to learn to control a virtual limb actuated by a muscle model compared to a simpler force-generator model. Subjects practiced moving a myoelectrically-driven virtual limb from rest to a target position with maximum speed and accuracy. In a muscle model group (n=10), the biceps electromyographic signal activated a virtual muscle that pulled on the virtual limb with a force governed by muscle dynamics, defined by a nonlinear force-length-velocity relation and series-elastic stiffness. A forcegenerator group (n=10) performed the same task, but the actuation force was a linear function of the biceps activation signal. Generalization was assessed with untrained target trials. The results showed that the muscle model group improved performance as fast as the force-generator group and showed greater generalization in early practice. This suggests that incorporating muscle dynamics into a virtual limb does not incur a learning “cost” over the use of simpler actuator models.","2160-7028","978-1-4799-3728-8","10.1109/NEBEC.2014.6972812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6972812","virtual limb;muscle mechanics;motor learning;prosthetic limb;muscle dynamics;nervous system","Muscles;Force;Dynamics;Prosthetics;Actuators;Standards;Measurement uncertainty","biomechanics;elastic constants;electromyography;physiological models;prosthetics;virtual reality","actuator properties;learning to control;prosthetic devices;muscle dynamics;learning demands;simpler force-generator model;myoelectrically-driven virtual limb;rest position;target position;maximum speed;maximum accuracy;muscle model group;biceps electromyographic signal;virtual muscle;nonlinear force-length-velocity relation;series-elastic stiffness;actuation force;linear function;biceps activation signal;generalization;untrained target trials;force-generator group;learning cost","","","","5","","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning-based methods have recently emerged as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for MINLPs with affordable computational complexity. There have been some attempts in applying such methods to resource management in wireless networks, but these attempts require huge amounts of training samples and lack the capability to handle constrained problems. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance deterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and is referred to as the task mismatch problem. In this paper, to reduce the sample complexity and address the feasibility issue, we propose a framework of Learning to Optimize for Resource Management (LORM). In contrast to the end-to-end learning approach adopted in previous studies, LORM learns the optimal pruning policy in the branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs via a sample-efficient method, namely, imitation learning. To further address the task mismatch problem, we develop a transfer learning method via self-imitation in LORM, named LORM-TL, which can quickly adapt a pre-trained machine learning model to the new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that LORM outperforms specialized state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves near-optimal performance, while providing significant speedup compared with the branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, LORM-TL, by relying on a few unlabeled samples, achieves comparable performance with the model trained from scratch with sufficient labeled samples.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2947591","General Research Funding from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8879693","Resource allocation;mixed-integer nonlinear programming;wireless communications;few-shot learning;transfer learning","Resource management;Optimization;Machine learning algorithms;Wireless networks;Training;Machine learning;Heuristic algorithms","computational complexity;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);nonlinear programming;radio networks;telecommunication computing;tree searching","end-to-end learning approach;optimal pruning policy;branch-and-bound algorithm;MINLP;sample-efficient method;imitation learning;task mismatch problem;transfer learning method;named LORM-TL;pre-trained machine;additional unlabeled training samples;achieves near-optimal performance;unlabeled samples;sufficient labeled samples;wireless networks;effective resource management;mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems;machine learning-based methods;affordable computational complexity;constrained problems;severe performance deterioration;network parameters change;sample complexity","","14","","35","IEEE","22 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this study aims at examining the effects of usability and learning objective factors in evaluating students' performance impact from using virtual laboratory. The study proposes a theoretical model based on usability factors of technology acceptance model (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) and laboratory learning objectives (instruments, creativity and innovation) to capture the entire patterns of students' perceptions and use outcomes from using the simulation-based virtual laboratory. The study collected survey data from 116 first year Electrical Engineering students from the University of Queensland in Australia, reflecting their personal experience in using virtual laboratory tools. Partial least square approach using structural equation modeling technique (PLS-SEM) was used for statistical analysis and model testing. The results confirm that the proposed model provides a comprehensive understanding of students' perceptions and the understudy factors were truly significant in reflecting their performance impact from using such laboratory tools.

Latencies in head-motion compensation cause virtual objects to swim around instead of being stable in space. This results in an unnatural feel, disorientation, and simulation sickness in addition to errors in fitting/matching of virtual and real objects. Visual update delays are a critical technical obstacle for implementation of head-mounted displays in a wide variety of applications. To address this problem, we propose to use machine learning techniques to define a forward model of head movement based on angular velocity information. In particular, we utilize recurrent neural network to capture the temporal pattern of pitch and yaw motion. Our results demonstrate an ability to predict head motion up to 40 ms. ahead thus eliminating the main source of latencies. The accuracy of the system is tested for conditions akin to those encountered in virtual environments. These results demonstrate successful generalization by the learning system.","1098-7576","0-7803-7898-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1224017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1224017","","Recurrent neural networks;Delay;Magnetic heads;Displays;Human factors;Angular velocity;System testing;Virtual environment;Neural networks;Knowledge based systems","recurrent neural nets;virtual reality;motion compensation;learning (artificial intelligence);helmet mounted displays","pitch head movements;yaw head movements;movements prediction;recurrent neural networks;virtual-environment applications;virtual objects;head-mounted display;virtual images;simulation sickness;visual update delays;machine learning techniques;latencies;40 ms","","3","1","13","","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work employs a SAN as a technique to provide the interface's action selection mechanism in an uncertain environment. The paper combines the SAN with the temporal logic to provide an e-learning system that a learning activity level evolves according to their expected contextual relevance. The system differs from the other e-learning by representing dynamic associations between learning activities and the relevance subjects. This system equipped with an event-triggered learning interface (context) adaptation component. This component provides multiple parallel processes for perception. These processes provide context screen selection and learning task operation based upon the user current situation. The SAN attempts to achieve a number of goals in an unpredictable complex dynamic environment. Spreading activation explains the predictive top-down effect of knowledge. It supports general heuristics which may be used as the first step of more elaborated methods. This model is suited to deal with the interaction between semantic and episodic memories, as well as many other practical issues regarding e-learning, including the retroactive effect of semantics over perception. The system uses the SAN to activate the most suitable interface screen (context) in response to the current conditions (learning activities) while the system continues working towards the learning objective goal. The paper presents our efforts to realize such e-learning system. The proposed paradigm has been implemented to develop a prototypical system, and the experiments also illustrate the robustness of such an e-learning framework","0840-7789","1-4244-0038-4","10.1109/CCECE.2006.277285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4055069","E-Learning;Human-Machine Interaction","Electronic learning;Storage area networks;Multimedia systems;Psychology;Humans;Learning systems;Computer architecture;IP networks;Discussion forums;Electronic mail","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;human factors;psychology;temporal logic","dynamic associative e-learning model;spreading activation network;dynamic semantic model;psycholinguistic theory;human memory;action selection mechanism;temporal logic;event-triggered learning interface adaptation component;parallel process;context screen selection","","1","","7","","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","computer aided instruction;computer animation;computer science education;solid modelling;student experiments;training;Turing machines;virtual reality","virtual experiments;virtual reality technology;introduction to computing;public course;student training;computer science;computational thinking;teaching contents;Turing machine;computer organization;3D modeling;animation;human-machine interaction;demonstration experiments;verification experiments;interaction experiments;software copyrights;teaching effectiveness;learning efficiency","","5","","10","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate how model-based reinforcement learning, in particular the probabilistic inference for learning control method (Pilco), can be tailored to cope with the case of sparse data to speed up learning. The basic idea is to include further prior knowledge into the learning process. As Pilco is built on the probabilistic Gaussian processes framework, additional system knowledge can be incorporated by defining appropriate prior distributions, e.g. a linear mean Gaussian prior. The resulting Pilco formulation remains in closed form and analytically tractable. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulation as well as on a physical robot, the Festo Robotino XT. For the robot evaluation, we employ the approach for learning an object pick-up task. The results show that by including prior knowledge, policy learning can be sped up in presence of sparse data.","1050-4729","978-1-4799-3685-4","10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907422","","Robots;Valves;Grasping;Data models;Pneumatic systems;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms","Gaussian distribution;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;probability;robots","policy search;learning robot control;sparse data;manipulation;grasping;dynamic environment;uncertain environment;sound learning;generalization performance;machine learning;system constraints;model-based reinforcement learning;probabilistic inference for learning control method;PILCO;probabilistic Gaussian processes framework;linear mean Gaussian prior distribution;physical robot;Festo Robotino XT;object pick-up task;policy learning","","6","1","14","","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on studying the learning capability of neural networks (NNs) during the control process. First, we propose a novel control scheme called distributed cooperative learning (DCL) control scheme, by establishing the communication topology among adaptive laws of NN weights to share their learned knowledge online. It is further proved that if the communication topology is undirected and connected, all estimated weights of NNs can converge to small neighborhoods around their optimal values over a domain consisting of the union of all state orbits. Second, as a corollary it is shown that the conclusion on the deterministic learning still holds in the decentralized adaptive neural control scheme where, however, the estimated weights of NNs just converge to small neighborhoods of the optimal values along their own state orbits. Thus, the learned controllers obtained by DCL scheme have the better generalization capability than ones obtained by decentralized learning method.

This paper proposes a biologically plausible cerebellar model with reinforcement learning based on the cerebellar neural circuitry to eliminate the need for explicit teacher signals. The learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning is first demonstrated by constructing a simulated cerebellar neural network agent and a detailed model of the human arm and muscle system in the Emergent virtual environment. Next, the cerebellar model is incorporated in both a simulated arm and a Geomagic Touch device to further verify the effectiveness of the cerebellar model in reaching tasks. Results from these experiments indicate that the cerebellar simulation is capable of driving the “arm plant” to arrive at the target positions accurately. Moreover, by examining the effect of the number of basic units, we find the results are consistent with previous findings that the central nervous system may recruit the muscle synergies to realize motor control. The study described here prompts several hypotheses about the relationship between motor control and learning and may be useful in the development of general-purpose motor learning systems for machines.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3042994","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285238","Cerebellum;cerebellar model;reinforcement learning;robotic limb control","Cerebellum;Brain modeling;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Integrated circuit modeling;Reinforcement learning;Adaptation models","adaptive control;biocontrol;brain models;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neurocontrollers;neurophysiology;robots","cerebellar neural circuitry;cerebellar reinforcement learning;simulated cerebellar neural network agent;human arm;muscle system;cerebellar simulation;motor control;biologically constrained cerebellar model;robotic limb control;supervised learning machine;biologically plausible cerebellar model;adaptive control;Geomagic touch device;general-purpose motor learning systems","","","","39","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed delay compensation approach relies on deep learning to predict the prospective head motion. We use our previously described head motion dataset for training, validation, and testing. To prove the general validity of our approach, we perform cross validation with another independent dataset. We use both qualitative measures and subjective experiments for evaluation.

Although significant progress has been made in emotion recognition for music, image and video stimuli, it remains largely unexplored for immersive virtual stimuli. Our main objective for this line of investigation is to enable consistently reliable emotion recognition for virtual reality stimuli using only cheap, commercial-off-the-shelf electroencephalography (EEG) headsets which have significantly less recording channels and far lower signal resolution commonly called “Wearable EEG” as opposed to medical-grade EEG headsets with the ultimate goal of applying EEG-based emotion prediction to procedurally-generated affective content such as immersive computer games and virtual learning environments through machine learning. Our prior preliminary study has found that the use of a 4-channel, 256-Hz was indeed able to perform the required emotion recognition tasks from VR stimuli albeit at classification rates of between 65-89% classification accuracy only using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers. For this particular study, we attempt to improve the classification rates to above 95% by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the use of various deep neural-based learning architectures for this domain. By tuning the deep neural classifiers in terms of the number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes and the nodal dropout ratio, the emotion prediction accuracy was able to be improved to over 96%. This shows the continued promise of the application of wearable EEG for emotion prediction as a cost-effective and userfriendly approach for consistent and reliable prediction deployment in virtual reality-related content and environments through deep learning approaches.","","978-1-5386-4838-4","10.1109/ICSCEE.2018.8538382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8538382","electroencephalography;emotion recognition;machine learning;virtual reality;wearable EEG.","Electroencephalography;Virtual reality;Emotion recognition;Headphones;Electrodes;Feature extraction;Reliability","electroencephalography;emotion recognition;medical signal processing;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines;virtual reality","recording channels;medical-grade EEG headsets;virtual learning environments;machine learning;VR stimuli;classification rates;deep neural classifiers;emotion prediction accuracy;reliable prediction deployment;virtual reality-related content;deep learning approaches;eeg-based emotion recognition;immersive environments;artificial general intelligence applications;video stimuli;virtual reality stimuli;signal resolution;computer games;K-nearest neighbor classifiers;image stimuli;emotion recognition;electroencephalography headsets;support vector machines;wearable EEG","","","","17","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an important class of function approximation techniques, kernel methods have been recently applied to improve the generalization ability of RL and ADP methods but most previous works were only based on simulation. This paper focuses on experimental studies of real-time online learning control for nonlinear systems using kernel-based ADP methods. Specifically, the kernel-based dual heuristic programming (KDHP) method is applied and tested on real-time control systems. Two kernel-based online learning control schemes are presented for uncertain nonlinear systems by using simulation data and online sampling data, respectively. Learning control experiments were performed on a single-link inverted pendulum system as well as a double-link inverted pendulum system. From the experimental results, it is shown that both online learning control schemes, either using simulation data or using real sampling data, are effective for approximating near-optimal control policies of nonlinear dynamical systems with model uncertainties. In addition, it is demonstrated that KDHP can achieve better performance than conventional DHP, which uses multilayer perceptron neural networks.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2013.2246866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6492103","Approximate dynamic programming (ADP);learning control;Markov decision processes (MDPs);online learning;reinforcement learning (RL)","","dynamic programming;function approximation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;Markov processes;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;pendulums;sampling methods;uncertain systems","kernel-based approximate dynamic programming;realtime online learning control;learning control methods;reinforcement learning;RL;function approximation techniques;generalization ability;kernel-based ADP methods;kernel-based dual heuristic programming;KDHP method;uncertain nonlinear systems;single-link inverted pendulum system;double-link inverted pendulum system;sampling data;near-optimal control policies;model uncertainties;multilayer perceptron neural networks","","46","","33","","2 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This architecture can be used to simulate three environments that are: a) Driver's environment; b) Pedestrian environment; c) Vehicle traffic observer environment. All these environments are controlled by intelligent agents that allow the user to handle the autonomous longitudinal control, the relative distance, the speed of the cars, the collisions between vehicles, the pedestrian collision, excess of the speed limit, circulation in the opposite direction, and respect of traffic signals.

In the context of reinforcement learning, the learning rate controls how fast we modify our estimates. Generally Q-learning approach leverages the temporal-difference (TD) error to regulate Q-value, while utilizing a constant or decreasing learning rate, e.g., linear or polynomial learning rate, throughout the agent's life. Learning algorithm with polynomial learning rate learns faster at the cost of inferior trade-off between exploration and exploitation. None of them is evaluated based on the TD error. Whereas that cannot psychologically reflect the agent's true learning progress with unnecessary extra training episodes and exploration. This paper proposes an error-sensitive learning rate mechanism for Q-learning algorithm termed as (ESQL) to achieve better mitigation and faster learning. The agent is endowed sensibility to the TD error summed over the episodes. The derived method is implemented with indoor robot navigation task simulation in a stationary grid world environment. Experimental results are presented showing that ESQL approach achieves faster learning and latent better trade-off between exploration and exploitation compared with both constant and decreasing learning rate Q-learning approaches.","1934-1768","978-9-8815-6389-7","10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7260552","Reinforcement learning;Error-sensitive;Learning rate;TD error;Q-learning;Robot navigation","Learning (artificial intelligence);Training;Robots;Navigation;Polynomials;Machine learning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms","indoor navigation;learning systems;mobile robots;path planning","error-sensitive Q-learning approach;reinforcement learning;temporal-difference error;TD error;linear learning;polynomial learning;ESQL;indoor robot navigation task simulation;stationary grid world environment","","1","","17","","14 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter times for the development of different training-scenarios as well as reuse of existing designed engineering (math) models. This paper presents a newly developed virtual environment (VE) for training of procedure tasks i.e. object assembly. Unlike existing VE systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations of the real world. These physical constrains are imposed by the haptics devices in the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VE systems that are capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in cognitive learning and procedural skill development due to its high physically interactive nature. In addition a novel evaluation framework has also been proposed to evaluate system efficacy through a large scale of user-testing, which is often been neglected by design experts in the field of VEs. Results confirm the practical significance of evaluating a VE design by involving sample of real and representative users through the effective discovery of critical usability problems and system deficiencies. Results also indicate benefits of collecting multimodal information for accurate and comprehensive assessment of system efficacy. Evaluation results and improvement of existing design are also presented.","","978-1-4244-4217-1","10.1109/HAVE.2009.5356130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356130","Virtual environment;Training;User-ecntred evaluation;Performance;Perception;Memory","Virtual environment;Assembly systems;Industrial training;Haptic interfaces;Manufacturing industries;Costs;Usability;Computer aided manufacturing;Feedback;Intelligent manufacturing systems","assembling;computer based training;haptic interfaces;human factors;industrial training;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;virtual reality","virtual environment;object assembly training;virtual training systems;manufacturing industry;user interaction;haptics devices;user-testing;user-centered evaluation;cognitive learning;procedural skill development","","7","","16","","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some platforms allow synchronous communication between the tutor and the student, i.e., the tutoring process takes place at a predetermined time, simulating conventional training. Asynchronous educational platforms enable the student to study and solve exercises in the time and at the pace of their own choice. However, there are questions about users' data, especially considering the General Data Protection Regulation 1 (GDPR) in force since 25 May 2018. In this article, we describe the features that distinguish synchronous from asynchronous learning systems and identify their points of impact with specific GDPR elements, respectively. Particularly for the asynchronous method, we focus on platforms that process user data and appropriately adapt the educational material. Having identified the impact points, we address the issue by providing guidelines for similar system designers.

"Cyber-Hero: A Gamification framework for Cyber Security Awareness for High Schools Students","H. Qusa; J.

The increasing numbers of cyber-attacks indicate that the traditional methodologies of training and awareness are still insufficient to build the necessary cybersecurity skills and capabilities. Gamification represents a promising methodology to change the behavior of people in the early stages. The objective of this research is not only to verify the effectiveness of gamification but also to provide a constructive application and to propose a framework that helps eventually and iteratively in improving the cyber-security skills and capabilities for high school students in early stages. In this research, we propose a novel framework for information security awareness and training programs, known as Cyber-Hero, that will help fight one of the most popular weaknesses in cybersecurity which is human error. The framework helps in transferring the learning of a narrative set of instructions to be acquired in a serious game, in which students in schools can engage with at an early stage. Such an engagement will educate students on how to create a strong password to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. The preliminary results show incremental progress in the skills and capabilities of cybersecurity for the students using the proposed framework.","","978-1-6654-1490-6","10.1109/CCWC51732.2021.9375847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9375847","Cybersecurity Simulations;Cybersecurity Exercises;Gamification;Awareness Campaign;Training Platform","Training;Conferences;Information security;Games;Computer crime;Password;Information systems","","","","","","27","","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Sim2Real Viewpoint Invariant Visual Servoing by Recurrent Control","F. Sadeghi; A. Toshev; E. Jang; S. Levine",NA; NA; NA; NA,"2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","16 Dec 2018","2018","","","4691","4699","Humans are remarkably proficient at controlling their limbs and tools from a wide range of viewpoints. In robotics, this ability is referred to as visual servoing: moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual feedback. In this paper, we propose learning viewpoint invariant visual servoing skills in a robot manipulation task. We train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine which actions move the end-effector of a robotic arm to a desired object. This problem is fundamentally ambiguous: under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing approach uses its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to previous visual servoing methods, which assume known dynamics or require a calibration phase. We learn our recurrent controller using simulated data, synthetic demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We then describe how the resulting model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from control and only adapting the visual layers. The adapted model can servo to previously unseen objects from novel viewpoints on a real-world Kuka IIWA robotic arm.

This study devotes to improving the performance for cloud service platforms by minimizing uncertainty propagation in scheduling workflow applications that have both uncertain task execution time and data transfer time. To be specific, a novel scheduling architecture is designed to control the count of workflow tasks directly waiting on each service instance (e.g., virtual machine). Based on this architecture, we develop an unceRtainty-aware Online Scheduling Algorithm (ROSA) to schedule dynamic and multiple workflows with deadlines. The proposed ROSA skillfully integrates both the proactive and reactive strategies. Then, on the basis of real-world workflow traces, five groups of simulation experiments are carried out to compare ROSA with five typical algorithms. The comparison results reveal that ROSA performs better than the five compared algorithms with respect to costs (up to 56%), deviation (up to 70%), resource utilization (up to 37%) and fairness (up to 37).","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2018.2866421","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443134","workflow scheduling;uncertain;proactive and reactive strategies;cloud service","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Data transfer;Uncertainty;Schedules;Computer architecture;Scheduling","","","","17","","","","21 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recently-introduced automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) systems have a potential to decrease user dependency due to its automated scanning protocols. However, the current ABUS system suffers from the limited field-of-view (FOV) and the long scanning time. In this paper, a new automated breast ultrasound system with dual wide field-of-view imaging is presented. In the developed ABUS system, two 1024-element wide field-of-view linear array transducers are used for accelerating scanning time. To support dual wide transducers, two 1024-to-128 high-voltage multiplexing board and four transmit/ receive boards were embedded. The beamformed radio-frequency data are transferred to a PC module via a PCI express 2.0 interface, and then mid and back-end processing is conducted by a graphics processing unit using CUDA. This system can acquire a 3D breast volume set with 20 cm (width) × 25 cm (length) × 8 cm (depth) within 20 seconds. The further evaluation of the developed ABUS system including pre-clinical studies is under investigation.

In several classes of applications which typically involve RT level oriented design approach, these components can circumvent various issues related to synthesis of multifunctional circuits at the gate level. While the synthesis at the gate level is difficult, at RT level a skilled designer is still able to design a far more complex circuits by himself. If a set of efficient bi-functional RTL components is available, their utilization is expected to improve efficiency of the resulting circuit. In this paper, validity of this assumption is demonstrated through a design of bi-functional adder/subtractor circuit. At the gate level, one-bit full adder/subtractor circuit was created and optimised. This circuit was subsequently utilised for design of multi-bit adder/subtractor which was successfully simulated at the transistor level with MOSFET implementation of bi-functional logic gates.

However, some practical factors in 3C assembly line, such as the mechanical diversities between the human body and the robot, make it difficult to apply PbD methods. Motivated by that, with a subtly designed demonstration data extraction platform and a posture mapping strategy, this article proposes a PbD method that transforms human assembly skill to the robot for 3C assembly tasks.

We enhance planning performance by exploiting problem structure in several ways: First, we simplify the search over plans by leveraging knowledge of skill objectives; second, shorter plans are generated by enforcing aggressively hierarchical planning; and third, we learn transition dynamics with sparse local models for better generalization. Our framework decomposes transition dynamics into skill effects and success conditions, which allows fast planning by reasoning on effects, while learning conditions from interactions with the world. We propose a simple method for learning new abstract skills, using successful trajectories stemming from completing the goals of a curriculum. Learned skills are then refined to leverage other abstract skills and enhance subsequent planning. We show that both conditions and abstract skills can be learned simultaneously while planning, even in stochastic domains. Our method is validated in experiments of increasing complexity, with up to 2100 states, showing superior planning to classic non-hierarchical planners or reinforcement learning methods.

From the experiment of visual target tracking, the tracking trajectories recorded from both healthy persons and patients with movement disability were analyzed. It was found that the tracking trajectories were represented sufficiently by a dynamic model of a robot arm in which the differences between healthy persons and patients were characterized by the model parameters. Based on the model, it was demonstrated that the hand movement of patients could be improved by introducing an appropriate compensation.

These methods typically build generative models from demonstrations and then use regression to reproduce skills. However, this approach has limitations to capture hard geometric constraints imposed by the task. On the other hand, while sampling and optimization-based motion planners exist that reason about geometric constraints, these are typically carefully hand-crafted by an expert. To address this technical gap, we contribute with C-LEARN, a method that learns multi-step manipulation tasks from demonstrations as a sequence of keyframes and a set of geometric constraints. The system builds a knowledge base for reaching and grasping objects, which is then leveraged to learn multi-step tasks from a single demonstration. C-LEARN supports multi-step tasks with multiple end effectors; reasons about SE(3) volumetric and CAD constraints, such as the need for two axes to be parallel; and offers a principled way to transfer skills between robots with different kinematics. We embed the execution of the learned tasks within a shared autonomy framework, and evaluate our approach by analyzing the success rate when performing physical tasks with a dual-arm Optimas robot, comparing the contribution of different constraints models, and demonstrating the ability of C-LEARN to transfer learned tasks by performing them with a legged dual-arm Atlas robot in simulation.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989466","","Planning;Solid modeling;Knowledge based systems;Grasping;Hidden Markov models;End effectors","control engineering computing;end effectors;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);legged locomotion;manipulator kinematics;path planning;regression analysis;sampling methods","C-LEARN;learning geometric constraints;multistep manipulation;shared autonomy;regression;sampling-based motion planners;optimization-based motion planners;knowledge base;multistep tasks;end effectors;robot kinematics;dual-arm Optimas robot;legged dual-arm Atlas robot","","10","","31","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous research, most of them employed model-based method which requires robot model in advance. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to obtain the precise mathematical model of robots. Moreover, the computer installed on the space robot is usually not so powerful due to the restriction of weight and volume, thus it is infeasible to computer dynamics parameters for real-time control. To facilitate the computation complexity, we present an approach based on human learning skill for tracking and catching objects. With human-teaching demonstration, the space robot is able to learn and abstract human tracking and capturing skill using an efficient neural-network learning architecture that combines flexible cascade neural networks with node-decoupled extended kalman filtering (CNN-NDEKF). The goal of skill learning is to obtain the most likely human performance from all the training examples and to transfer this skill to the space robot system by trained cascade neural network. We investigate the learning position trajectory in Cartesian space and position trajectory in Joint space respectively. Especially, learning position trajectory in joint space is useful to avoid the complex inverse kinematics of space robot and to lower the computation cost. The simulation results attest that this approach is useful and feasible in tracking trajectory planning and capturing of space robot. The proposed approach provides a feasible way to plan the tracking trajectory of space robot by learning human demonstration skill. The learning is significant in eliminating sluggish motion planning and correcting a motion command that the operator may mistakenly generate. It would be found useful in various other applications, such as human action recognition in man-machine interfaces, real-time training, and agile manufacturing.","","0-7803-9303-1","10.1109/ICIA.2005.1635083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635083","","Humans;Orbital robotics;Neural networks;Trajectory;Motion planning;Intelligent robots;Mathematical model;Computer architecture;Kalman filters;Filtering","aerospace robotics;robot kinematics;neural nets;tracking;path planning;student experiments;computational complexity","human intelligence;space object capturing;model-based method;computer dynamics parameter;real-time control;computation complexity;human learning skill;object tracking;object catching;human-teaching demonstration;neural-network learning architecture;cascade neural network;node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering;CNN-NDEKF;space robot system;Cartesian space;position trajectory;inverse kinematics;motion planning","","2","","17","","30 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These formulations have been developed by skillful SAR and RCS experts; - an original geometrical algorithm which handles the various facets visibility, including the multiple inner reflections and the interaction with the object surroundings (i.e. ground). SAR images are typically produced in a matter of minutes, using a 2D SAR radar transfer function that takes into account the main parameters of SAR image quality (resolution, Nesigmadeg, tapering). Many studies suffer from the lack of SAR images or control on SAR image content. This tool will interest scientists and labs, working on SAR image features extraction and SAR image analysis.

In combat information centres (CIC) of Navy ships operational data about objects in the environment are processed in a complex command and control cycle. Due to different task domains and an increasing performance of both modern sensors and data transfer, the command and control processes are characterized by high complexity that might affect the operators' workload and consequently the error rate in the workflow. One approach to improve this situation may be the use of assistance systems. In addition, the lack of competency and skills or the absence of the qualified operators caused by demographic changes will make assistance systems indispensable in the future. In a simulation study a cognitive assistance system (COGAS) is being developed for supporting the crew, and especially the decision maker, of a CIC during air target identification. COGAS contains two supporting modules called cognitive units, which are combined to fulfill its support functions by means of flexible automation. Both cognitive units are based on Rasmussen's Decision Ladder which describes the behavior of well-trained and motivated operators controlling complex dynamic systems. This article outlines the functional structure of COGAS and its cognitive units. Both units contain a memory of a-priori knowledge, a memory of present situation knowledge, and activities for processing data. The structure of supporting cognitive units, which comprise modules of the relevant system environment and system goals, as well as possible system tasks and actions, is described in some detail. In order to simulate CIC working processes with or without COGAS, we utilized the Integrated Performance Modeling Environment (IPME). IPME provides model components which represent the activities of the system, COGAS and the operator in the form of task networks. IPME also helps to analyze human performance in highly complex systems and provides models for determining operator workload. This paper describes the development of COGAS components and their IPME implementation.","","978-1-4673-2437-3","10.1109/CogSIMA.2013.6523819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523819","Cognitive assistance systems;flexible automation;process simulation;Integrated Performance Modeling Environment (IPME);human-machine-systems","Automation;Process control;Sensors;Marine vehicles;Information processing;Command and control systems;Error analysis","command and control systems","simulation-based development;cognitive assistance system;navy ship;cognitive technology;combat information center;CIC;command-and-control cycle;COGAS;Rasmussen decision ladder;integrated performance modeling environment;IPME","","1","","23","","6 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the learnability of touch gestures as a computer interaction modality cannot be taken for granted and should be evaluated empirically. This is especially true when technology-naïve older adults are concerned, given the psychological and physical constraints associated with this age range. To investigate this issue, we conducted a study with 17 technology-naïve older adults, whose experience with technology was mostly limited to making calls with mobile phones. Specifically, the participants were presented with three simple digital games on an interactive tabletop surface and asked to play the games on their own with minimal instruction or help. The first two games required the use of a drag gesture whereas the third game required the use of a rotate gesture. The main research question was whether the older adults could learn the gestures effectively and efficiently. A set of variables such as task duration and gesture accuracy were measured. Results showed that the learnability of a drag gesture was relatively high and that the participants could transfer this skill across the games. In contrast, the learnability of a rotate gesture was low and most of the participants failed to demonstrate any improvement over the tasks of the game. These findings partially corroborate those of earlier work. Implications for future work are drawn, especially exploring the potential of social interactions between older adults for enhancing the learning effects.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iwu044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8212636","intuitive interaction;learnability;gestural input;touch-screen;interactive surface;senior users","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Proceedings of the","26 Feb 2004","2004","","","9 pp.","","The value of collaboration as a tool to promote learning is becoming increasingly more evident. Students engaged in collaborative efforts typically retain the information being learned longer by becoming more actively engaged in the learning activity. There is evidence that collaborative activities foster higher-order thinking skills such as analytical reasoning, synthesis, and evaluation. Furthermore, students work in an environment that better prepares them to meet the challenges inherent in succeeding in the workforce. Constructivism in the form of project-based learning has likewise been shown to foster increased retention of material and greater depth of learning. When combined with collaborative assignments, students have demonstrated greater retention and enhanced capability of transferring concepts to practice. Promoting collaboration in a classroom setting is difficult and often resisted by both teachers and students. This difficulty is magnified for courses offered in an online learning environment. Although there are a number of applications available to enable real-time communication, the immediacy and intimacy of person-to-person interaction is difficult to replace. The non-verbal cues that comprise a large part of everyday communication are largely lost through even the richest online environment. As a result, educators are faced with a dilemma: both students and academic institutions are flocking towards courses offered via an asynchronous learning network, but there is no clear understanding of how to foster collaboration, one of the most promising pedagogical tools. Although asynchronous online environments certainly lack the intimacy and immediacy inherent in face-to-face settings and simulated to an extent by synchronous applications, meaningful collaborative assignments are still possible. The proposed paper details a five-step systems approach for fostering project-based, collaborative learning in an asynchronous learning environment. The steps are illustrated with examples from a graduate-level course in multimedia systems in which asynchronous collaboration was a featured assignment.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265065","","Collaborative work;Collaborative tools;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Multimedia systems;Educational institutions;Information analysis;International collaboration","distance learning;groupware;educational courses","asynchronous collaborative learning;collaborative activities;higher-order thinking skills;project-based learning;collaborative assignments;online learning;real-time communication;nonverbal cues;academic institutions;asynchronous learning network;asynchronous online environments;graduate-level course;multimedia systems","","18","","25","","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of this vision is to support human creative processes by augmenting them with technology, enhancing creativity and tackling the blind spots, for example, head-on. We envision the CCO as an open and flexible area, indoors or outdoors, which can fit or emerge anywhere/anytime/anyhow. It can be a room, a space, a yard, a public space or simply a floor. An oasis can be made from a range of available artifacts (e.g. chairs, tables, walls, dividers, screens, whiteboards, cardboard boxes etc.) or could stay bare, each eventually being populated with actors/users and/or stakeholders.

Compared to the versatile strategies of handling disturbances of human, current bipedal robots possess limited skills of managing external disturbances. Among them the capabilities of push recovery and maintaining balance are obviously of prior importance for a bipedal robot to walk in an unknown environment. Existing solutions, such as, capture point, walking phase modification, foot placement estimator and etc, are mostly based on simplifying a bipedal robot as a linear inverted pendulum, which result in omitting the effects of knee and ankle joints, natural dynamics, ground reaction forces and interaction between joints in sagittal and frontal planes in a 3D bipedal robot. To overcome those drawbacks, this paper presents a work that it classifies push types, presents a push detector, and proposes control strategies for managing continuous strong pushes occurring during walking. Based on biological and biomechanical research, more efficient strategies, e. g., hip and ankle strategy, a bent-knee strategy, can be transferred to control methods for bipeds. Through generating required torques and/or regulating joint positions in order to stabilize bipedal robot, a push recovery controller is proposed in this paper. Simulation results demonstrate that a 3D physically simulated anthropomorphic biped with 21 degrees of freedom can succeed in recovering from a strong push of up to 200 N during walking in different walking scenarios.","","978-1-4799-2744-9","10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6739637","","Knee;Joints;Legged locomotion;Hip;Foot;Torque","biomechanics;legged locomotion;pendulums;robot dynamics","biologically motivated push recovery strategy;3D bipedal robot walking;complex environments;human walking;versatile strategy;bipedal robots;capture point;walking phase modification;foot placement estimator;linear inverted pendulum;knee joint;ankle joint;natural dynamics;ground reaction force;sagittal plane;frontal plane;push detector;control strategy;biological research;biomechanical research;bent-knee strategy;push recovery controller;3D physically simulated anthropomorphic biped","","6","","17","","17 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Haptic feedback has been proposed as a means to provide additional guidance cues that might improve training efficacy; however, recent studies have identified drawbacks to haptic guidance, including reliance on guidance forces and an inability to distinguish between forces that are part of the virtual environment and those that communicate task completion strategies. Recently, we proposed a novel approach to providing haptic guidance that separates task and guidance forces. We used a kinesthetic haptic interface to communicate task forces and a spatially separated tactile skin-stretch device to transmit guidance forces. Our experiments showed that feed-forward control using this paradigm was effective for improving performance in a trajectory following task. In this paper, we explore the potential for spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance to train a user to optimally control an inverted pendulum system. We present and execute a task and training protocol designed to determine whether error-based haptic feedback provided cutaneously can accelerate learning of a task, and whether participants can retain or transfer task skills even after guidance is no longer present. We found that subject performance improved while spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance was active. Despite this finding, performance in the pendulum balancing task was not affected once the haptic assistance was removed.","2324-7355","978-1-7281-0234-4","10.1109/HAPTICS45997.2020.ras.HAP20.11.2032900c","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086314","","","feedforward;haptic interfaces;pendulums;virtual reality","spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance;virtual sensorimotor task;haptic devices;virtual environments;guidance cues;guidance forces;kinesthetic haptic interface;task forces;spatially separated tactile skin-stretch device;error-based haptic feedback;haptic assistance;multimodal feedback;feed-forward control;inverted pendulum system","","","","27","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major problem is the quantification of both training and performance. The case of a swimmer is studied in detail. It is shown that if a time series of training impulses is used as input, his performance in 100 m criterion performances can be modeled rather well with a simple linear system. The major conclusion is that performance appears to be related to the difference between fitness and fatigue functions. The fitness function is related to training by a first-order system with time constant 50 days, whereas the fatigue function is related to training by a similar system with time constant 15 days. An appendix is provided to show how these systems can be simulated on a simple electronic calculator.

It has been shown, however, that providing both task forces and guidance forces simultaneously through the same haptic interface can lead to novices depending on guidance, being unable to demonstrate skill transfer, or learning the wrong task altogether. This paper presents a novel solution whereby task forces are relayed via a kinesthetic haptic interface, while guidance forces are spatially separated through a cutaneous skin stretch modality. We explore different methods of delivering cutaneous based guidance to subjects in a dynamic trajectory following task. We next compare cutaneous guidance to kinesthetic guidance, as is traditional to spatially separated assistance. We further investigate the role of placing cutaneous guidance ipsilateral versus contralateral to the task force device. The efficacies of each guidance condition are compared by examining subject error and movement smoothness.

Virtualizing deployment of deep learning models can facilitate large-scale use/re-use of off-the-shelf functional behaviors. Deploying deep learning models on robots entails real-time, accurate and reliable inference service under varying query load. This letter introduces a novel Robot-Inference-and-Learning-as-a-Service (RILaaS) platform for low-latency and secure inference serving of deep models that can be deployed on robots. Unique features of RILaaS include: 1) low-latency and reliable serving with gRPC under dynamic loads by distributing queries over multiple servers on Edge and Cloud, 2) SSH based authentication coupled with SSL/TLS based encryption for security and privacy of the data, and 3) front-end REST API for sharing, monitoring and visualizing performance metrics of the available models. We report experiments to evaluate the RILaaS platform under varying loads of batch size, number of robots, and various model placement hosts on Cloud, Edge, and Fog for providing benchmark applications of object recognition and grasp planning as a service. We address the complexity of load balancing with a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes simulated profiles of networked robots; outperforming several baselines including round robin, least connections, and least model time with 68.30% and 14.04% decrease in round-trip latency time across models compared to the worst and the next best baseline respectively.

Using evolutionary computing methods, the neural network based controllers were evolved to play the competitive team game Capture the Flag with teams of mobile robots. Neural controllers were evolved in simulation and transferred to real robots for physical verification. Sensor signals in the simulated environment are formatted to duplicate the processed real video sensor values rather than the raw video images. Robot controllers receive sensor signals and send actuator commands of the same format, whether they are driving physical robots in a real environment or simulated robots agents in an artificial environment.

Given a set of parameterized skills (such as exerting a force or doing a top grasp at a location), our goal is to learn policies that invoke these skills to efficiently solve such tasks. Our insight is that for many tasks, the learning process can be decomposed into learning a state-independent task schema (a sequence of skills to execute) and a policy to choose the parameterizations of the skills in a state-dependent manner. For such tasks, we show that explicitly modeling the schema's state-independence can yield significant improvements in sample efficiency for model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, these schemas can be transferred to solve related tasks, by simply re-learning the parameterizations with which the skills are invoked.

The transfer of this type of surgical skill to novices is a challenging issue. This paper presents a study on the design of a biopsy procedure learning system. Our methodology, based on a task-centered design approach, aims to bring out new design rules for virtual learning environments. A new collaborative haptic training paradigm is introduced to support human-haptic interaction in a virtual environment. The interaction paradigm supports haptic communication between two distant users to teach a surgical skill. In order to evaluate this paradigm, a user experiment was conducted. Sixty volunteer medical students participated in the study to assess the influence of the teaching method on their performance in a biopsy procedure task. The results show that to transfer the skills, the combination of haptic communication with verbal and visual communications improves the novices’ performance compared to conventional teaching methods. Furthermore, the results show that, depending on the teaching method, participants developed different needle insertion profiles. We conclude that our interaction paradigm facilitates expert-novice haptic communication and improves skills transfer; and new skills acquisition depends on the availability of different communication channels between experts and novices. Our findings indicate that the traditional fellowship methods in surgery should evolve to an off-patient collaborative environment that will continue to support visual and verbal communication, but also haptic communication, in order to achieve a better and more complete skills training.","1054-7460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797456","","","","","","4","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Grant","Turing Inst., Glasgow, UK","IEE Colloquium on Intelligent Control","6 Aug 2002","1991","","","111","114","To tackle real-world control problems using expert behaviour, an expert controller with learning capabilities must be built, so that the expert can transfer skill by a tutorial process of showing examples. That is, the machine must be able to build up its skill in the domain automatically in the form of appropriate control actions triggered by the sensed state variables. In machine learning adaptive control the control scheme is independent of the mathematical modelling of the object dynamics and the precise estimation of its physical parameters. The article presents the authors own work, and that of others, on rules for controlling dynamic systems, and for designing robust rule-based controllers, efficient and adaptable, that has been applied in numerous simulations and to physical process control. The work reported catalogues experiments into intelligent control by human-supervised learning, passive learning, and machine learning. The work started with observing human-supervised learning, these observations led to the development of generalised rules for an automatic controller. Later, when this controller was applied to the physical system, the sensed outputs were post-processed by the c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm to demonstrate passive learning. Passive learning of this type provided feedback and allowed a direct comparison to be made between human and machine generated rules.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=181122","","Adaptive control;Digital control;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems","adaptive control;computerised control;knowledge based systems;learning systems","intelligent control;skill transfer;efficient control design;expert controller;machine learning adaptive control;robust rule-based controllers;human-supervised learning;passive learning;c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm;feedback","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The controlling approach should consider two main factors which are minimizing the moving time of the payload from the primary pick up point to the destination point and second, the oscillation of the payload must be reduced to prevent hazards for people and equipment in the workplace. These days, instead of skillful crane operator, a lot of controllers have designed for the purpose of minimizing angle of swing as well as obtaining precise positioning. However, still each of them has some limitations and an enhanced controller is necessary with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the rotary crane system. In this research, input shaping technique, a technique of convolving the impulse sequences, an input shaper, with the command signal of the system is implemented into the rotary crane system. The outcome of the convolution is then being used as the reference command to drive the system. The inputs for the system are the position and the angle of swing that are being detected by the encoder and potentiometer. These inputs are converted into digital signal by the means of DAQ card. Then, after they are being manipulated with the design input shaper in the MATLAB simulation software, the simulation model will then be connected to the real system by using the XPC Target. The execution of the MATLAB simulation on the target PC will result in reduced angle of swing of the rotary crane system. This project is very significant due to fact that it brings an improvement in controlling the angle of swing of the rotary crane and minimizes the time needed to move the payload.","","978-1-4673-0479-5","10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6271207","rotary crane;playload;pick up point;destination point","Cranes;Vibrations;Transfer functions;Poles and towers;Mathematical model;Control systems;Equations","control system synthesis;cranes;data acquisition;encoding;potentiometers","rotary crane system;load transportation;payload moving time minimization;input shaping technique;impulse sequences;input shaper;encoder;potentiometer;digital signal;DAQ card;MATLAB simulation software;XPC target;angle of swing control;data acquisition","","1","","9","","20 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In SWE the objectives are to apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to the procedural and object-oriented C# programming skills in order to implement code with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this laboratory the GUI allows the user to enter the values that represent the coefficients of a polynomial. The results of the GUI return whether the polynomial represents a stable or unstable system. In CCS the objectives are modeling the physical system and applying the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to analyze the closed loop system performance. In this lab students determine the mathematical model for an antenna azimuth position control system. They then apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to find all proportional gains for the controllers that meet certain performance requirements for the antenna position control system.

As open forms of teaching we used blended learning, open space technology (OST) and selected elements of gamification. Game-based learning approaches posit that learners who interact with educational materials with playful and dynamic tasks will learn better. To better understand improvement of teamwork, social skills and collaboration a specific business game with a defined amount of play tokens is introduced. Within this business game all participants (n = 22) will have to form interdisciplinary project teams to manage a professional 3D-visualization task. In three subsequent project stages (concept, development and implementation) all projects are continually evaluated and the teams are appropriately rewarded with play tokens. With these play tokens every team can purchase missing know-how or hire additional workforce. The final visualization project is evaluated by specific design criteria (qualitative) and by the remaining amount of play tokens (quantitative). The concept of a business game was a visible success. Open forms of teaching, such as blended learning and open space technology promote the active acquisition of basic knowledge, technical understanding and at least increase transfer competence. A continuous and transparent evaluation makes the individual learning progress directly tangible. Students who took part in the business game reported more enjoyment in learning the 3D visualization pipeline than students from the years before. The business game induced greater interest to the students in acquiring new content more easily and quickly than in the other courses.

By developing such a VISIR federation some of the constraints of using remote labs, the ones associated with development and maintenance costs, and scalability, will be minimized. This paper aims to present the initial steps for developing a VISIR Federation, which is also the primary goal of PILAR - Platform Integration of Laboratories based on the Architecture of visiR project.","","978-1-5386-0810-4","10.1109/EXPAT.2017.7984403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7984403","VISIR;federation;remote labs","Education;Hardware;Laboratories;Tools;Buildings;Collaboration;Europe","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;engineering education;groupware;virtual reality","VISIR federation;PILAR experience;collaborative working;know-how transfer;institutional management;European initiatives;engineering education;European universities;remote system;virtual instruments system in reality;remote labs;maintenance costs;PILAR;platform integration of laboratories based on the architecture of VISIR project","","","","12","","20 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning to coordinate with other people requires a long training time and is often limited by the difficulty of having people available at the same time and of giving them accurate and real-time feedback about their coordination. The goal of the present study was to determine in an indoor team rowing situation whether virtual-reality and motion-capture technologies can help the acquisition of interpersonal coordination. More specifically, we investigated the possibility for participants to (1) learn the skill of interpersonal coordination when training with a virtual teammate, (2) accelerate learning with real-time visual feedback, and (3) transfer this skill to synchronizing situations with a real teammate. Our results show that participants improved their coordination with both virtual and real teammates, and that this improvement was better for participants who received the feedback. Generally, our results demonstrate the interest of virtual reality for learning the coordination with other people; further, our results open promising training perspectives for team rowing but also for several other interpersonal activities.","1054-7460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818592","","","","","","1","","","","20 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

One possible solution is imitation based meta-learning, but most of the related approaches are limited in a particular network structure or a specific task. Particularly, meta-learning methods based on gradient-update are prone to overfit. In this article, we propose a generic meta-learning algorithm that divides the learning process into two independent stages (skill cloning and skill transfer) with a noise mechanism which is compatible with any model. The skill cloning stage enables a good understanding of the demonstration, which helps the skill transfer stage when the robot applies the learned experience into new tasks. The experimental results show that our algorithm can alleviate the phenomenon of overfitting by introducing a noise mechanism. Our method not only performs well on the regression task but is significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art one-shot imitation learning methods in the same simulation environments (i.e., simulated pushing and simulated reaching).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029220","Jihua Laboratory of China through the Self-Programming Intelligent Robot Project; Forward-Looking Research Project on the Basic Theory and Key Technology of Ternary-Space Swarm Intelligence; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of AI and Robotics; Engineering Research Center of AI and Robotics, Ministry of Education, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9214823","Learning to learn;meta-learning;one-shot imitation learning;robot learning","Task analysis;Adaptation models;Robots;Cloning;Training;Learning (artificial intelligence);Animals","humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs)","stage model-agnostic meta-learning;noise mechanism;one-shot imitation;effective demonstration;imitation based meta-learning;meta-learning methods;generic meta-learning algorithm;learning process;independent stages;skill cloning stage;skill transfer stage;learned experience;network structure","","","","43","CCBY","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To simulate these efforts, we have developed an app game that uses musical therapy techniques to teach simple tapping sequences to participants. Seven unique tapping sequences with varying levels of difficulty were taught to 208 participants. Two performance metrics were measured: (1) how quickly participants learned the correct number of taps in the sequence and (2) how quickly participants learned the correct frequency to tap the sequence. The first performance metric is a counting task, which is a cognitive function. The second performance metric is the speed at which the participant must move, which is a motor function. The results of our experiment show that when the difficulty of the tapping sequence was adjusted, participants learned the cognitive portion of the task more quickly when the task was simpler and the motor portion of the task more quickly when the task was more difficult. These trends were statistically significant with p-values <; 0.05. Our experiment suggests that in context of teaching a simple tapping sequence, participants are multitasking cognitive and motor aspects of the task, as they multitask motor and cognitive skills while learning rehabilitation exercises in therapeutic settings. If these benefits could be transferred to a stroke survivor population in a therapeutic setting, an expedited recovery could be realized by stroke survivors, allowing them to regain motor functions, and therefore daily living activities, more quickly.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285396","","Task analysis;Medical treatment;Games;Rhythm;Robots;Multitasking","biomechanics;cognition;computer games;music;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation","app game development;learning rehabilitation exercises;therapeutic settings;cognitive skills;motor aspects;motor portion;cognitive portion;motor function;cognitive function;counting task;performance metric;seven unique tapping sequences;simple tapping sequence;musical therapy techniques;therapy sessions;motor skills;musical techniques;multitasking task;cognitive aspects","","","","29","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The trainees, through simulations, learn to manage the power system during real-time operations and assess on-line dynamic security through the adoption of suitable corrective actions in emergency conditions. Usually, trainees learn only from the experience acquired during the simulation sessions. The OTS is also aimed at improving operator training by adding to the experiential learning the tacit knowledge acquired by senior control center operators. The tacit knowledge can be made explicit and transferred to trainees through well-suited OTS sessions including case studies based on past performed senior operator experiences.

A categorisation of the identified serious games was developed in order to analyse the characteristics of the serious games - the aspects they covered and those they do not cover. Of primary importance were the simulation level, topic and skills mediated by the identified serious games. The ""simulation level"" means the level or amount of the world that is simulated in the simulation or serious game. This is a hierarchy starting with the World/ God/ Universe - in which level whole worlds are simulated, for example, in games such as Civilization. The hierarchy then proceeds downwards from nation, industry, inter-organisational, business/ organisation, intra-organisational/ processes, group/ team, discipline, techniques to games addressing the individual. Second the skills to be transferred by the serious game were also analysed. From this an analysis of the gaps in coverage of serious games was carried out, leading to identifying opportunities for, and recommendations of, serious games to be developed for the business and industry domain.","","978-3-943024-05-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6041266","Serious Games;State of the Art;Training;Business and Industry","Games;Business;Industries;Production;Training;Computers;Computational modeling","business data processing;computer games","Serious Game;GALA;state of the art analysis;industry domain;business domain;simulation level","","2","","17","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, using PCA transformation the significant Tri Mean-RAP features are extracted and a simple neural network model is developed. In the proposed fuzzy classifier, the energy per frame and change in energy level between the adjacent frames are fuzzified and rules are formulated to segment the voiced portion.

According to cognitive informatics, the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC), which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics, with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics, such as concept algebra, system algebra, realtime process algebra, granular algebra, and visual semantic algebra. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.","","978-1-4244-8042-5","10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599737","Cognitive informatics;abstract intelligence;world-wide wisdom;WWW+;cognitive computing;cognitive computers;computational intelligence;denotational mathematics;next generation internet","Cognitive informatics;Algebra;Computational intelligence;World Wide Web;Computers;Software engineering;Software","Boolean algebra;cognitive systems;computational complexity;inference mechanisms;Internet;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;peer-to-peer computing;search engines","cognitive computing;World Wide Wisdom;next generation Internet;computational intelligent capability;cognitive informatics;natural intelligence;query transfer;information network;network infrastructure;autonomous computer;intelligent computer;machinable thought;computational inference;cognitive learning engine;autonomous learning system;natural language;cognitive search engine;machine learning based search system;cognitive knowledge acquisition;machine supported problem solving;denotational mathematics;concept algebra;system algebra;real time process algebra;granular algebra;visual semantic algebra;Boolean algebra;conventional computing technology;information search based Internet;brain simulation;cyberspace;autonomous super neural cell;information sharing;WWW+ based Internet;computational intelligence;service providing network;distributed agent network;distributed cognitive sensor network;distributed remote control system","","17","","18","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The didactic control benches seek to overcome this limitation, but are expensive and usually do not have great flexibility. The use of simple electrical circuits favors the concepts understanding to engineering students in the electricity area. The buck converter has an RLC circuit in the output, which means the control analysis can be studied from this circuit. The controller design is more complex because it involves the use of actuators. However, even for a lay student in Power Electronics, can be performed an assembly for the buck converter control is provided for the driver to the inverter switches. In this way, the student can browse concepts related to dynamic model, transient response, disturbance rejection and controller design without a field of Power Electronics.

At least 80%-95% of the colorectal cancers are evolved from intestinal polyps. Although colonoscopy is regarded as the most effective method for screening and diagnosis, the success of the procedure is highly dependent on the level of hand-eye coordination and the operator skills. Thus, we are primarily motivated by the need for obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis of polyps in the colonoscopy images. In this paper, we employed the powerful object detection neural network “Mask R-CNN” to identify and segment polyps in the colonoscopy images. Also, we proposed an ensemble method to combine the two Mask R-CNN models with different backbone structures (ResNet50 and ResNet101) to enhance the performance. Mask R-CNNs in our model were first trained on COCO dataset, and then finely tuned using intestinal polyp dataset since a large number of annotated colonoscopy images are not easily accessible. In order to evaluate our proposed model, we used three open intestinal polyp datasets, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS-Larib, and CVC-ColonDB. Our results show that our transfer learning-based ensemble model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900672","National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648333","Polyp segmentation;transfer learning;medical image analysis;deep learning;machine learning;artificial intelligence","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Cancer;Colonoscopy;Task analysis;Biomedical imaging;Deep learning","biological organs;cancer;computerised tomography;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;object detection","transfer learning-based ensemble model;instance segmentation models;polyp segmentation;colorectal cancer;frequently diagnosed cancer;screening diagnosis;hand-eye coordination;powerful object detection neural network;segment polyps;Mask R-CNN models;ResNet50;ResNet101;intestinal polyp dataset;annotated colonoscopy images;open intestinal polyp datasets","","7","","47","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is concluded that the calibration reliability has big differences between UHF signal energy and discharge capacity of different discharge source. The calibration curve of corona discharge and suspended discharge which can representation the severity of equipment insulation defect more accurate, and the calibration curve of internal air gap discharge and dielectric surface discharge is poorer. The distance of UHF signal energy decays to stable period become smaller with increase of frequency, and the decay of UHF signal energy is irrelevant to its frequencies when the measuring angle is changing. The frequency range of measuring UHF signal depends on effective frequency range of measurement sensor, moreover, the gain and standing-wave ratio of sensor and the energy of the received signal manifested same change trend. Therefore, in order to calibration the UHF signal, it is necessary to comprehensive consideration the specific discharge type and measuring condition.

In this work, we evaluated the application of state-of-the-art deep learning and transfer learning models to determine if the author of a copied hand drawing of a template displays signs of cognitive disease. Compared to expert cognitive evaluation, our best performing method yielded a mean accuracy of 67.60% and area under ROC of 0.595 in determining if an undiagnosed subject displays signs of cognitive disease. Our results suggest that state of the art techniques in deep learning have the potential to help alleviate the difficulty of screening for early signs of cognitive disease.

The system is supported by the Texas General Land Office as part of its mission to mitigate the effect of catastrophic oil spills on the Texas Coast. Buoys communicate surface currents and water temperature measured at 2m depth in near real time via cell phone and commercial satellite digital data links. One buoy located at East Flower Garden Banks has a 300 kHz ADCP, a meteorology package with an ultrasonic acoustic wind velocity sensor, and a conductivity sensor. Data are posted regularly to a Web page http://www.gerg.tamu.edu/tglo and are available to the public and governments within a few hours after data collection. On the TABS Web page, a graphical map presentation of TABS current vectors has links to data tables and historical databases. Links are also provided to other data resources for oceanographic data in the Gulf of Mexico. Also on the Web page are links to an automated continental shelf forecast system that predicts currents over the Texas-Louisiana shelf on an operational basis. There are four major components in this system: (1) forecast wind field retrieving and preparation, (2) shelf circulation model module, (3) simulation plotting module and (4) Web display and file transfer module. The wind field used is a 3-hour interval ETA-22 forecast gridded wind from NOAA NCEP based on 00, 06, 12, and 18UTC model runs. The shelf circulation model is a 3-D version of Princeton Ocean Model (POM) on a domain extending from the coast to a curved line extending from 25/spl deg/N on the Mexican coast to 85/spl deg/W at the coastline of Florida. The operational POM model used at this time is a simplified barotropic version that permits us to reduce computational time to allow prediction of surface currents twenty-four hours into the future. The data vs. model comparison from April through December, 1999 of nine nearshore TABS buoys indicates modest skill of the model in predicting the wind driven circulation. A fully baroclinic version of TABS-POM model is undergoing tests and will be implemented on an operational basis when sufficient computational resources become available. We are also developing data-assimilating models of the whole Gulf of Mexico and beyond to couple to our shelf model to supply outer boundary conditions.","","0-933957-28-9","10.1109/OCEANS.2001.968300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968300","","Sea measurements;Wind forecasting;Predictive models;Web pages;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement;Acoustic sensors;Petroleum;Land surface temperature","wind;oceanographic regions;oceanographic equipment;information resources;data acquisition;radiotelemetry;marine telemetry;atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric measuring apparatus;geophysics computing","coastal currents;Texas Automated Buoy System;TABS;Brownsville;Sabine;catastrophic oil spills;surface currents;water temperature;East Flower Garden Banks;Web page;graphical map presentation;Gulf of Mexico;Texas-Louisiana shelf;wind field;forecast;shelf circulation model module;simulation plotting module;Web display and file transfer module;Princeton Ocean Model;POM;barotropic version;TABS-POM model;data-assimilating models","","3","","5","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hu","Defense and Aerospace, Systems Test Group, Teradyne, North Reading, MA","2017 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","26 Oct 2017","2017","","","1","5","In recent years, synthetic test instruments have become increasingly popular in the automatic test equipment (ATE) market. This type of instrument gives users the ability to create custom solutions to better meet their test requirements. FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based solutions are the most common synthetic test instrument on the market today. FPGA based solutions can work well due to their inherent flexibility and programmability. They offer high bandwidth outputs and scalable design components, and the design can be easily maintained or transported. The portability of FPGA based solutions is especially advantageous in cases where designs must be maintained over long periods of time, as they can be transferred between test instruments as those are changed or upgraded. However, FPGA design can be complicated and requires increased initial investment. When compared with traditional general-purpose test instruments, the development period tends to be longer. Additionally, while implementing FPGA designs may seem similar to software programming, it requires a different set of skills. To alleviate some of these technical hurdles and to speed up the initial development process, instrument manufacturers offer various solutions to guide the development and ease the implementation process. Test engineers should be aware of the specific complexities that exist for successfully developing FPGA based solutions, how these are offset by the benefits, and how each can be mitigated using appropriate strategies. As an example, using hardware description language (HDL) requires a learning curve, but results in improved portability. If long term maintenance of the test program is critical, HDL designs can be easily transferred from obsolete instruments to new instruments with next generation FPGAs. Though HDL is one of several development methodologies that can be used, the scope of this paper will be limited to examples using HDL. Aspects of initial setup, interfacing with many peripherals, and simulation can also pose challenges. Real world examples of these challenges will be discussed alongside suggestions on how to address them, including discussion of offerings from instrument vendors that can help with developing a successful test.","1558-4550","978-1-5090-4922-6","10.1109/AUTEST.2017.8080480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8080480","FPGA;Field Programmable Gate Array;Synthetic Instrument;HDL","Field programmable gate arrays;Instruments;Hardware design languages;Tools;Logic gates;Hardware;Software","automatic test equipment;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;logic design","test program;test engineers;instrument manufacturers;general-purpose test instruments;FPGA design;FPGA based solutions;common synthetic test instrument;Field Programmable Gate Array;test requirements;automatic test equipment market;synthetic test instruments;ATE;FPGA development;instrument vendors;obsolete instruments;HDL designs","","","","5","","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a planar force-feedback device, subjects performed exploratory movements within an environment that simulated 1) negative viscosity added to elbow and shoulder joints 2) augmented inertia to the upper and lower arm combined with negative viscosity, or 3) a null force field (control). After training, we evaluated each subject's ability to perform circular movements in the null field. Negative viscosity training resulted in greater within-day reductions in error compared with the combined field training. Negative viscosity promoted greater distributions of accelerations during free exploration, especially in the sagittal axis, while combined field training diminished overall activity. Both force field training groups exhibited next day retention, while this was not observed for the control group. The improvement in performance suggests that greater range of kinematic experiences contribute to learning, even despite novel force field environments. These findings provide support for the use of movement amplifying environments for upper extremity rehabilitation, allowing greater access to training while maintaining user engagement.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-9862-8","10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975514","robotic rehabilitation;upper extremity;skill transfer","Training;Viscosity;Force;Robot kinematics;Acceleration;Performance evaluation","biomechanics;bone;force control;handicapped aids;kinematics;medical disorders;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;prosthetics;viscosity","negative viscosity;upper extremity training;stroke survivors;planar force-feedback device;exploratory movements;elbow joints;shoulder joints;augmented inertia;null force field;force control;circular movements;sagittal axis;kinematics;upper extremity rehabilitation","Biomechanics;Humans;Robotics;Robotics;Stroke;Upper Extremity","9","","31","","11 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods for utilizing unlabeled data can have a huge potential to further accelerate robotic learning. We consider here the problem of performing manipulation tasks from pixels. In such tasks, choosing an appropriate state representation is crucial for planning and control. This is even more relevant with real images where noise, occlusions and resolution affect the accuracy and reliability of state estimation. In this work, we learn a latent state representation implicitly with deep reinforcement learning in simulation, and then adapt it to the real domain using unlabeled real robot data. We propose to do so by optimizing sequence-based self- supervised objectives. These use the temporal nature of robot experience, and can be common in both the simulated and real domains, without assuming any alignment of underlying states in simulated and unlabeled real images. We further propose a novel such objective, the Contrastive Forward Dynamics loss, which combines dynamics model learning with time-contrastive techniques. The learned state representation that results from our methods can be used to robustly solve a manipulation task in simulation and to successfully transfer the learned skill on a real system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches by training a vision-based reinforcement learning agent for cube stacking. Agents trained with our method, using only 5 hours of unlabeled real robot data for adaptation, shows a clear improvement over domain randomization, and standard visual domain adaptation techniques for sim-to-real transfer.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197326","","Robots;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Visualization;Stacking;Data models;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;neural nets;robot vision","visual robotic manipulation;robotic visual data;reinforcement learning algorithms;robotic learning;state estimation;latent state representation;deep reinforcement learning;unlabeled real robot data;robot experience;time-contrastive techniques;learned state representation;vision-based reinforcement learning agent;standard visual domain adaptation techniques;self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation;sequence-based supervised objectives;contrastive forward dynamics loss","","1","","45","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional surgery needs that the surgeon transfers complex anatomic and surgical planning information using spatial sense and experience. The surgical procedure depends entirely on the manual skills of the operator. The development of virtual force feedback haptic devices and image-guided systems offer new revolutionary opportunities to perform such types of critical surgeries. Integrating pre-surgical 3D patient model in haptic environment and surgical robot with navigation system resulted in great improvement and progress in the surgery and patient care. The aim of this project is to design the prototype maxillofacial surgical robot having Master-Slave configuration. Virtual Force feedback and image-guided system are introduced in surgery. As a result, the surgeons are able to simulate the surgery with patient's 3D model by virtual force feedback haptic tool and then using same pattern, perform real surgery via image guided system and prototype maxillofacial surgery robot.

In this context, this paper introduces the promising idea of manipulability transfer, a method that allows robots to learn and reproduce desired manipulability ellipsoids from expert demonstrations. The proposed framework is built on a tensor-based formulation of Gaussian mixture model that takes into account that manipulability ellipsoids lie on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. This geometry-aware method is used to design a manipulability-based redundancy resolution that allows the robot to modify its posture so that its manipulability ellipsoid coincides with the desired one.

With the massive retirement of expert engineers in aging society, an effective training/education scheme for new workers is desired. However, cell production system is widely used lately and each worker is supposed to do every step of the process and thus the worker should learn more and more kinds of manufacturing skills and process. It is also desired that fresh workers can learn the skills by themselves, however, transferring skills is a very difficult issue. Learning by print-based manuals is not effective, because it is not easy to understand how to operate 3D objects and how the process transition goes from 2D documents. Besides, flipping the pages to find the information during the work is troublesome. In this research, a new training system is built with a movable head-up display, which can be adapted to actual workspaces and allows the user to access the digitized guidance contents with semitransparent touch-sensitive screen. The effectiveness is experimentally shown by applying the proposed system for some tasks to make ""origami"", a kind of skillful paper craft works.","","0-7695-3067-2","10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4426773","","Educational products;Displays;Manufacturing processes;Costs;Computer aided manufacturing;Production facilities;Retirement;Aging;Production systems;Design automation","","","","","","9","","7 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, a 6-DOF UR-5 industrial robot arm is equipped with sensors to observe the welding process. Human welder operates a virtualized welding torch, whose motion is tracked/recorded. A correlation between the welding current and welding speed controlled by human welder is proposed for GTAW pipe welding with specified welding conditions. Satisfactory welds with consistent penetration are generated in welding experiments under different welding currents. It is also concluded that for top part of the pipe welding, instead of manipulating a full set of welding parameters, adjusting welding speed is sufficient to generate satisfactory welds.

We first replicated two representative sets of perceptual learning experiments by training a shallow CNN to perform the relevant tasks. These networks qualitatively showed most of the characteristic behavior observed in perceptual learning, including the hallmark phenomena of specificity and its various manifestations in the forms of transfer or partial transfer, and learning enabling. We next analyzed the dynamics of weight modifications in the networks, identifying patterns which appeared to be instrumental for the transfer (or generalization) of learned skills from one task to another in the simulated networks.

However, this amount is spent without any consideration for the skill and luck of the player. For a casino, an unskilled player could fetch ~4× more revenue than a skilled player. This paper describes a video recognition system that is based on an extension of the Mask R-CNN model. Our system digitizes the game of blackjack by detecting cards and player bets in real time and processes decisions they took in order to create accurate player personas. Our proposed supervised learning approach consists of a specialized three-stage pipeline that takes images from two viewpoints of the casino table and does instance segmentation to generate masks on proposed regions of interests. These predicted masks along with derivative features are used to classify image attributes that are passed onto the next stage to assimilate the gameplay understanding. Our end-to-end model yields an accuracy of ∼95% for main bet detection and ∼98% for card detection in a controlled environment trained using transfer learning approach with 900 training examples. Our approach is generalizable and scalable and shows promising results in varied gaming scenarios and test data. Such granular level gathered data, helped in understanding player’s deviation from optimal strategy and thereby separate the skill of the player from the luck of the game. Our system also assesses the likelihood of card counting by correlating player’s betting pattern to the deck’s scaled count. Such a system lets casinos flag fraudulent activity and calculate expected personalized profitability for each player and tailor their marketing reinvestment decisions.","","978-1-7281-8470-8","10.1109/ICMLA51294.2020.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356141","player intelligence;instance segmentation;montecarlo simulation;blackjack;wager detection;strategy evaluation;card counting","Training;Image segmentation;Transfer learning;Supervised learning;Games;Streaming media;Real-time systems","","","","","","28","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A FAST microwave Emissivity Model (FASTEM), which was developed by the Met Office, U.K., has been widely utilized to compute the surface emitted radiation in forward calculations. However, the FASTEM model was developed for frequencies in the range of 20-60 GHz, and it is biased at higher and lower frequencies. Several critical components such as variable sea surface salinity and full Stokes vector have not been generally taken into account. In this paper, the effects of the permittivity models are investigated, and a new permittivity model is generated by using the measurements for fresh and salt water at frequencies between 1.4 and 410 GHz. A modified sea surface roughness model from Durden and Vesecky is applied to the detailed two-scale surface emissivity calculations. This ocean emissivity model at microwave is now being used in the Community Radiative Transfer Model, and it has resulted in some major improvements in microwave radiance simulations.

Accurate dynamic trajectory generation in order to respond to the tennis ball from the opponent and a novel control scheme for robust and high-performance tracking of the ball in such dynamic situations is a prerequisite to winning the game. In this paper, the dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are employed for the stable generation of dynamic trajectories in the presence of environmental uncertainties such as ball position and velocity, opponent position and velocity and so on. In DMP, kernels parameters need to be found from expert demonstrations using a learning technique. To mitigate environmental uncertainties by accurate reconstruction of novel dynamic trajectories by combining multiple DMPs, we propose a piecewise linear canonical system (PLCS)-based modified DMP in contrast to the standard exponential canonical system (ECS)-based DMP. To enhance effectiveness and performance, a novel learning technique based on Lyapunov stability is embedded with the above-developed formulation. We show that the proposed learning technique is faster, has the best steady state error performance, and requires almost half the kernels than the state of the art. Next, to intercept the dynamic moving ball in real-time using the DMP, a novel control scheme is needed and designed using fuzzy fractional order sliding mode control. The control scheme results in chatter free tracking of the desired trajectories because the control law is free from sgn(·) function. The tracking control performance is guaranteed theoretically via the Lyapunov approach and also verified through simulations and experiments. Finally, we have developed a complete system (including a vision system for tracking the ball) using a real 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) Barrett Wam robotic arm and show that the proposed overall framework is able to respond to a hanging ball with high accuracy.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2019.2913129","UK-India Education and Research Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715375","Dynamic trajectory generation;fractional calculus (FC);fuzzy logic;sliding mode control;transfer learning","Trajectory;Manipulators;Task analysis;Games;Sports;Uncertainty","control engineering computing;control system synthesis;fuzzy control;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;manipulators;motion control;position control;robot dynamics;robust control;variable structure systems","hanging ball;tracking control performance;control law;chatter free tracking;control scheme results;dynamic moving ball;steady state error performance;learning technique;standard exponential canonical system-based DMP;piecewise linear canonical system-based;ball position;environmental uncertainties;dynamic trajectories;stable generation;dynamic movement primitives;dynamic situations;high-performance tracking;tennis ball;accurate dynamic trajectory generation;multifaceted challenges;human opponent;table tennis;interactive robot manipulation skills;game setting;robust controller","","","","60","IEEE","15 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use a probabilistic mixture model to describe regions in state space which are common to successful trajectories in different instances. Then, we extract policy fragments from previously-learnt policies that are specialised to these regions. These policy fragments are options, whose initiation and termination sets are automatically extracted from data by the mixture model. In novel task instances, these options are used in an SMDP learning process and option learning repeats over the resulting policy library.

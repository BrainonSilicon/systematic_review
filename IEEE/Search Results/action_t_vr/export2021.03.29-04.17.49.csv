"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for String Stable Mixed Traffic: Benchmark and Human-Centered Design","F. Li; Y. Wang","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","7 Dec 2017","2017","18","12","3473","3485","With the emergence of vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) cars can be expected in the near future. In this paper, novel criteria for string stability are proposed for mixed traffic platoons that consist of both automated and manual driving cars. A mixed traffic string stability definition is proposed to guarantee the boundedness of the motion states fluctuation upstream as well as the safety of the entire platoon. With proper arrangements of the platoon sequence as well as mild restrictions on the leading car's velocity overshoot, the proposed mixed traffic string stability can be realized via some suitable controller design for the automated cars. The benchmark controller with feedback and feedforward path is first used to verify the above results with rigorous proof. Furthermore, a human-centered CACC system is designed to improve both physical and psychological comfort of a driver under the guarantee of mixed traffic string stability. The action-point car-following model is adapted to quantify the driver's psychological comfort in combination with the quantification of physical comfort based on jerk. A model predictive control-like blending ratio controller is developed to obtain the optimal time headway in the feedback controller for tradeoffs among driver comfort, fuel efficiency, and traffic throughput under string stability constraints. Finally, a seven-car CACC mixed traffic platoon scenario is simulated. Compared with the benchmark CACC controller design, the human-centered CACC design is shown to largely improve the driving comfort.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2760805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094925","Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC);mixed traffic;string stability;human-centered controller","Stability criteria;Transfer functions;Psychology;Cruise control;Human factors;Vehicular ad hoc networks","adaptive control;automobiles;control system synthesis;cooperative systems;feedback;feedforward;predictive control;road traffic control;road vehicles;stability;velocity control","mixed traffic string stability definition;platoon sequence;automated cars;benchmark controller;human-centered CACC system;action-point car-following model;feedback controller;string stability constraints;human-centered CACC design;string stable mixed traffic;human-centered design;vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology;adaptive cruise control cars;mixed traffic platoons;automated driving cars;controller design;model predictive control;blending ratio controller;cooperative adaptive cruise control","","8","","36","","3 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Field effects of frequencies up to 1 kHz and above 1 MHz are well known. The intermediate frequency range lacks intensive research. Only little attention has been paid so far. Yet due to recent innovations in medical diagnostics and therapies like Magnetic Particle Imaging or RF-Hyperthermia, the need arises to investigate the frequency range from 1kHz to 1 MHz. This work presents results of numerical field calculations of a human body model placed within simple coil configurations. Induced current densities, generated by alternating coil currents, are simulated. The effect of current densities are demonstrated and evaluated on schematic cell models of excitable tissue. In order to generate an action potential at the cell membrane, a difference in electric potential from intra- to extracellular space must be present. It can be shown that in case of sufficient field strength, stimulation of nerves and muscles is possible up to a frequency of 100 kHz.

In robotics, this ability is referred to as visual servoing: moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual feedback. In this paper, we propose learning viewpoint invariant visual servoing skills in a robot manipulation task. We train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine which actions move the end-effector of a robotic arm to a desired object. This problem is fundamentally ambiguous: under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing approach uses its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to previous visual servoing methods, which assume known dynamics or require a calibration phase. We learn our recurrent controller using simulated data, synthetic demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We then describe how the resulting model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from control and only adapting the visual layers. The adapted model can servo to previously unseen objects from novel viewpoints on a real-world Kuka IIWA robotic arm.

These filters are based on the 2-D spatial wavelet decomposition of the surface EMG recorded with a grid of electrodes and inverse transformation after zeroing a subset of the transformation coefficients. The filter transfer function depends on the selected mother wavelet in the two spatial directions. Wavelet parameterization is proposed with the aim of signal-based optimization of the transfer function of the spatial filter. The optimization criterion was the minimization of the entropy of the time samples of the output signal. The optimized spatial filter is linear and space invariant. In simulated and experimental recordings, the optimized wavelet filter showed increased selectivity with respect to previously proposed filters. For example, in simulation, the ratio between the peak-to-peak amplitude of action potentials generated by motor units 20deg apart in the transversal direction was 8.58% (with monopolar recording), 2.47% (double differential), 2.59% (normal double differential), and 0.47% (optimized wavelet filter). In experimental recordings, the duration of the detected action potentials decreased from (mean plusmn SD) 6.9 plusmn 0.3 ms (monopolar recording), to 4.5 plusmn 0.2 ms (normal double differential), 3.7 plusmn 0.2 ms (double differential), and 3.0 plusmn 0.1 ms (optimized wavelet filter).

The multiple input multiple output (MIMO) control model represents the real system with linear approximation by estimating the transfer functions. A linear controller based on the Integral-Proportional-Derivate (I-PD) scheme is proposed. In this control scheme, proportional and derivative actions are put into the feedback line to reduce the dynamics due to the uncertainties of the load and voltage reference. The nonlinear system dynamics is transformed to d-q axis coordinates making linear controller easy to design. The study focused on the theoretical and simulation analysis aspect by comparing uncompensated and compensated system. The simulation in MATLAB software environment shows that the compensated system has an excellent set-point signal tracking capability and robustly maintains voltage magnitude during the load parameter uncertainties. The power quality of the compensated system also fulfills the required standard according to the IEEE recommendation. Bode diagrams provide more specific control performance characteristics.

The patients are able to control the external devices directly from their neural signals by the decoder. Due to various reasons such as mental fatigue and distraction, the distribution of the neural signals might change, which might lead to poor performance for the decoder. In this case, we need to calibrate the parameters before each session, which needs the professionals to label the data and is not convenient for the patient's usage at home. In this paper, we propose a covariant cluster transfer mechanism for the kernel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to speed up the adaptation across sessions. The parameters of the decoder will adaptively change according to a reward signal, which could be easily set by the patient. More importantly, we cluster the neural patterns in previous sessions. The cluster represents the conditional distribution from neural patterns to actions. When a distinct neural pattern appears in the new session, the nearest cluster will be transferred. In this way, the knowledge from the old session could be utilized to accelerate the learning in the new session.

We show that these two measures produce very similar propagation patterns for simulated microelectrode activity over a relatively smaller number of channels. However as the number of channels increases, partial directed coherence produces better estimates of the actual propagation pattern.

Current techniques rely on long distances of propagation to increase the amount of temporal dispersion in the compound signals and reduce the relative effect of errors in the forward model. The method described in this paper attempts to reduce errors in DCV estimation through transfer function normalization and, thereby, eliminate the need for long segments of nerve. Compound action potential (CAP) signals are recorded from several, equally spaced electrodes in an array spanning only a 10-cm length of nerve. Relative nerve-to-electrode transfer functions (NETFs) between the nerve and each of the array electrodes are estimated by comparing discrete Fourier transforms of the array signals. NETFs are normalized along the array so that waveform differences can be attributed to the effects of temporal dispersion between recordings, and more accurate DCV estimates can be calculated from the short nerve segment. The method is tested using simulated and real CAP data. DCV estimates are improved for simulated signals. The normalization procedure results in DCVs that qualitatively match those from the literature when used on actual CAP recordings.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.784142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=784142","","Bioelectric phenomena;Electrodes;Electric potential;Diseases;Dispersion;Transfer functions;Inverse problems;Shape measurement;Pharmaceutical technology;Pathology","neurophysiology;bioelectric potentials;transfer functions;discrete Fourier transforms;medical signal processing;biomedical electrodes;array signal processing","conduction velocity distribution estimation;short segment of nerve;noninvasive determination;peripheral nerve;temporal dispersion;compound signals;reduced errors;transfer function normalization;action potential signals;equally spaced electrodes;relative nerve-to-electrode transfer functions;discrete Fourier transforms;array signals;waveform differences;normalization procedure;electroneurography;inverse problem;forward problem;10 cm","Action Potentials;Adult;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Humans;Male;Median Nerve;Models, Neurological;Neural Conduction;Peripheral Nerves;Reaction Time;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","13","","25","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a modeling approach to find optimal prosthesis dynamics in gait simulations without constraining the prosthesis to follow kinematics allowed by a specific joint mechanism. To accomplish this, we render a transtibial prosthetic device as the composition of its resultant forces and moments as they act upon the prosthetic foot and socket and allow 3 degree-of-freedom planar motion. The model is implemented into a human musculoskeletal model and used to solve dynamic optimizations of muscle and prosthesis controls to minimize muscle effort and loading on the residual limb during walking. The emphasis on muscle effort vs. limb loading is varied in the minimization objective and the resulting optimal prosthesis dynamics are compared. We found that muscle effort and socket loading measures were reduced for our prosthesis model compared to a revolute joint prosthesis model. We interpret large displacements in the linear axes to transfer energy to the plantarflexion action before toe-off and reduce loading at the socket-limb interface. Our results suggest this approach could assist in the design of non-biomimetic prostheses but requires experimental validation to assess our modeling assumptions, as well as progress toward increased fidelity of predictive simulation approaches more generally.","1945-7901","978-1-7281-2755-2","10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8779532","","Prosthetics;Sockets;Load modeling;Muscles;Loading;Biological system modeling;Legged locomotion","artificial limbs;gait analysis;medical robotics;muscle;physiological models","gait simulations;specific joint mechanism;transtibial prosthetic device;prosthetic foot;degree-of-freedom planar motion;human musculoskeletal model;dynamic optimizations;residual limb;limb loading;revolute joint prosthesis model;socket-limb interface;robotic lower limb prosthesis design;muscle effort;optimal prosthesis dynamics;socket loading measures","Artificial Limbs;Biomechanical Phenomena;Gait;Humans;Joints;Lower Extremity;Prosthesis Design","2","","26","","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"On the sign of the feedback applied by power system damping controllers","L. Rouco; F. L. Pagola","Sch. of Eng., Univ.

No.01EX502)","6 Aug 2002","2001","2","","7 pp. vol.2","","This paper studies the sign of the feedback applied by Power System Damping Controllers (PSDCs). The sign of the feedback to be applied by power system stabilizers (PSSs) is well established from the understanding of the physical mechanisms of their damping action. However, the complexity of the damping action provided by FACTS devices does not allow to determine easily the sign of the feedback to be applied by their damping controllers. This paper discusses the sign of the feedback applied by PSDCs in the context of their design using eigenvalue sensitivities. As the eigenvalue sensitivity approach to design PSDCs focuses only on the poorly damped electromechanical modes, they can be properly damped whereas one or several unstable modes may arise if the sign of the feedback is not proper. This paper suggests a criterion to determine the sign applied by PSDCs. It is based on the analysis of the frequency response of the open loop transfer function combined with conclusions drawn from the numerical pole zero analysis of several open loop transfer functions of a small power system. The application of the criterion is illustrated in a small power system widely used for fundamental studies of power system electromechanical oscillations.","","0-7803-7139-9","10.1109/PTC.2001.964756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964756","","Feedback;Power systems;Damping;Power system analysis computing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Transfer functions;Power system control;Control systems;Frequency response;Poles and zeros","power system stability;power system control;control system synthesis;damping;circuit oscillations;feedback;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;frequency response;control system analysis","power system damping controllers;power system stabilizers;physical mechanisms;damping action;FACTS devices;feedback sign analysis;control simulation;eigenvalue sensitivity approach;control design;poorly damped electromechanical modes;frequency response;open loop transfer function;numerical pole-zero analysis;power system electromechanical oscillations","","","","13","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A preliminary analysis shows that the frequency responses from the actuators to the microphones are characterized by a very large band and exhibit a high modal density with many resonance peaks. Based on these facts, the design of a feedback control law could originate spillover phenomena, which will manifest through the generation of high frequency sounds even more unpleasent than the original noise. Therefore we propose the design of a controller based on an open loop control philosophy; that is the control action is designed in such a way that the spectrum of the control signals is contained into the disturbance band. Since the noise we deal with is not of a classical type (pure sinusoidal or multi-tonal) but is a wide band disturbance, classical open loop control techniques, based on model inversion, cannot be implemented; to this end the concept of Generalized Frequency Response, which allows us to deal with wide band signals, is introduced in the paper.

A generic mathematical model for multi-reservoir networks with well-defined MFDs for each reservoir is presented first. Then, an optimal control methodology is employed for the design of perimeter and boundary flow control strategies that aim at distributing the accumulation in each reservoir as homogeneously as possible, and maintaining the rate of vehicles that are allowed to enter each reservoir around a desired point, while the system's throughput is maximized. Perimeter control occurs at the periphery of the network while boundary control occurs at the inter-transfers between neighborhood reservoirs. Based on this control methodology, control actions may be computed in real-time through a linear multivariable integral feedback regulator (LQI). To this end, the heterogeneous network of Downtown San Francisco is partitioned into three homogeneous reservoirs that exhibit well-defined MFDs. These MFDs are then used to design and compare the proposed LQI regulator with a pre-timed signal control plan and a bang-bang controller.

This paper shows that this technique requires a specific noninterference hypothesis, often implicitly assumed, that may be difficult to meet during actual experimental designs. A mathematical justification of the necessity of the noninterference hypothesis is given. Furthermore, two methods are proposed that do not have the same limitations. The first method is based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs, whereas the second one combines cross-spectral estimators with interpolation in the frequency domain. The two identification methods are validated by offline simulations and contrasted to the classic method. The results reveal that the classic method fails when the noninterference hypothesis is not fulfilled; on the contrary, the two proposed techniques give reliable estimates. Finally, the three identification methods are applied to experimental data from a closed-loop control task with pilots. The two proposed techniques give comparable estimates, different from those obtained by the classic method. The differences match those found with the simulations. Thus, the two identification methods provide a good alternative to the classic method and make it possible to simultaneously estimate human's neuromuscular and visual responses in cases where the classic method fails.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2384525","myCopter Project; European Commission under the Seventh Framework Program; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045541","Haptic feedback;neuromuscular system;pilot identification;tracking task;Haptic feedback;neuromuscular system;pilot identification;tracking task","Visualization;Haptic interfaces;Neuromuscular;Force;Transfer functions;Admittance;Frequency measurement","aerospace control;autoregressive processes;closed loop systems;feedback;frequency-domain analysis;haptic interfaces;interpolation","multiloop identification;visual pilot response estimation;neuromuscular pilot response estimation;multiloop pilot model;neuromuscular system;visual system;cross-spectral density estimate;noninterference hypothesis;autoregressive model;exogenous input;frequency domain interpolation;offline simulation;closed-loop control task;human neuromuscular response;haptic feedback","Aircraft;Computer Simulation;Cybernetics;Feedback, Sensory;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Task Performance and Analysis;Touch","7","","39","","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result of absorption, local temperature will increase depending on the electrical properties of head layers. In this way, many negative biological actions may occur. In this paper, finite element method based specific absorption rate (SAR) simulation has been carried out and evaluated the temperature distribution in the head model. A rectangular patch antenna, which is modelled equally for mobile phone, has been accepted as an electromagnetic radiation source for this scenario. Head model has been mimicked as multi-layer sphere. The model consists of skin, cancellous bone, cortical bone, dura mater, cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter and white matter, respectively. Each layer has consisted of realistic thickness and individual properties. Electrical and thermal properties of each tissues have been selected through the literature survey. Working frequency is selected as 835 MHz. Simulation results indicated that the most induced SAR values were observed in skin and cerebrospinal fluid.

When the subjects try to control the external devices purely using brain signals without actual movements (brain control), they adjust the neural firing patterns to adapt to device control, which expands the state-action space for the RL decoder to explore. The challenge is to quickly explore the new knowledge in the sizeable state-action space and maintain good performance. Recently quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning (QAGKRL) was proposed to quickly explore the global optimum in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). However, its network size will grow large when the new input comes, which makes it computationally inefficient. In addition, the output is generated using the whole input structure without being sensitive to the new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new kernel based reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes the clustering technique in the input domain. The similar neural inputs are grouped, and a new input only activates its nearest cluster, which either utilizes an existing sub-network or forms a new one. In this way, we can build the sub-feature space instead of the global mapping to calculate the output, which transfers the old knowledge effectively and also consequently reduces the computational complexity. To evaluate our algorithm, we test on the synthetic spike data, where the subject's task mode switches between manual control and brain control. Compared with QAGKRL, the simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve a faster learning curve, less computational time, and more accuracy. This indicates our algorithm to be a promising method for the online implementation of BMIs.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513597","","Kernel;Firing;Decoding;Neurons;Task analysis;Human factors","brain;brain-computer interfaces;computational complexity;Hilbert spaces;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;pattern clustering","BMIs;neural adaptation;limb movements;brain signals;brain control;neural firing patterns;device control;RL decoder;sizeable state-action space;QAGKRL;kernel based reinforcement learning algorithm;clustering technique;nearest cluster;computational time;synthetic spike data;computational complexity;reproducing kernel hilbert space;quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning;neural inputs;brain machine interfaces;learning curve","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cluster Analysis;Movement;Reinforcement, Psychology","3","","12","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) operation of a spark ignition (SI) engine is modeled by using such a complex nonlinear discrete-time system. A dual-controller approach is undertaken where primary adaptive critic NN controller is designed for the nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system whereas the secondary one for the affine nonlinear discrete-time system but the controllers together offer the desired performance. The primary adaptive critic NN controller includes an NN observer for estimating the states and output, an NN critic, and two action NNs for generating virtual control and actual control inputs for the nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system, whereas an additional critic NN and an action NN are included for the affine nonlinear discrete-time system by assuming the state availability. All NN weights adapt online towards minimization of a certain performance index, utilizing gradient-descent-based rule. Using Lyapunov theory, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error, weight estimates, and observer estimates are shown. The adaptive critic NN controller performance is evaluated on an SI engine operating with high EGR levels where the controller objective is to reduce cyclic dispersion in heat release while minimizing fuel intake. Simulation and experimental results indicate that engine out emissions drop significantly at 20% EGR due to reduction in dispersion in heat release thus verifying the dual-control approach.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2008.2000452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4560233","Adaptive critic design;near-optimal control;nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system;output feedback control;separation principle","Sparks;Engines;Neural networks;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Neurofeedback;Observers;Temperature control","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;discrete time systems;feedback;internal combustion engines;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems","reinforcement-learning;dual-control methodology;complex nonlinear discrete-time systems;spark engine EGR operation;adaptive neural network controller;complex feedback nonlinear discrete-time systems;exhaust gas recirculation;spark ignition engine;virtual control;nonstrict feedback;state availability;performance index;gradient-descent-based rule;Lyapunov theory;uniformly ultimate boundedness;closed-loop tracking error;cyclic dispersion","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automobiles;Computer Simulation;Energy Transfer;Gases;Hot Temperature;Models, Theoretical;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated","19","","23","","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than presuming that patients could generalize in three conditions, this study tested whether there was any evidence of such generalization ability in healthy individuals. We found that there was some evidence in all conditions except for the ability of healthy subjects to generalize to large movements after practicing small.

Existing tools are based on supercomputers or customized neuromorphic architectures to compute large-scale SNN models. However, many of them are unsuitable to carry out real-time analysis of large scale SNN with minimal cost as large amount of complex data needs to be processed and displayed at the same time. This work intends to provide an efficient cost effective and power efficient emulation tool based on hardware-software hybrid to process, control, and display large-scale SNN network behavior in real time. The solution consists of a customized hardware architecture that computes the neural-synaptic parameters and a software environment that displays the same on the screen of a general purpose computer (Host). The data to be visualized is transferred to the host through high speed Ethernet link. The proposed solution tailors the use of the Ethernet link bandwidth to an optimum such that the customized neuromorphic architecture and the host computer duo can be used to visualize the dynamics of SNN network of any size in real-time. The hardware and software platforms are scalable in terms of number of neurons and synapses.

To do so, we investigate the spatial properties of an extracellular action potential (AP). This properties are described qualitatively and quantitatively using analytical study on an inhomogeneous an anisotropic nerve model. Then, a spectral analysis on this spatial signal discriminates the different frequency components. Low spatial frequencies represent the global shape of the signal, whereas high frequencies are related to the type of fibers.

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads.

This risk is due to deficits in posterior chain and hip recruitment associated with aberrant frontal knee loads. The identification of these risk factors has led to targeted neuromuscular training (NMT) interventions to enhance hip neuromuscular control during such tasks. Despite the successful modification of ACL injury risk factors following NMT, the transfer of these corrected movement patterns to the sport-specific contexts has not been directly evaluated. Sport-specific virtual reality (VR) may provide the best method to measure training transfer to realistic sport performance, while still allowing appropriate experimental control and high-fidelity performance measurements. The current study examined the effect of a biofeedback-driven augmented NMT (aNMT) on skill transfer of ACL-injury resistant movement patterns during performance of sport-specific VR scenarios. Five trained athletes participated, and their performance on an unanticipated cutting task was assessed in VR prior to and after six weeks of aNMT. A significant 87% reduction in internal hip rotation was observed on the plant leg during the loading phase of cutting (p = .05), along with an observed 116% reduction during the push-off phase (p = .02), from pre- to post-training. A non-significant trend of a 19% reduction in knee abduction was also observed (p = .15).

The controller consists of a nonlinear excitation controller and a fast valving controller for each generator. By employing the direct feedback linearization (DFL) technique, a decentralized nonlinear controller is found for multimachine power system excitation control. The excitation controller design problem for an n-machine system is converted to designing n controllers for n linearized and decoupled plants. Then, an optimal fast valving controller is designed to reduce the mechanical power input when a severe fault occurs. In order to reduce the control cost, the fast valving loop is switched on for only a certain period after a fault occurs. By the coordinated action of the two control inputs, transient stability of the system can be greatly enhanced. The proposed scheme is applied to a three-machine system. Simulation results show that power angle oscillations after large disturbance can be damped out rapidly. Simulation results also indicate that the performance of the proposed controller is robust against fault location, network variation and power transfer conditions.","","0-7803-2981-3","10.1109/EMPD.1995.500708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=500708","","Control systems;Power system control;Power system transients;Power system stability;Linear feedback control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Power system faults;Power systems;Optimal control;Costs","power system stability;power system transients;power system control;nonlinear control systems;decentralised control;controllers;control system synthesis;feedback;linearisation techniques;optimal control","nonlinear decentralized coordinated control;multimachine power systems;transient stability enhancement;fast valving controller;nonlinear excitation controller;direct feedback linearization;decoupled plants;linearized plants;optimal fast valving controller;controller design;control cost reduction;power angle oscillations;fault location;network variation;power transfer conditions","","2","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the original model presents a tradeoff between violating the Nyquist criterion on one hand and using a discretization frequency that is unnecessarily high with respect to the bandwidth of the generated AP on the other. Here, we present an improved line source model that, compared to the original, allows a lower discretization frequency while retaining the accuracy by simply introducing a continuous-time anti-aliasing filter. Moreover, a transfer function form of the transmembrane current is presented that promote the use of sophisticated signal processing methods on these type of signals. Both continuous-time and discrete-time models are presented. We also address and analyze the implications of the finite length of the muscle fibers. Including this in the model is straightforward, owing to the convolutional form of the line source model, and is manifested by a simple transformation of the associated weighting function. AP modeling is discussed for the three different electrode models: the concentric needle electrode, the single fiber electrode, and the macro electrode. The presented model is suitable for modeling large motor units, where both accuracy and computational efficiency are important factors. To simplify the selection of the discretization interval, we derive what we call the cumulative cutoff frequency that provides an estimate of the required Nyquist frequency.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.834292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344191","","Muscles;Electrodes;Signal processing;Cutoff frequency;Frequency estimation;Signal analysis;Bandwidth;Filters;Transfer functions;Convolution","electromyography;physiological models;medical signal processing;Nyquist criterion;filtering theory;transfer functions;biomembranes;biomedical electrodes","fast muscle action potential simulations;line source model;signal processing;Nyquist criterion;discretization frequency;continuous-time antialiasing filter;transfer function;transmembrane current;continuous-time model;discrete-time model;weighting function;electrode models;concentric needle electrode;single fiber electrode;macroelectrode;cumulative cutoff frequency;electromyography","Action Potentials;Animals;Computer Simulation;Electromyography;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Neurons;Muscle Fibers;Neural Conduction","6","","31","","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the SISO formulation, the reference yaw rate is first defined according to the vehicle handling requirements and is then corrected based on the actual sideslip angle. The sideslip angle contribution guarantees a prompt corrective action in critical situations such as incipient vehicle oversteer during limit cornering in low tire-road friction conditions. A design methodology in the frequency domain is discussed, including stability analysis based on the theory of switched linear systems. The performance of the control structure is assessed via: 1) phase-plane plots obtained with a nonlinear vehicle model; 2) simulations with an experimentally validated model, including multiple feedback control structures; and 3) experimental tests on an electric vehicle demonstrator along step steer maneuvers with purposely induced and controlled vehicle drift. Results show that the SISO controller allows constraining the sideslip angle within the predetermined thresholds and yields tire-road friction adaptation with all the considered feedback controllers.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2019.2949539","European Union’s FP7 Programme (iCOMPOSE Project); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981891","Controlled drift;electric vehicle;experimental tests;sideslip angle control;tire-road friction coefficient;torque vectoring (TV);yaw rate control","Friction;Stability analysis;TV;Torque;Transfer functions;Mathematical model;Wheels","control system synthesis;electric vehicles;feedback;friction;road safety;road vehicles;single-input single-output systems (control);stability;steering systems;switching systems (control);tyres;vehicle dynamics","single input single output direct yaw moment control;electric vehicles;concurrent control;single-input single-output yaw rate controller;vehicle handling requirements;incipient vehicle oversteer;low tire-road friction conditions;nonlinear vehicle model;multiple feedback control structures;vehicle drift;SISO controller;sideslip angle control;stability analysis;phase-plane plots;switched linear systems","","8","","52","CCBY","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the PR-controller action is analyzed and an enhancement is proposed. It is shown that the classical implementation is particularly sensitive to high frequency noises coming from measurements and relocating the proportional action (RPA) on the feedback path can overcome this issue.

In brief, an amplifier system does a continuous analog computation of the current that would be flowing between the two cells if there had been an intercellular coupling conductance G/sub c/, and then provides current inputs to the cells accordingly. Building on this concept, we developed the computer-controlled ""model clamp"" technique, in which an isolated cardiac cell is dynamically coupled in real time to a comprehensive mathematical cell model (e.g., the phase-2 Luo-Rudy model). With this system we have the ability to vary coupling conductance, effective size of both model cell and real cell, and intrinsic cellular properties of the model cell. In courses on cardiac electrophysiology, the model clamp system provides a useful computer tool to probe action potential transfer between cardiac cells. It can be used to assess alterations in the critical value of coupling conductance required for action potential transfer from a real ventricular cell to the Luo-Rudy model ventricular cell upon exposure of the real cell to, e.g., noradrenaline.","1094-687X","0-7803-7211-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2001.1019732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019732","","Clamps;Probes;Coupling circuits;Rabbits;Physiology;Mathematical model;Heart;Multidimensional systems;Calcium;Cardiology","digital simulation;cellular biophysics;bioelectric potentials;cardiology;physiological models;biology computing","computer tool;action potential transfer probing;cardiac cells;electrically coupled cells;dynamically coupled cells;comprehensive mathematical cell model;Luo-Rudy model ventricular cell;noradrenaline;isolated cardiac cell;coupling conductance;continuous analog computation;intrinsic cellular properties;cardiac electrophysiology","","","","34","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Type 1 oscillation was induced with stochastic resonance (SR) by additive Gaussian noise at lower amplitudes, while Type 2 oscillation was observed at higher amplitudes. However, the mechanism of Type 2 oscillation is not clear. In this article, we test the hypothesis through computer simulations that the period of the Type 2 oscillation can be affected by temperature in a recurrent neural network in which the recurrent model is constructed by four Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron models. Each HH neuron model is driven by Gaussian noise and sub-threshold excitatory synaptic currents with an alpha function from another HH neuron model, and the action potentials (spike firings) of each HH neuron model are transferred to the other HH neuron model via sub-threshold synaptic currents. From spike firing times recorded, the inter spike interval (ISI) histogram was generated, and the periodicity of spike firings was detected from the ISI histogram at each HH neuron model. The results show that the probability of spike firings in the Type1 oscillation is maximized at a specific standard deviation (S.D.) of the Gaussian white noise with SR at 6.3, 15.0 and 25.0degC, while the period of the Type 2 oscillation depends on temperature. It is concluded that the Type1 oscillation can be induced by additive Gaussian white noise on the basis of a synaptic delay in the recurrent HH neuron model, whereas ISIs of the Type 2 oscillation may be determined by refractory periods of HH neuron models.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333069","Sub-threshold Synaptic Transmission;Action Potential;Stochastic Resonance;Hodgkin-Huxley model;InterSpike Intervals;Computer Simulation;Temperature;Q10","Recurrent neural networks;Neurons;White noise;Intersymbol interference;Additive white noise;Strontium;Gaussian noise;Histograms;Stochastic resonance;Additive noise","Gaussian noise;neurophysiology;physiological models;probability;recurrent neural nets","noise induced oscillations;recurrent neural networks;additive Gaussian white noise;recurrent Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model;type 1 oscillation;stochastic resonance;computer simulation;type 2 oscillation;subthreshold excitatory synaptic currents;alpha function;spike firing;interspike interval histogram;probability;refractory periods","Neural Networks (Computer);Noise","1","","10","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is shown how a modified form of controller, a PI-PD controller, which corresponds to PI control of a plant transfer function changed by the PD feedback can produce improved control in several situations. This implementation avoids the derivative kick problem associated with derivative action in the forward path, which still exists when a filter is included. Further, the PD in the inner feedback loop enables placement of the open loop poles in appropriate positions thereby providing good control for open loop system transfer functions having resonances, unstable, or integrating poles. The simulation results show significantly improved performance of the proposed control method particularly for the latter processes.","0743-1619","0-7803-4990-3","10.1109/ACC.1999.786236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=786236","","Three-term control;Open loop systems;Transfer functions;Error correction;Feedback loop;Control systems;Delay effects;Pi control;Filters;Resonance","transfer functions;feedback;three-term control;pole assignment","classical PID controllers;error signal;linear transfer function;PI-PD controller;PI control;plant transfer function;PD feedback;inner feedback loop;open loop poles","","22","","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exact positioning and high precision tracking of the end-effector along a given path are key requirements. Due to flexibility and non minimum phase nature of the system, achieving high level performances is a challenging problem. To this purpose a two degrees of freedom control scheme is proposed: a feedforward action, denoted by r (t), is applied to the stable closed loop system Σf,c, given by the feedback connection of the flexible arm with a stabilizing controller. The recently proposed pseudo inversion approach is adopted to compute r(t) yielding an actual end-effector transient trajectory which is the best approximation of the desired transient one. The optimal r(t) is assumed to be given by a B-spline function, and, to take into account saturating actuators, the actual control input u(t) forcing the flexible arm is optimally approximated by a B-spline u(t), whose control points u(t) are chosen in such a way to satisfy the saturation constraints on u(t). If u(t) is a sufficiently accurate approximation of u(t), the exact fulfillment of saturation constraints by u(t) are transferred to u(t). The main advantage of the approach is its generality: the method can be directly applied to the linear dynamic model of any multilink flexible arm.","2473-3504","978-1-5386-7890-9","10.1109/MED.2018.8443070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443070","","Splines (mathematics);Transient analysis;Steady-state;Trajectory;Manipulators;Feedforward systems","actuators;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;end effectors;feedback;feedforward;flexible manipulators;manipulator dynamics;position control;splines (mathematics);stability;tracking","account saturating actuators;actual control input;linear dynamic model;multilink flexible arm;optimal end-effector positioning;numerical simulation;link flexible manipulator linearized model;potential possibility;B-spline function;actual end-effector transient trajectory;recently proposed pseudoinversion approach;stabilizing controller;loop system;freedom control scheme;high level performances;high precision tracking;exact positioning;control effort;saturation constraints;end-effector positioning task;optimal output transition problem","","","","24","","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the Dimitrov-Dimitrova (D-D) convolutional model, the first temporal derivative of the intracellular action potential (IAP) is used as the source. In this model, the ratio between the amplitudes of the second and first phases of the SFAP (which we call the PPR, after peak-to-peak ratio) increases invariably with radial distance. This is not the case of real recorded fibrillation potentials (FPs). Moreover, FPs show a wider PPR range than that which the D-D model can provide. These discrepancies suggest that the D-D model should be revised. Since the volume conduction parameters seem to have no apparent effects on the PPR, we assume that the origin of this difference lies in the excitation source. This paper presents a new analytical description of the IAP based on that expressed in the D-D model. The new approximation is shown to model FPs with a range of PPRs comparable to that observed in a set of real FPs which we used as our test signals.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.870257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608507","Fibrillation potential;intracellular action potential;peak-to-peak-ratio;SFAP model","Muscles;Bioelectric phenomena;Electric potential;Convolution;Optical fiber testing;Transfer functions;Shape;Electrodes;Pathology","muscle;cellular biophysics;bioelectric potentials;physiological models;convolution","fibrillation potential modeling;muscle intracellular action potential;single-fiber action potential;bioelectrical source;transfer function;convolution;electrical volume conduction;Dimitrov-Dimitrova convolutional model","Action Potentials;Adult;Aged;Computer Simulation;Denervation;Female;Humans;Intracellular Space;Male;Models, Neurological;Muscle Fibers;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle, Skeletal;Neural Conduction","16","","23","","20 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new control scheme is proposed and investigated which aims to maintain speed control of the wind turbine, as well as being able to compensate for torque pulsations as a result of wind speed variations. These torque pulsations are the main cause of shaft overstressing and result in the premature failure of gearboxes, rotors and drive trains. The control strategy implemented makes use of well-known Proportional (P) and Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers, and therefore does not need sophisticated models of the wind turbine system requiring knowledge of parameters specific to the machine. The controller implemented consists of two control loops, the one being a speed control and the other a torque controller. The controller is implemented on a 2kW three-phase permanent magnet wind turbine. System simulations showed that the control strategy was able to operate successfully, however, in practice it was found that the speed control loop operated but the torque control was unsuccessful. This was due to high levels of noise as a result of the differential action on the torque feedback loop.","","978-1-4673-4569-9","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505773","wind turbine;shaft stress;gearbox failure;torque pulse compensation","Wind turbines;Torque;Shafts;Stress;Generators;Rotors;Transfer functions","fatigue;feedback;gears;PD control;shafts;torque control;velocity control;wind turbines","wind turbine control strategy;shaft stress reduction;fatigue loading;wind turbine drive trains;premature gearbox failures;speed control;torque pulsations;proportional derivative controllers;torque control;torque feedback loop","","2","2","14","","22 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the information in the CNS is transmitted through supra-threshold signals and the effect of stochastic resonance in neurons on these signals is unknown. Therefore, we investigate through computer simulations whether information transmission of supra-threshold input signal can be improved by uncorrelated noise in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models by supra-threshold stochastic resonance (SSR). The mutual information was estimated as an index of information transmission via total and noise entropies from the inter-spike interval (ISI) histograms of the spike trains generated by gathering each of spike trains in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models at N = 3D1, 2, 4, 10, 20 and 50. It was shown that the mutual information was maximized at a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, i.e., a typical curve of SR was observed when the number of neurons was greater than 10 with SSR. However, SSR did not affect the information transfer with a small number of neurons. In conclusion, SSR may play an important role in processing information such as memory formation in a population of hippocampal neurons.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333973","Action Potential;supra-threshold stochastic resonance;hodgkin-huxley model;homogeneous poisson process;synaptic noise;information-theoretic analysis;numerical method;monte carlo simulation","Stochastic resonance;Neurons;Strontium;Mutual information;Signal detection;Additive noise;Background noise;Computer simulation;Noise generators;Entropy","brain;neural nets;neurophysiology;stochastic processes","stochastic resonance;supra-threshold neural signals;additive noise;hippocampal CA1 neuron models;array-enhanced stochastic resonance;interspike interval;uncorrelated noise","Animals;Electricity;Hippocampus;Membrane Potentials;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Rats;Signal Transduction;Stochastic Processes","1","","18","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The GA was coupled to NEURON using a model of extracellular stimulation of a mammalian myelinated axon. Stimulation waveforms represented the organisms of a population, and each waveform's shape was encoded into genes. The fitness of each waveform was based on its energy efficiency and ability to elicit an action potential. After each generation of the GA, waveforms mated to produce offspring waveforms, and a new population was formed consisting of the offspring and the fittest waveforms of the previous generation. Over the course of the GA, waveforms became increasingly energy-efficient and converged upon a highly energy-efficient shape. The resulting waveforms resembled truncated normal curves or sinusoids and were 3-74% more energy-efficient than several waveform shapes commonly used in neural stimulation. If implemented in implantable neural stimulators, the GA optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgery.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333722","","Genetic algorithms;Energy efficiency;Shape;Energy consumption;Biological information theory;Evolution (biology);Neurons;Biological system modeling;Extracellular;Nerve fibers","genetic algorithms;neurophysiology;prosthetics;secondary cells","genetic algorithm;energy efficient waveforms;neural stimulation;energy consumption;battery powered implantable stimulators;biological evolution;NEURON;mammalian myelinated axon;energy efficiency","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation;Energy Transfer;Models, Neurological;Nerve Fibers, Myelinated","4","","9","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, the evaluation of a BCI system is approached through the quantification of the classifier performance, which is often measured by means of the information transfer rate (ITR). A shortcoming of this approach is that the control interface design is neglected, and hence a poor description of the overall performance is obtained for real systems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel metric based on the computation of BCI Utility. The new metric can accurately predict the overall performance of a BCI system, as it takes into account both the classifier and the control interface characteristics. It is therefore suitable for design purposes, where we have to select the best options among different components and different parameters setup. In the paper, we compute Utility in two scenarios, a P300 speller and a P300 speller with an error correction system (ECS), for different values of accuracy of the classifier and recall of the ECS.

The statistical peak pressure was -16.9/spl plusmn/2.2 kPa during swing phase and 14.3/spl plusmn/2.5 kPa during stance phase. Finite element models have been established to investigate the load transfer between an above-knee stump and the prosthetic socket.

To investigate their neural implementation, mice were trained to do an auditory virtual navigation task and neuronal activity was recorded in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the posteromedial cortex (PM), with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f after gene transfer by AAV2/1 and 2-photon microscopy. A mouse was head restrained and maneuvered a spherical treadmill. 12 speakers around the treadmill provided an auditory virtual environment. The direction and amplitude of sound pulses emulated the location of the sound source, which was moved according to the mouse's locomotion on the treadmill. When the mouse reached the sound source and licked a spout, it got a water reward. The task consisted of two conditions: continuous condition in which the guiding sound was presented continuously and intermittent condition in which the sound was presented intermittently. In both conditions, mice increased lickings as they approached the sound source, indicating that mice recognized the sound-source position and predicted a reward. In intermittent condition, the anticipatory licking was increased even when the sound was omitted, suggesting that mice maintained the predicted sound-source position based on their own actions. We optically recorded calcium transients of up to 500 neurons simultaneously in each of layers 2, 3 and 5 in 8 mice. A subset of neurons increased the activities as mice approached the goal. This increase of activities was observed both with and without sound inputs in all the layers of PPC, while the increase was observed only during sound inputs in PM. To test how the activities in PPC and PM contributed to the prediction of goal distance, we conducted a decoding analysis. Probabilistic decoder predicted the goal distance from the recorded population activities: the decoder was trained with the data in continuous condition. In PPC, the predicted distance significantly decreased both with and without sound inputs consistently with the actual distance to the goal. These results suggest that PPC realizes action-dependent state prediction in the absence of sensory input.","","978-1-4799-8562-3","10.1109/ICIIBMS.2015.7439529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439529","neuroscience;two-photon microscopy;posterior parietal cortex;decoder","Mice;Decoding;Calcium;Microscopy;Neurons;Bioinformatics;Biomedical imaging","brain models;decision making;neurophysiology;probability","action-dependent state prediction;mouse posterior parietal cortex;model-based decision making;action-dependent state transition models;neural implementation;auditory virtual navigation task;neuronal activity;posteromedial cortex;genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f;gene transfer;AAV2/1;2-photon microscopy;spherical treadmill;auditory virtual environment;sound pulses;sound source;mouse locomotion;sound-source position;intermittent condition;anticipatory licking;optically recorded calcium transients;decoding analysis;probabilistic decoder;continuous condition","","","","","","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two kinds of errors/noise: geometric errors and measurement errors exist in the ECG inverse problem and make the solution of such problem more difficulty. In particular, geometric errors will directly affect the calculation of transfer matrix A in the linear system equation AX = B. In this paper, we have applied the truncated total least squares (TTLS) method to reconstruct EPs from BSPs. This method accounts for the noise/errors on both sides of the system equation and treats geometric errors in a new fashion. The algorithm is tested using a realistically shaped heart-lung-torso model with inhomogeneous conductivities. The h-adaptive boundary element method [h-BEM, a BEM mesh adaptation scheme which starts from preset meshes and then refines (adds/removes) grid with fixed order of interpolation function and prescribed numerical accuracy] is used for the forward modeling and the TTLS is applied for inverse solutions and its performance is also compared with conventional regularization approaches such as Tikhonov and truncated single value decomposition (TSVD) with zeroth-, first-, and second-order. The simulation results demonstrate that TTLS can obtain similar results in the situation of measurement noise only but performs better than Tikhonov and TSVD methods where geometric errors are involved, and that the zeroth-order regularization is the optimal choice for the ECG inverse problem. This investigation suggests that TTLS is able to robustly reconstruct EPs from BSPs and is a promising alternative method for the solution of ECG inverse problems.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.912404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384223","ECG inverse problem;truncated total least squares (TTLS) method;h-adaptive BEM;Tikhonov;truncated single value decomposition (TSVD);h-adaptive BEM;inverse problem;Tikhonov;TTLS method;TSVD","Least squares methods;Electrocardiography;Inverse problems;Equations;Surface reconstruction;Measurement errors;Linear systems;Noise shaping;Testing;Conductivity","boundary-elements methods;electrical conductivity;electrocardiography;inverse problems;least squares approximations;physiological models","truncated total least squares method;regularization method;ECG inverse problems;epicardial potentials;body surface potentials;geometric errors;measurement errors;transfer matrix;linear system equation;realistically shaped heart-lung-torso model;inhomogeneous conductivity;h-adaptive boundary element method;forward modeling","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Body Surface Potential Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electrocardiography;Heart Conduction System;Humans;Least-Squares Analysis;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical","38","","50","","14 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The decisions on the allocation of such resources are derived from the minimization of performance cost functions that measure the lay times of carriers over a forward horizon basing on a model of the container flows. Such a model allows one to take advantage of the information available in real time on the arrival or departure of carriers with the corresponding amounts of containers scheduled for loading or unloading. The resulting strategy of resource allocation can be regarded as a feedback control law and is obtained by solving nonlinear programming problems online. Since the computation may be too expensive, a technique based on the idea of approximating offline such a law is proposed. The approximation is performed by using neural networks, which allow one to construct an approximate feedback controller and generate the corresponding online control actions with a negligible computational burden. The effectiveness of the approach is shown via simulations in a case study.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2012.2200680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226837","Container terminal management;neural networks;nonlinear programming;predictive control;resource allocation","Containers;Loading;Predictive control;Mathematical model;Least squares approximation;Resource management","containers;feedback;freight handling;neurocontrollers;nonlinear programming;predictive control;resource allocation","predictive control;container flows;maritime intermodal terminals;resource allocation handling;transfer containers;performance cost functions;forward horizon;feedback control law;nonlinear programming;neural networks;feedback controller;online control actions","","21","","26","","27 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such research yields important information on individual membrane ionic currents and their relation to the single cell action potential. However, it is often difficult to predict how (changes in) individual currents affect cell-to-cell transfer of the cardiac action potential. Therefore, Joyner and coworkers introduced the ""coupling clamp"" technique in which an isolated cardiac cell can be electrically coupled to either another isolated cardiac cell or to an analog model cell that mimics cardiac cell properties (RC circuit). Building on this concept, we developed the PC-controlled ""model clamp"" technique, in which an isolated cardiac cell is dynamically coupled to a comprehensive model cell that is being computed in real time. With this system we have the ability to vary the intercellular coupling conductance as well as the intrinsic cellular properties of the model cell. For (under)graduate students, the coupling clamp and model clamp systems may prove useful tools to learn understand the electrical interactions between cardiac cells underlying synchronization of pacemaker cells and discontinuous action potential conduction between ventricular cells.","1094-687X","0-7803-7789-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1280908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280908","","Coupling circuits;Clamps;Heart;Biomembranes;Physiology;Voltage;Cardiology;Laboratories;Pacemakers;Computer simulation","bioelectric phenomena;cardiology;cellular biophysics;medical computing;physiological models","electrical interactions;two-cell systems;cardiac cells enzymatical isolation;mammalian hearts;cardiac electrophysiology;cardiac electrical properties;cellular level;individual membrane ionic currents;single cell action potential;cell-to-cell transfer;cardiac action potential;coupling clamp technique;analog model cell;cardiac cell properties;RC circuit;PC-controlled model clamp technique;comprehensive model cell;intercellular coupling conductance;intrinsic cellular properties;graduate students;pacemaker cells synchronization;ventricular cells","","","","33","","5 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this purpose, muscle-actuated walking simulation which can offer insights into the actions of muscles during walking is performed in the open-source software OpenSim. The contributions of major muscles of the lower limb to body propulsion and support during walking are analyzed. The analysis indicates that for normal walking, hip flexor, hip extensor, knee extensor, and ankle plantar flexor are the most important contributors in providing propulsion and support, whereas knee flexor and ankle dorsiflexor play a very small role. On this basis, a new twodimensional musculoskeletal model of the lower limb is proposed by replacing the muscles that contribute little to walking with passive elastic elements. In the model, the hip joint is actuated by a pair of Hill-type muscles, while the knee and ankle joints are antagonistically actuated by muscle and spring. The effectiveness of the proposed model in realizing economical bipedal walking is demonstrated by simulation.","","978-1-5386-9245-5","10.1109/IRC.2019.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675612","bipedal walking;muscle function;musculoskeletal model;passive dynamics;energy economical walking","Legged locomotion;Muscles;Knee;Hip;Acceleration","gait analysis;humanoid robots;medical robotics;muscle;orthopaedics;physiological models","bio-inspired musculoskeletal model;lower limb;energy economical bipedal walking;humanoid robots;muscle-actuated walking simulation;body propulsion;hip flexor;hip extensor;knee extensor;ankle plantar flexor;knee flexor;hip joint;Hill-type muscles;ankle joints;open-source software;ankle dorsiflexor;2D musculoskeletal model;OpenSim","","1","","27","","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SR can also improve the transmission of information within single neurons. Since information processing in the brain is carried out by neural networks and noise is present throughout the brain, the hypothesis that noise and coupling play an important role in the control of information processing within a population of neurons to control was tested. Using computer simulations, we investigate the effect of noise on the transmission of information in an array of neurons, known as array-enhanced SR (AESR) in an interconnected population of hippocampal neurons. A subthreshold synaptic current (signal) modeled by a filtered homogeneous Poisson process was applied to a distal position in each of the apical dendrites, while background synaptic signals (uncorrelated noise) were presented to the midpoint in the basal dendrite. The transmembrane potentials were recorded in each cell of an array of CA1 neuron models, in order to determine spike firing times and to estimate the total and noise entropies from the spike firing times. The results show that the mutual information is maximized for a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, implying the presence of AESR. The results also show that the maximum mutual information increases with increased numbers of neurons and the strength of connections. Moreover, the relative levels of excitation and inhibition modulate the mutual information transfer. It is concluded that uncorrelated noise can enhance information transmission of subthreshold synaptic input currents in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models. Therefore, endogenous neural noise could play an important role in neural tissue by modulating the transfer of information across the network.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2126571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738322","Action potential;Hodgkin–Huxley model;Monte Carlo simulation;numerical method;Poisson shot noise;stochastic resonance (SR);synaptic noise","Neurons;Noise;Mutual information;Couplings;Strontium;Entropy;Binary sequences","bioelectric potentials;biological tissues;biomembrane transport;brain;entropy;filtering theory;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;shot noise;stochastic processes","stochastic resonance;information transmission;neural networks;noise-induced phenomenon;signal detection;background noise;brain;array-enhanced SR;hippocampal neurons;subthreshold synaptic current;filtered homogeneous Poisson process;apical dendrites;background synaptic signals;basal dendrite;transmembrane potentials;biological cells;CA1 neuron models;spike firing times;noise entropy;mutual information;endogenous neural noise;neural tissue","Action Potentials;Animals;CA1 Region, Hippocampal;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Monte Carlo Method;Nerve Net;Poisson Distribution;Rats;Stochastic Processes;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles","29","","46","","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use 4-segments rigid body biomechanical model with 3 degrees-of-freedom built on average anatomical proportions. In this controlling scheme, we adopt the output feedback computing through physiologically relevant optimization based upon center of mass (COM) and ground reaction forces (GRF). Furthermore, the output feedback provides passive control action commands including a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based function augmented with nonlinear function computed with feedback linearization. The reference trajectories generate active feed forward torques, in addition with passive torques to settle the motion profiles within human anatomical constraints.

As a result of stimulation to selected shoulder and elbow muscles, individuals are able to increase their range of motion, their reaching ability, and improve their overall shoulder stability. An approach that provides a natural way of controlling arm stimulation is proposed. The controller extracts information from recorded EMG activity of muscles under retained voluntary control and processes these signals to generate the appropriate stimulation levels for the stimulated paralyzed muscles. One subject with complete C5 paralysis has been implemented with this advanced neuroprosthesis which includes four implanted EMG electrodes and 24 channels of stimulation. Eight of these channels were used for hand grasp and six were used for trunk stimulation to provide posture control, trunk stability and weight relief. The shoulder and elbow implanted stimulation channels include the suprascapular, thoracodorsal and radial nerves (via nerve-cuff electrodes) and the pectoralis major, rhomboids and pronator quadratus muscles (via muscle-based electrodes). The thoracic portion of the pectoralis major was transferred to the scapula to restore the actions of the denervated serratus anterior muscle, essential for reaching tasks and shoulder stability.

The proposed technique does not make use of any grid detecting and synchronising infrastructure. In this scheme, the angular deviation of the synchronously rotating working frame of the converter with respect to the grid frame is estimated at the instant of transfer. This error is added as a feedback term to the phase locked loop (PLL) to the dynamics of the PLL and enhance the speed of alignment to the grid frame. A hysteresis control scheme based on the d and q axes components of the line currents, initiates the enhancement action. Further, this idea is extended to develop a new scheme for self synchronization of parallel converters without any dedicated infrastructure. The proposed scheme aligns the working frames of the parallel converters to a common working frame which makes the synchronisation possible. A power reference reset control along with the proposed algorithm also ensures the load sharing feature of the parallel converters. The proposed technique is validated by adequate simulation and experimental test results.","","978-1-5386-1379-5","10.1109/APPEEC.2017.8308925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8308925","","Phase locked loops;Hysteresis;Synchronization;Pulse width modulation;Inverters;Microgrids;Bandwidth","feedback;hysteresis;phase locked loops;power convertors;power grids;power system control","novel PLL based algorithm;parallel converters;hysteresis control scheme;phase locked loop;grid frame;grid connected mode;autonomous mode;phase utility interactive converter;seamless transfer;utility interactive converters;grid mode","","1","","14","","8 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A subject sitting in the virtual environment controls the main character of a virtual reality game: a penguin that slides down a snowy mountain slope. While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2242072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418003","Brain–computer interfaces (BCI);brain switch;game;hybrid BCI;multimodal;multitasking;virtual reality (VR)","Games;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Training;Brain computer interfaces;Educational institutions;Feature extraction","brain-computer interfaces;computer games;virtual reality","thinking penguin game;multimodal brain computer interface control;VR game;highly immersive CAVE;virtual environment;virtual reality game;jump action;game controller;BCI performance;discrete asynchronous action;visual complexity;task demand;joystick control;hybrid BCI implementation","","49","","51","","23 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The “signal” is normally periodic or deterministic whereas the “noise” is normally stochastic. However, in neural systems, signals are often stochastic. Moreover, periodic signals are applied near neurons to control neural excitability (i.e. deep brain stimulation). We therefore tested the hypothesis that a quasi-periodic signal applied to a neural network could enhance the detection of a stochastic neural signal (reverse stochastic resonance). Using computational methods, a CA1 hippocampal neuron was simulated and a Poisson distributed subthreshold synaptic input (“signal”) was applied to the synaptic terminals. A periodic or quasi periodic pulse train at various frequencies (“noise”) was applied to an extracellular electrode located near the neuron. The mutual information and information transfer rate between the output and input of the neuron were calculated. The results display the signature of stochastic resonance with information transfer reaching a maximum value for increasing power (or frequency) of the “noise”. This result shows that periodic signals applied extracellularly can improve the detection of subthreshold stochastic neural signals. The optimum frequency (110Hz) is similar to that used in patients with Parkinson's suggesting that this phenomenon could play a role in the therapeutic effect of high frequency stimulation.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610731","Action potential;Stochastic resonance;Synaptic noise;Numerical method;Monte Carlo simulation","Stochastic resonance;Resonant frequency;Noise;Extracellular;Neurons;Stochastic processes;Information rates","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;brain;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;nonlinear systems;physiological models;Poisson distribution;signal denoising;stochastic processes;surgery","reverse stochastic resonance;hippocampal CA1 neuron model;counter-intuitive phenomenon;noise addition;deep brain stimulation;quasiperiodic signal;neural network;computational methods;Poisson distributed subthreshold synaptic input;synaptic terminals;quasiperiodic pulse train;extracellular electrode;information transfer rate;stochastic resonance signature;subthreshold stochastic neural signal detection;therapeutic effect;high frequency stimulation;ubiquitous phenomenon;nonlinear system;frequency 110 Hz","Computer Simulation;Deep Brain Stimulation;Hippocampus;Humans;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Neurons;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Stochastic Processes","2","","15","","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At any instant, the shape of the muscle signal, motor unit action potential (MUAP), is constant unless there is movement of the position of the electrode or biochemical changes in the muscle due to changes in contraction level. The rate of neuron pulses, whose exact times of occurrence are random in nature, is related to the time duration and force of a muscle contraction. The EMG signal can be modeled as the output signal of a filtered impulse process where the neuron firing pulses are assumed to be the input of a system whose transfer function is the motor unit action potential. Representing the neuron pulses as a point process with random times of occurrence, the higher order statistics based system reconstruction algorithm can be applied to the EMG signal to characterize the motor unit action potential. In this paper, we report results from applying a cepstrum of bispectrum based system reconstruction algorithm to real wired-EMG (wEMG) and surface-EMG (sEMG) signals to estimate the appearance of MUAPs in the Rectus Femoris and Vastus Lateralis muscles while the muscles are at rest and in six other contraction positions. It is observed that the appearance of MUAPs estimated from any EMG (wEMG or sEMG) signal clearly shows evidence of motor unit recruitment and crosstalk, if any, due to activity in neighboring muscles. It is also found that the shape of MUAPs remains the same on loading.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.847525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440598","Electromyographic signals;higher order statistics theory;HOS-based blind deconvolution;motor unit action potential","Higher order statistics;Electromyography;Muscles;Neurons;Signal processing;Shape;Reconstruction algorithms;Electrodes;Transfer functions;Cepstrum","electromyography;statistical analysis;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal reconstruction","higher order statistics;EMG signals;motor unit action potential;nerves;electrode;biochemical changes;muscle contraction;neuron firing pulses;transfer function;system reconstruction algorithm;cepstrum;wired-EMG signals;surface-EMG signals;rectus femoris muscles;vastus lateralis muscles","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electromyography;Humans;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","47","","34","","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lines of action of 43 musculotendon actuators were defined based on their anatomical relationships to three-dimensional bone surface representations. A model for each actuator was formulated to compute its isometric force-length relation. The kinematics of the lower extremity were defined by modeling the hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Thus, the force and joint moment that each musculotendon actuator develops can be computed for any body position. The joint moments calculated with the model compare well with experimentally measured isometric joint moments. A graphical interface to the model has also been developed. It allows the user to visualize the musculoskeletal geometry and to manipulate the model parameters to study the biomechanical consequences of orthopaedic surgical procedures. For example, tendon transfer and lengthening procedures can be simulated by adjusting the model parameters according to various surgical techniques. Results of the simulated surgeries can be analyzed quickly in terms of postsurgery muscle forces and other biomechanical variables.<>","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.102791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=102791","","Orthopedic surgery;Extremities;Joints;Actuators;Solid modeling;Musculoskeletal system;Geometry;Muscles;Humans;Bones","biomechanics;computer graphics;interactive systems;medical computing;physiological models;surgery","subtalar joints;interactive graphics-based model;lower extremity;orthopaedic surgical procedures;musculoskeletal geometry;musculotendon parameters;muscle force;moment;lines of action;anatomical relationships;three-dimensional bone surface representations;model;actuator;isometric force-length relation;kinematics;hip;knee;ankle;metatarsophalangeal joints;graphical interface;postsurgery muscle forces;biomechanical variables","Biomechanics;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Joints;Joints;Leg;Leg;Models, Anatomic;Movement;Musculoskeletal Physiology;Musculoskeletal System;Musculoskeletal System;Orthopedics;User-Computer Interface","1200","46","46","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

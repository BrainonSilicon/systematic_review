Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the optimal AR model order for EEG, but the criteria used in these studies does not necessarily equate to the optimal AR model order for sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based BCI control applications. The present study confirms this by evaluating the EEG spectra of data obtained during control of SMR-BCI using different AR model orders and model evaluation criteria.

Contemporary research answers this question by focusing on the notions of sense of agency and/or sense of ownership. Recently, however, it has been proposed that the bodily self might also be rooted in bodily motor experience, that is, in the experience of oneself as instantiating a bodily structure that enables a specific range of actions. In the current fMRI study, we tested this hypothesis by making participants undergo a hand laterality judgment task, which is known to be solved by simulating a motor rotation of one's own hand. The stimulus to be judged was either the participant's own hand or the hand of a stranger. We used this task to investigate whether mental rotation of pictures depicting one's own hands leads to a different activation of the sensorimotor areas as compared with the mental rotation of pictures depicting another's hand. We revealed a neural network for the general representation of the bodily self encompassing the SMA and pre-SMA, the anterior insula, and the occipital cortex, bilaterally. Crucially, the representation of one's own dominant hand turned out to be primarily confined to the left premotor cortex. Our data seem to support the existence of a sense of bodily self encased within the sensorimotor system. We propose that such a sensorimotor representation of the bodily self might help us to differentiate our own body from that of others.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_00230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6794840","","","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Making systems able to autonomously adapt themselves to changes in their own body or in their environment is still a challenging question for many different scientific communities. Multiple works propose either sophisticated adaptive model-based or learning-based techniques as a solution. Recent contributions have shown that it is possible for an agent to discover the structure of its interaction with the environment or its own body via the so-called sensorimotor flow. The presented work is based on this idea, and a method for building an internal representation of sensorimotor interaction is proposed, which does not require any a priori knowledge or model. A careful mathematical formalization is outlined, together with simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. Several cases are considered allowing for a general discussion. Moreover, plausibility of the internal sensorimotor representation is highlighted by showing that it is possible to consider motion planning directly from it.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2016.2617922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7592439","Active exploration of environment;applications;robots with development and learning skills;using robots to study development and learning","Robot sensing systems;Manifolds;Kernel;Adaptation models;Buildings","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-robot systems","sensorimotor representation;naive agent tactile space;robotics perception;sensorimotor paradigm;adaptive model-based techniques;learning-based techniques;sensorimotor flow","","4","","26","","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation experiments have been developed on a software environment for the iCub robot. Words that express general actions with a sensorimotor component are first taught to the simulated robot. During the training stage the robot first learns to perform a set of basic action primitives through the mechanism of direct grounding. Subsequently, the grounding of action primitives, acquired via direct sensorimotor experience, is transferred to higher-order words via linguistic descriptions. The idea is that by combining words grounded in sensorimotor experience the simulated robot can acquire more abstract concepts.

Pathologically enhanced beta-band (13-35 Hz) oscillatory activity across the cortico-basal ganglia pathways is a prominent neurophysiological phenomenon associated with PD. We hypothesized that weighing together beta-band frequency peaks from simultaneous microelectrode recordings in “off-state” PD patients could map the individual neuroanatomical variability and serve as a biomarker for the location of the STN sensorimotor neurons. We validated our hypothesis with 9 and 11 patients that, respectively, responded well and poorly to bilateral DBS, after at least two years of follow up. We categorized “good” and “poor” DBS responders based on their clinical assessment alongside a > 40% and <;30% change, respectively, in “off” unified PD rating scale motor scores. Good (poor) DBS responders had, in average, 1 mm (3.5 mm) vertical distance between the maximum beta-peak weighted across the parallel microelectrodes and the center of the stimulation area. The distances were statistically different in the two groups (p = 0.0025).

Although during specific execution tasks this can be a reasonably good model, in general, this is an unrealistic and quite restrictive assumption for most real-life situations where more complex cognitive functions need to be evoked, such as long-term, deliberative planning, prioritization among several possible alternatives, etc. In this paper we model a human driver as a hybrid controller that switches between long-term, discrete planning tasks and short-term, continuous trajectory tracking tasks. The new driver model is based on the well-known two-point visual driver model, and it uses a model predictive control (MPC) module in the anticipatory control channel to better predict deliberative, human driver actions. We evaluate this model's performance, and compare it with other driver models using numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed new driver model reacts to the variation of the direction angle in the same way as most human drivers do, and outperforms previous similar driver models.","","978-1-5090-1897-0","10.1109/SMC.2016.7844510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7844510","","Vehicles;Visualization;Brain modeling;Predictive models;Optimization;Numerical models;Kinematics","large-scale systems;linear systems;planning;predictive control;road traffic control;time-varying systems","hybrid sensorimotor driver model;model predictive control;human driver;linear time-invariant system;complex cognitive functions;deliberative planning;discrete planning tasks;continuous trajectory tracking tasks;MPC module;anticipatory control channel","","3","","20","","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model-based adaptive controller implementation requires a closed form dynamic model, valid for a restricted domain of generalized coordinates. We have used an existing method to define this domain and verify that the domain is widely within the range of admissible tasks required for the considered application (movements-based wrist and forearm rehabilitation). Simulation and experimental results that compare the performance of the adaptive controller to a proportional-derivative controller show that the trajectory tracking performance of the adaptive controller is better compared to the performance of a PD controller using the same values of feed-back gains. Further, comparable absolute error performance is obtained with the adaptive controller for feedback gains nearly one third that required for the PD controller. With the lower gains used in the adaptive controller, good tracking performance is achieved with a more compliant controller that will allow the subject to indicate their ability to independently initiate and maintain movement during a rehabilitation session.","1945-7901","978-1-4673-6024-1","10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650412","","Mathematical model;Equations;Adaptation models;Trajectory;Vectors;Robot kinematics","adaptive control;control system synthesis;feedback;manipulators;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;trajectory control","feedback gain;absolute error performance;trajectory tracking performance;forearm rehabilitation;movement-based wrist;generalized coordinates;closed form dynamic model;model-based adaptive controller implementation;upper extremity robotic rehabilitation;serial-in-parallel robot rehabilitation mechanism;RiceWrist;neurological injuries;sensorimotor training;serial-in-parallel robotic rehabilitation device","Adaptation, Physiological;Rehabilitation;Robotics","6","","22","","31 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our method, which we refer to as GPLAC (Generalized Policy Learning with Attentional Classifier), we use both interaction data and weakly labeled image data to augment the generalization capacity of sensorimotor policies. Our method combines multitask learning on action selection and an auxiliary binary classification objective, together with a convolutional neural network architecture that uses an attentional mechanism to avoid distractors. We show that pairing interaction data from just a single environment with a diverse dataset of weakly labeled data results in greatly improved generalization to unseen environments, and show that this generalization depends on both the auxiliary objective and the attentional architecture that we propose.

Methods: The Geweke's spectral measure is combined with the time-varying autoregressive with exogenous input (TVARX) modeling approach, which uses multiwavelet-based ultra-regularized orthogonal least squares (UROLS) algorithm, aided by adjustable prediction error sum of squares (APRESS), to obtain high-resolution time-varying CGC representations. The UROLS-APRESS algorithm, which adopts both the regularization technique and the ultra-least squares criterion to measure not only the signal themselves, but also the weak derivatives of them, is a novel powerful method in constructing time-varying models with good generalization performance, and can accurately track smooth and fast changing causalities. The generalized measurement based on CGC decomposition is able to eliminate indirect influences in multivariate systems. Results: The proposed method is validated on two simulations, and then applied to source level motor imagery (MI) EEGs, where the predicted distributions are well recovered with high TF precision, and the detected connectivity patterns of MI-EEGs are physiologically interpretable and yield new insights into the dynamical organization of oscillatory cortical networks. Conclusion: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the TF-CGC method in tracking rapidly varying causalities of EEG-based oscillatory networks.

In both cases, a learner has to resolve concurrently multiple types of ambiguities while learning how to act in response to particular contexts through the observation of a teacher's demonstrations. We argue that computational models of language acquisition and models of motor skill learning by demonstration have so far only considered distinct subsets of these types of ambiguities, leading to the use of distinct families of techniques across two loosely connected research domains. We present a computational model, mixing concepts and techniques from these two domains, involving a simulated robot learner interacting with a human teacher. Proof-of-concept experiments show that: 1) it is possible to consider simultaneously a larger set of ambiguities than considered so far in either domain; and 2) this allows us to model important aspects of language acquisition and motor learning within a single process that does not initially separate what is “linguistic” from what is “nonlinguistic.” Rather, the model shows that a general form of imitation learning can allow a learner to discover channels of communication used by an ambiguous teacher, thus addressing a form of abstract Gavagai problem (ambiguity about which observed behavior is “linguistic”, and in that case which modality is communicative).","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2013.2279277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588874","Discovering linguistic channels;imitation learning;language acquisition;motor Gavagai problem;robot learning by demonstration;sensorimotor learning","Context;Pragmatics;Acoustic waves;Computational modeling;Speech;Robot sensing systems","human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;robot programming","motor learning by demonstration;ambiguous teacher;simulated robot learner;proof-of-concept experiments;motor skill learning;teacher demonstrations;human teachers;multiple context-dependent sensorimotor skills;language acquisition;Gavagai problem;nonlinguistic sensorimotor skills;multiple linguistic skills;unified imitation learning","","2","","69","","4 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The restoration of upper limb function is an important determinant of quality of life after stroke. Wearable technologies that can measure hand function at home are needed to assess the impact of new interventions. Egocentric cameras combined with computer vision algorithms have been proposed as a means to capture hand use in unconstrained environments, and have shown promising results in this application for individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI). The objective of this study was to examine the generalizability of this approach to individuals who have experienced a stroke. An egocentric camera was used to capture the hand use (hand-object interactions) of 6 stroke survivors performing daily tasks in a home simulation laboratory. The interaction detection classifier previously trained on 9 individuals with cSCI was applied to detect hand use in the stroke survivors.

However, there is a much larger population of patients with some residual motor function as well as the general population of able-bodied individuals, both of whom could benefit significantly from BCIs. An important question that has yet to be systematically studied is: can subjects use BCIs simultaneously with overt motor activity? We present results from a preliminary study aimed at exploring this question. Three subjects used hand motor imagery in an electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI while simultaneously using a joystick to control a cursor. Particular attention was paid to preventing potential muscle artifacts from influencing imagery-based control. All three subjects were able to use the hybrid “imagery+joystick” mode of control over two days, demonstrating the ability to learn and significantly improve performance. These results suggest that subjects can potentially augment their normal human sensorimotor capability by exercising direct brain control over devices concurrently with overt motor control.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347535","","Electroencephalography;Human factors;Brain computer interfaces;Electromyography;Muscles;Electrodes;Training","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;handicapped aids;muscle","brain-computer interfacing;motor control;noninvasive BCI;paralyzed individuals;locked-in individuals;residual motor function;electroencephalographic BCI;EEG BCI;joystick;muscle artifact","Adult;Brain;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Humans;Imagery (Psychotherapy);Learning;Male;Motor Skills;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors;Young Adult","1","","9","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Differential dynamic programming is employed, which allows taking the full, nonlinear human dynamics into consideration. The biomechanical dynamics of the human is modeled by a six link rigid body including leg, trunk and arm segments. Accuracy of the proposed modelling approach is evaluated for different human healthy subjects by comparing simulations and experimentally collected data. Acceptable model accuracy is achieved with a generic set of constant weights that prioritize the different criteria.

This model was studied via extensive simulations that incorporate both a sensorimotor delay and a compensatory feedforward controller, allowing examination of the effects of various sensorimotor delays over a range of target velocity to pursuer velocity ratios. It was found that, with appropriate tuning, both the pursuit and constant bearing strategies operate effectively over a wide range of sensorimotor delays. Additionally, for each strategy, the use of a generalised mean value for this gain provides near-optimal performance, compared to separately optimising the gain for each combination of velocity ratio and delay.

In this article, we study the relationship of the nature of the tuning curves, the distribution of PAs, and computational properties of linear neuronal populations. We show that noise-resistant distributed linear algebraic processing and learning can be implemented by a population of cosine tuned neurons assuming a nonuniform but regular distribution of PAs. We extend these results analytically to the noncosine tuning and uniform distribution case and show with a numerical simulation that the results remain valid for a nonuniform regular distribution of PAs for broad noncosine tuning curves.

Current methods to evaluate the effects of environmental perturbations involve costly systems that physically perturb patients to elicit a compensatory response. Studies have shown that visual feedback alone can elicit dramatic changes in gait; however, the impact of fully immersive visual feedback is not well studied. Here we examined whether a low cost immersive virtual reality (VR) system can elicit perturbation responses similar to a physical disruption. We examined the responses of 11 subjects as they walked through a VR environment consisting of a bridge spanning a lake. While subjects walked on a treadmill mounted to a 6 degree-of-freedom motion base, pseudorandom roll perturbations (3, 6, 11 deg.) were applied visually to the bridge with (VP trials) and without (V trials) the corresponding physical displacement of the motion base. Significant differences were found between normal (unperturbed) walking and normal walking in the VR environment (p<;.05) for average step length, width, and Margin of Stability (MoS). Significant differences were also observed between unperturbed and perturbed walking in the VR environment (p<;0.05 for VP and V trials). While the subjects' responses to visual perturbations were generally lower than to combined visual and physical perturbations, the differences were not statistically significant (p>.05). The results demonstrate that visual perturbations provided in an immersive virtual environment can induce compensatory changes in gait during treadmill walking that are consistent with a physical perturbation. The application of environmental perturbations in VR systems could provide a cost-effective approach for gait rehabilitation in patient populations.","","978-1-5386-3365-6","10.1109/VR.2018.8446432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8446432","Virtual Reality;Head Mounted Display;Visualization.: H.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems]: Artificial;augmented;and virtual realities","Perturbation methods;Visualization;Legged locomotion;Virtual environments;Bridges;Sociology;Statistics","biomechanics;gait analysis;helmet mounted displays;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;virtual reality","external perturbations;immersive head mounted display;sensorimotor control mechanisms;mediate gait compensation;environmental perturbation;patient populations;perturbation responses;physical disruption;VR environment;pseudorandom roll perturbations;unperturbed walking;physical perturbations;immersive virtual environment;treadmill walking;physical perturbation;VR systems;gait rehabilitation;immersive virtual reality system;physical displacement;visual perturbations;gait compensatory changes;immersive visual feedback;6 degree-of-freedom motion base perturbations;VP trials","","1","","30","","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The time-varying parametric modeling approach employs a nonlinear autoregressive with external input model, whose parameters are approximated by a set of multi-wavelet basis functions. A regularized orthogonal least squares (ROLS) algorithm is then used to produce a parsimonious or sparse regression model and estimate the associated model parameters. The time-varying Granger causality between nonstationary signals can be detected accurately by making use of both the good approximation properties of multi-wavelets and the good generalization performance of the ROLS in the presence of high-level noise. Two simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear causal detection respectively. The proposed method is then applied to real EEG signals of MI tasks. It follows that transient causal information flow over the time course between various sensorimotor related channels can be successfully revealed during the whole reaction processes.

We previously proposed a new modular architecture, the modular selection and identification for control (MOSAIC) model, for motor learning and control based on multiple pairs of forward (predictor) and inverse (controller) models. The architecture simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the set of inverse models appropriate for a given environment. It combines both feedforward and feedback sensorimotor information so that the controllers can be selected both prior to movement and subsequently during movement. This article extends and evaluates the MOSAIC architecture in the following respects. The learning in the architecture was implemented by both the original gradient-descent method and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike gradient descent, the newly derived EM algorithm is robust to the initial starting conditions and learning parameters. Second, simulations of an object manipulation task prove that the architecture can learn to manipulate multiple objects and switch between them appropriately. Moreover, after learning, the model shows generalization to novel objects whose dynamics lie within the polyhedra of already learned dynamics. Finally, when each of the dynamics is associated with a particular object shape, the model is able to select the appropriate controller before movement execution. When presented with a novel shape-dynamic pairing, inappropriate activation of modules is observed followed by on-line correction.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976601750541778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790084","","","","","","78","1","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

It is closely linked to automated aspects of sensorimotor control and understood to depend on one's ability to monitor the details of one's movements. As such SoA has been argued to be a critical component of self-awareness in general and contribute to presence in virtual reality environments in particular. A common approach to investigating SoA is to ask participants to perform goal-directed movements and introducing spatial or temporal visuomotor mismatches in the feedback. Feedback movements are traditionally either switched with someone else's movements using a 2D video-feed or modified by providing abstracted feedback about one's actions on a computer screen. The aim of the current study was to quantify conscious monitoring and the SoA for ecologically valid, three dimensional feedback of the participants' actual limb and movements. This was achieved by displaying an Infra-Red (IR) feed of the participants' upper limbs in an augmented virtuality environment (AVE) using a head-mounted display (HMD). Movements could be fed back in real-time (46ms system delay) or with an experimental delay of up to 570ms. As hypothesized, participant's SoA decreased with increasing temporal visuomotor mismatches (p<;.001), replicating previous findings and extending them to AVEs. In-line with this literature, we report temporal limits of 222±60ms (50% psychometric threshold) in N=28 participants. Our results demonstrate the validity of the experimental platform by replicating studies in SoA both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Here, we address the problem of selecting only the clusters that represent genuine responses to the experimental stimulus by modeling the correlation structure of the clustered data using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model is empirically justified by demonstrating the hierarchical organization of the voxel correlations after cluster analysis. BOLD signal discrimination is demonstrated using: 1) simulations that contain multiple pathological BOLD response signals; and 2) fMRI data acquired during an event-related motor task. These demonstrations are compared with results from a model-driven method based on the general linear model. Our simulations show that the data-driven method can discriminate between the BOLD response signals, while the model-driven method only finds one signal. For fMRI, the data-driven method distinguishes between the BOLD signals appearing in the sensorimotor cortex and those in basal ganglia and putamen, while the model-driven method combines these signals into one activation map. We conclude that the proposed data-driven method provides an objective framework to identify and discriminate between distinct BOLD response signals.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2108296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5704191","Bayesian hierarchical model;cerebrovascular disease (CVD);cluster analysis;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);stroke","Correlation;Data models;Bayesian methods;Joints;Analytical models;Brain modeling;Computational modeling","Bayes methods;biochemistry;bioelectric potentials;biomedical MRI;blood;blood vessels;brain;data acquisition;diseases;medical image processing;medical signal detection;neurophysiology;oxygen","Bayesian hierarchical correlation model;fMRI cluster analysis;blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging;BOLD fMRI signal discrimination;cerebrovascular disease;data-driven method;clustering voxel correlations;data acquisition;event-related motor task;general linear mode;sensorimotor cortex;basal ganglia;putamen","Adult;Bayes Theorem;Brain;Brain;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cluster Analysis;Female;Hemodynamics;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Theoretical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","3","","49","","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous comparisons between models have looked at biological realism or mathematical tractability rather than expressive power. This paper, however, investigates whether more sophisticated models are better suited to a complex sensorimotor control task than simpler ones, or whether the more general nature of groups of the simpler neurons allows them to collectively solve complex tasks better despite their individual simplicity. Many models have been proposed or used for sensorimotor control tasks such as the control of locomotion. Four such neural models with varying levels of complexity were chosen. Controllers made of networks of each neural type were evolved to generate locomotion in a simulated dynamically stable four-legged robot using a genetic algorithm. The problem domain was chosen as one for which no simple solution could be hand crafted and which, with its tight sensorimotor coupling, had strongly time-dependent properties as is common in many biological control tasks. Analysis of the results shows that the most complex and biologically based model is significantly better at walking control, even producing recognizable gaits.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2005.844901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1427775","Genetic algorithms;legged locomotion;neural model comparison;walking control","Legged locomotion;Biological system modeling;Biological control systems;Biology computing;Neurons;Shape control;Robot control;Mathematical model;Sliding mode control;Robot sensing systems","neurocontrollers;legged locomotion;motion control;genetic algorithms","neural model;walking control;biological realism;mathematical tractibility;complex sensorimotor control;four legged robot;genetic algorithm","Algorithms;Animals;Biomimetics;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Humans;Locomotion;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Robotics","18","","27","","9 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main objective is to study the influence of social interactions during artificial early prelinguistic development. We argue that this architecture contributes to explain development from voiceless to sequence of vowels vocalizations. A cognitive developmental perspective is considered emphasizing embodied cognition and sensorimotor exploratory behaviors. For a new-born agent, motor constraints are unknown. However, the agent is endowed with a somatosensory system that indicates if a motor configuration was reached or not. This information is used to model and predict constraint violations. Furthermore, the architecture considers imitative behaviors that constrain the search space during exploration. Interaction occurs when the learner sensory production is similar to a sensory unit relevant to communication. In that case, the instructor perceives this similitude and reformulates with the relevant sensory unit. When the learner perceives an utterance by the instructor, it attempts to imitate it. Two systems are considered for experimentation: 1) a toy example and 2) a simulated vocal tract. In general, our results suggest that constraint awareness and social reinforcement contribute to achieve less redundant exploration, lower exploration and evaluation errors, and a clearer picture of developmental transitions.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2018.2883249","CONACYT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8543854","Intrinsic motivations;prelinguistic social development;sensorimotor exploration;somesthetic senses;vocal development","Robot sensing systems;Haptic interfaces;Natural languages;Biological system modeling;Computer architecture;Space exploration","cognition;natural language processing;speech processing","motor configuration;constraint violations;social reinforcement;artificial prelinguistic development;intrinsically motivated exploration architectures;intrinsically motivated sensorimotor exploration architecture;motor constraint awareness;social interactions;artificial early prelinguistic development;vowels vocalizations;cognitive developmental perspective;embodied cognition;sensorimotor exploratory behaviors;new-born agent;sensory unit;somatosensory system","","","","38","IEEE","25 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach identifies, through autonomous exploration, the size and shape of object parts that consistently predict the applicability of a grasp across multiple objects. The robot can then use these parts to plan grasps onto novel objects. By contrast to most recent methods, we aim to solve the part-learning problem without the help of a human teacher. The robot collects training data autonomously by exploring different grasps on its own. The core principle of our approach is an intensive encoding of low-level sensorimotor uncertainty with probabilistic models, which allows the robot to generalize the noisy autonomously-generated grasps. Object shape, which is our main cue for predicting grasps, is encoded with surface densities, that model the spatial distribution of points that belong to an object's surface. Grasp parameters are modeled with grasp densities, that correspond to the spatial distribution of object-relative gripper poses that lead to a grasp. The size and shape of grasp-predicting parts are identified by sampling the cross-object correlation of local shape and grasp parameters. We approximate sampling and integrals via Monte Carlo methods to make our computer implementation tractable. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in simulation. A proof of concept on a real robot is also provided.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-6358-7","10.1109/IROS.2013.6696581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6696581","","Shape;Computational modeling;Grasping;Training;Robot sensing systems;Visualization","control engineering computing;grippers;Monte Carlo methods;robot vision;shape recognition;unsupervised learning","unsupervised learning;predictive parts;cross-object grasp transfer;autonomous exploration;part-learning problem;human teacher;robot;training data;low-level sensorimotor uncertainty;probabilistic models;noisy autonomously-generated grasps;object shape;surface densities;spatial points distribution;grasp parameters;grasp densities;object-relative gripper;grasp-predicting parts;cross-object correlation;local shape parameters;grasp parameters;Monte Carlo methods;computer implementation","","8","","37","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first stage is based on the generalization of previously trained movements associated with a specific task, which results in a first approximation of a suitable control policy in a new situation. The second stage applies learning on the manifold defined by the previously acquired training data, which results in a learning problem of reduced dimensionality. The final tuning of the desired control policy is accomplished by learning in the full state space, where the dimensionality of the problem is much higher. The assumption is that the first two steps already provide a good initial estimate for the optimal control policy so that this final step only locally refines the parameters learned in the first two steps. This significantly reduces the number of test trials needed by standard reinforcement learning techniques.

Bilateral hand movements were recorded and used to provide real-time feedback to subjects during scanning to eliminate performance confounds on fMRI results. The kinematic parameters of each movement were also used in the general linear model with the BOLD signal to investigate training-induced changes in neuromotor coupling. Univariate analysis showed an increase in BOLD signal in the ipsilesional hemisphere in two subjects and a decrease in activity in the other two subjects. Seed voxel based functional connectivity analysis revealed an increase in connectivity between ipsilesional motor cortex and bilateral sensorimotor cortex during finger movements in all four subjects. Hemispheric laterality index values showed a tendency to decrease reflecting a reduction in the over-dominance of the contralesional hemisphere. The study is novel in terms of 1) tracking finger movement during a motor task in the scanner, 2) monitoring motor performance during the experiment and 3) giving online visual feedback of subjects' movement.

To examine the feasibility of this hypothesis and to establish some of its detailed implications, we studied a multilayered, closed-loop computational model of primary sensorimotor cortex. A simulated arm moving in three dimensions formed the external environment for the model cortical regions. Coexisting proprioceptive and motor maps formed and generally aligned in a fashion consistent with the temporal correlation hypothesis. For example, in simulated proprioceptive sensory cortex the map of elements responding strongly to stretch of a particular muscle matched the map of tension sensitivity in antagonist muscles. In simulated primary motor cortex the map of elements responding strongly to increased tension in specific muscles matched the map of output elements for the same muscles. These computational results suggest specific experimental measurements that can support or refute the temporal correlation hypothesis for map alignments.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.1996.8.4.731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6795776","","","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

To improve the limited classification performance of the real SVM, we propose to use an SVM ensemble with bagging (bootstrap aggregating) or boosting. In bagging, each individual SVM is trained independently, using randomly chosen training samples via a bootstrap technique. In boosting, each individual SVM is trained using training samples chosen according to the sample's probability distribution, which is updated in proportion to the degree of error of the sample. In both bagging and boosting, the trained individual SVMs are aggregated to make a collective decision in several ways, such as majority voting, least squares estimation based weighting, and double-layer hierarchical combination. Various simulation results for handwritten digit recognition and fraud detection show that the proposed SVM ensemble with bagging or boosting greatly outperforms a single SVM in terms of classification accuracy.","1051-4651","0-7695-1695-X","10.1109/ICPR.2002.1048262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048262","","Pattern classification;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Bagging;Boosting;Least squares approximation;Probability distribution;Error correction;Voting;Handwriting recognition","learning systems;learning automata;pattern classification;handwritten character recognition;least squares approximations;probability","support vector machine;pattern classification;bagging;bootstrap aggregating;boosting;training samples;probability distribution;majority voting;learning;least squares estimation;handwritten digit recognition","","11","","11","","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks. It provides the analysis of the effects of TCP in 5G mmWave networks, the discussion of TCP mechanisms and parameters involved in the performance over 5G networks, and a survey of current challenges, solutions, and proposals.

Our approach is based on approximating the system dynamics with an ensemble of regression trees. As a result of our approximation, we obtain a model that is a piecewise-affine dynamical system defined over a partition of the state space. In general, the stabilization of the resulting piece-wise affine system requires, in the worst case, solving an exponential number of linear matrix inequalities (with respect to the state dimension). To overcome this computational limitation, we propose a stabilization procedure having a complexity that grows linearly with the number of partitions. This stabilization procedure explicitly exploits the fact that our model is described via an ensemble of regression trees. In addition, we derive probabilistic conditions under which the stabilization of the model implies that the original nonlinear system is also stabilized. Finally, we validate our approach by performing numerical simulations over trajectories of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators.","2576-2370","978-1-7281-1398-2","10.1109/CDC40024.2019.9029865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9029865","","Regression tree analysis;Nonlinear systems;Trajectory;System dynamics;Numerical models;Probabilistic logic","learning systems;linear matrix inequalities;nonlinear dynamical systems;stability;trees (mathematics);uncertain systems","data-driven stabilization;tree-based ensemble learning;nonlinear dynamical system;data samples;system dynamics;regression trees;piecewise-affine dynamical system;linear matrix inequalities;state dimension;stabilization procedure;coupled Van der Pol oscillators","","","","32","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This common introductory robotics course generally covers the fundamental theory of robotics including robot kinematics, dynamics, differential movements, trajectory planning and basic computer vision algorithms commonly used in the field of robotics. The nature of this material almost necessitates the use of robotic hardware to allow the students to practice implementing the theory they learn in class. That is, to fully understand the material, it is necessary for the students to implement algorithms and observe the results on hardware. This paper introduces a software based educational tool designed to be used in introductory robotics courses. The software simulates the geometry of motion (kinematics) of a two link robotic arm and is used by students to implement algorithms based on the robot's kinematic equations. This includes the use of inverse kinematic equations used to determine the joint inputs based on the desired location of the end-effector, as well as trajectory planning and the study of differential movements. It also include a robotic image processing tool that helps the student design robotic vision algorithms. This tool provides a low cost solution to situations where purchasing expensive robotic arms typically needed for this course is not possible, where the existing equipment does not allow for direct joint programming, or simply for on-line robotics courses.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-3191-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826197","robotics;software tool;computer vision;kinematics","Joints;Robot kinematics;Kinematics;Mathematical model;Equations;Image processing","computer aided instruction;control engineering education;digital simulation;educational courses;end effectors;manipulator dynamics;manipulator kinematics;path planning;robot programming;robot vision","robotic arm simulator software tool;introductory robotics courses;robot kinematics;robot dynamics;differential movements;trajectory planning;basic computer vision algorithms;software based educational tool;motion geometry;two link robotic arm;end-effector;robotic image processing tool;engineering programs","","3","","10","","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first learn dynamics for a system without traps from a randomly collected training set (since we do not know what traps will be encountered online). These “nominal” dynamics allow us to perform tasks in scenarios where the dynamics matches the training data, but when unexpected traps arise in execution, we must find a way to adapt our dynamics and control strategy and continue attempting the task. Our approach, Trap-Aware Model Predictive Control (TAMPC), is a two-level hierarchical control algorithm that reasons about traps and non-nominal dynamics to decide between goal-seeking and recovery policies. An important requirement of our method is the ability to recognize nominal dynamics even when we encounter data that is out-of-distribution w.r.t the training data. We achieve this by learning a representation for dynamics that exploits invariance in the nominal environment, thus allowing better generalization. We evaluate our method on simulated planar pushing and peg-in-hole as well as real robot peg-in-hole problems against adaptive control, reinforcement learning, trap-handling baselines, where traps arise due to unexpected obstacles that we only observe through contact. Our results show that our method outperforms the baselines on difficult tasks, and is comparable to prior trap-handling methods on easier tasks.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2021.3057789","NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350150","Machine learning for robot control;reactive and sensor-based control","Task analysis;Robots;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Training data;Robot sensing systems","adaptive control;hierarchical systems;learning (artificial intelligence);predictive control;robots","TAMPC;hybrid dynamics;discontinuous dynamics;trap states;training data;two-level hierarchical control;nonnominal dynamics;adaptive control;trap-aware model predictive control;robot peg-in-hole problem;reinforcement learning","","","","27","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transient improvement is achieved through the introduction of a supplementary discrete-type parametric adaptation law along the iteration-axis, which is obtained in a straightforward manner from the continuous-time parametric adaptation law used in the MRAC scheme. This approach is referred to as the iterative model reference adaptive control (IMRAC). Initially, a standard MRAC scheme is applied to the system under consideration. Thereafter, the parameters are updated iteratively in order to enhance the tracking performance from iteration to iteration. In the case of systems with relative degree one, we obtain a point wise convergence of the tracking error to zero, over the whole finite time-interval, when the number of iterations tends to infinity. In the general case, i.e. systems with arbitrary relative degree, we show that the tracking error converges to a prescribed small domain around zero, over the whole finite time interval, when the number of iterations tends to infinity.

Since neither the dynamic model nor the full state of the beam is required, and the method applies to the tracking of a fixed, finite time output trajectory, the scheme is considered as a learning control strategy. Due to the assumed linearity, this problem is transformed into a standard least square problem. Controller saturation can be incorporated, resulting in a constrained-least-squares problem.

In practice, this may not be true. How to accommodate the iteration-dependent disturbances, uncertainties and the desired trajectories is practically important for any successful application of ILC. In practice, it is observed that the baseline performance of ILC is limited mainly by the nonrepetitiveness factors. In this paper, by the proposed two methods, it is shown that one can harness or make use of the nonrepetitiveness in ILC to reduce the baseline errors. When the pattern of the nonrepetitiveness is known, an internal model principle (IMP) in the iteration domain can be applied. When the pattern of the nonrepetitiveness is unknown in advance, a disturbance observer in the iteration domain is proposed. It is noted that to harness the nonrepetitiveness in ILC, usually, the ILC updating law has to be high-order in the iteration direction. To facilitate our discussion, a supervector notion is adopted in a fairly general setting. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the fact that nonrepetitiveness in ILC, if properly handled, can be harnessed to achieve a better performance previously not achievable.","0191-2216","0-7803-7516-5","10.1109/CDC.2002.1184392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184392","","Convergence;Control systems;Intelligent systems;Educational institutions;Uncertainty;Adaptive control;Error correction;Uniform resource locators;Feedback control;Sampling methods","learning systems;tracking;observers;feedback","tracking control;iterative learning control;nonrepetitiveness;feedback;disturbance observer;internal model principle;iteration domain","","46","","32","","10 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work proposes joint learning of natural language grounding and instructable behavioural policies reinforced by perceptual detectors of natural language expressions, grounded to the sensory inputs of the robotic agent. Our supervision is narrated visual demonstrations (NVD), which are visual demonstrations paired with verbal narration (as opposed to being silent). We introduce a dataset of NVD where teachers perform activities while describing them in detail. We map the teachers' descriptions to perceptual reward detectors, and use them to train corresponding behavioural policies in simulation. We empirically show that our instructable agents (i) learn visual reward detectors using a small number of examples by exploiting hard negative mined configurations from demonstration dynamics, (ii) develop pick-and-place policies using learned visual reward detectors, (iii) benefit from object-factorized state representations that mimic the syntactic structure of natural language goal expressions, and (iv) can execute behaviours that involve novel objects in novel locations at test time, instructed by natural language.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578830","","Visualization;Natural languages;Detectors;Grounding;Task analysis;Speech recognition;Microphones","data mining;feature extraction;human computer interaction;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;object detection;software agents","narrated visual demonstrations;pick-and-place policies;RGB images;narrated demonstrations;reward learning;hard negative mined configurations;instructable agents;perceptual reward detectors;verbal narration;robotic agent;natural language expressions;instructable behavioural policies;natural language grounding","","1","","54","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One way of reasoning about safety of robots is by building safe sets through Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability. However, safe sets are often computed offline, assuming perfect knowledge of the dynamics, due to high compute time. In the presence of uncertainty, the safe set computed offline becomes inaccurate online, potentially leading to dangerous situations on the robot. We propose a novel framework to learn a safe control policy in simulation, and use it to generate online safe sets under uncertain dynamics. We start with a conservative safe set and update it online as we gather more information about the robot dynamics.

Our framework enables robots to simultaneously learn about their dynamics, accomplish tasks, and update their safe sets. It also generalizes to complex high-dimensional dynamical systems, like 3-link manipulators and quadrotors, and reliably avoids obstacles, while achieving a task, even in the presence of unmodeled noise.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341606","","Uncertainty;Reinforcement learning;Safety;Reliability;Task analysis;Manipulator dynamics;Intelligent robots","collision avoidance;learning systems;robot dynamics;set theory","high-dimensional dynamical systems;online updates;uncertain dynamics;safe set;safe control policy;robot dynamics;robot safety;model-based RL setup;Hamilton-Jacobi reachability;control policy learning","","","","28","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this paper shows that it is not hard to tune the PID gains if we can find a Jacobian matrix of the system. Because the Jacobian matrix expresses the ratio of output variations according to input variations, it is possible to adjust the input values in order to reduce the output error. If the cost function is composed of error related terms, the gradient approach can tune the PID gains to minimize the function. In simulation, a hydrofoil catamaran with two inputs and two outputs is considered as a multi variable system. We can easily obtain the multi variable PID controller by the proposed tuning method. When it was compared with a LQR controller with a modelling equation, its performance was very good.","","0-7803-7729-X","10.1109/CCA.2003.1223127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223127","","Gain;Jacobian matrices;Three-term control;Control systems;Cost function;Equations;Optimal control;MIMO;Error correction;Learning systems","three-term control;multivariable control systems;control system synthesis;learning systems;boats;linear quadratic control;Jacobian matrices;MIMO systems","tuning method;PID controllers;multivariable system;Jacobian matrix;cost function;error related terms;hydrofoil catamaran;LQR controller","","","","12","","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The induction motor drives schemes have sometimes similar operational and control blocks which can be called general blocks. In this paper the general blocks are developed and tested for generating a full real time system instead of a single induction motor electric drive scheme. These general blocks (GB) are used in both simulation and experimental design stages without substantial changes. Hence, a small number of GB is required in a basic electric drive course for the purpose of designing experimental electric drive knowledge. Not only do general blocks allow understanding the fundamental principles of electric drives, but also they could be applied for designing complex electric drives topologies. This laboratory setup allows evaluating the most important control blocks used in electric drives in a short period of time for understanding and developing complex control schemes as Space Vector Modulation, Direct Torque Control and V/F for electric drives. To implement the real time system a power evaluation board isolated was used as the main interface between the control system and the electric motor. The dsPACE card was the platform for designing and implementing the real time system.

While there are guidelines for identifying the best teaching style for material, new and evolving areas can present unique challenges. The emerging area of mobile software development, which combines aspects of software, hardware, and interpersonal interaction, captures many such challenges; e.g., understanding how to develop for multiple screen sizes, designing for GPS time lag, dealing with unreliable sensor data. Teaching these challenging materials seemed well suited for multiple approaches that leveraged different learning styles. This paper examines three teaching approaches employed in ten teaching modules across two semesters of a mobile software development course. The approaches included lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming. Lectures were used to introduce topics and explore underlying theories of development. The lectures included time for questions from and for the students, but otherwise did not have an active learning component. Two active learning approaches used in the class were interactive tutorials and Pair Programming. Interactive tutorials presented applied development approaches, then explored their use in an individual-based hands-on demos. Pair Programming is an agile software development practice, used in both industry and education, which enforces a role-based approach to learning new programming concepts. Homeworks were used to assess learning, and surveys reflected student satisfaction. Results show areas of promise and of concern with regard to the learning styles. It seems that repetition of topics is important for mastery of the topics. Foundational theories seem well suited for lectures, while programming concepts work better in active learning situations. Additional learning took place through office hours, online question forums, and individual and group online exploration. The findings suggest specific approaches to teaching challenging and unique mobile software development topics as well as a general approach to identifying ways to distribute learning objectives across lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming sessions.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757533","Mobile Application Development;Computer Science Education;Pair Programming","Mobile communication;Programming profession;Tutorials;Software;Springs","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;mobile computing;software engineering;teaching","teaching mobile application development;lectures;interactive tutorials;teaching styles;learning process;hardware;interpersonal interaction;GPS time lag;unreliable sensor data;learning styles;teaching modules;mobile software development course;active learning component;individual-based hands-on demos;agile software development practice;homeworks;student satisfaction;programming concepts;active learning situations;online question forums;group online exploration;mobile software development topics;distribute learning objectives;pair programming sessions","","2","","26","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the challenging tasks for those robots is planning optimal trajectories due to, not only the redundant Degrees of Freedom (DOF) they own but also their compliant behaviour. In this paper, an Imitation-based Pose Planning (IbPP) approach is proposed to teach a two-section continuum robot the motion primitives that will facilitate achieving and generalizing for spatial point-to-point motion which involves both position and orientation goals encoded in a dual quaternion form. Two novel approaches are proposed in this research to intuitively generate the motion demonstrations that will be used in the proposed IbPP. Namely, a flexible input interface, acting as a twin robot, is designed to allow a human to demonstrate different motions for the robot end-effector. Alternatively, as a second approach, the Microsoft Kinect sensor is used to provide motion demonstrations faster via human arm movements. Based on the kinematic model of the two-section continuum robot, a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm is developed to achieve tracking the generated trajectory from the IbPP and to guarantee the robustness against the model uncertainties and external disturbances. Moreover, controller stability analysis is developed based on Lyapunov criteria. Finally, simulations are conducted for the two-section continuum robot to prove the ability of the proposed IbPP with the two proposed inputs to learn and generalize for spatial motions, which in future could be easily accommodated for robots with multiple sections. In addition, the proposed MRAC shows a significant performance towards following the required trajectory and rejecting the external disturbance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997636","Mission Department of the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) of Egypt for granting him scholarship to carry out his graduate studies with the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099824","Continuum robot;kinematic modeling;motion planning;kinect sensor;kinematic control","Planning;Robot sensing systems;Kinematics;Dynamics;Trajectory;Task analysis","adaptive control;control system synthesis;end effectors;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;manipulator dynamics;manipulator kinematics;medical robotics;mobile robots;model reference adaptive control systems;motion control;path planning;position control;robust control","two-section continuum robot;motion primitives;spatial point-to-point motion;motion demonstrations;twin robot;robot end-effector;spatial motions;multisection continuum robot;imitation learning-based pose planning approach;Microsoft Kinect sensor;controller stability analysis;Lyapunov criteria;MRAC;IbPP;dynamic environments;confined static environments;continuum flexible robots","","1","","50","CCBY","26 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we consider the optimal control problem of the general highly dissipative SDPs, and propose an adaptive optimal control approach based on neuro-dynamic programming (NDP). Initially, Karhunen-Loève decomposition is employed to compute empirical eigenfunctions (EEFs) of the SDP based on the method of snapshots. These EEFs together with singular perturbation technique are then used to obtain a finite-dimensional slow subsystem of ordinary differential equations that accurately describes the dominant dynamics of the PDE system. Subsequently, the optimal control problem is reformulated on the basis of the slow subsystem, which is further converted to solve a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. HJB equation is a nonlinear PDE that has proven to be impossible to solve analytically. Thus, an adaptive optimal control method is developed via NDP that solves the HJB equation online using neural network (NN) for approximating the value function; and an online NN weight tuning law is proposed without requiring an initial stabilizing control policy. Moreover, by involving the NN estimation error, we prove that the original closed-loop PDE system with the adaptive optimal control policy is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the developed method is tested on a nonlinear diffusion-convection-reaction process and applied to a temperature cooling fin of high-speed aerospace vehicle, and the achieved results show its effectiveness.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2320744","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); National Natural Science Foundation of China; General Research Fund through the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818406","Adaptive optimal control;empirical eigenfunction (EEF);highly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs);neuro-dynamic programming (NDP);spatially distributed processes (SDPs).;Adaptive optimal control;empirical eigenfunction (EEF);highly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs);neuro-dynamic programming (NDP);spatially distributed processes (SDPs)","Optimal control;Artificial neural networks;Equations;Adaptive systems;Mathematical model;Vectors;Approximation methods","adaptive control;closed loop systems;dynamic programming;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;partial differential equations;singularly perturbed systems","adaptive optimal control;nonlinear spatially distributed process;SDP;neurodynamic programming;NDP;nonlinear partial differential equation;closed-loop PDE system;Karhunen-Loève decomposition;empirical eigenfunction;EEF;singular perturbation technique;Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation;HJB equation;neural network;NN;nonlinear diffusion-convection-reaction process;temperature cooling fin","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Temperature","101","","68","","19 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To accommodate such complex systems we introduce the concept of a trim network which is seamlessly integrated into our NDP control structure and is trained using our NDP control structure. Second, we introduce a new class of design methodologies to the helicopter control system design community. This approach is expected to be effective in dealing with real-time learning applications such as reconfigurable control. The paper consists of a comprehensive treatise of NDP and extensive simulation studies of NDP designs for controlling an Apache helicopter.

A distributed neural adaptive control scheme for containment is developed, which, different from the current state of the art, is able to achieve dynamic containment in finite time with sufficient accuracy despite unknown nonaffine dynamics and mismatched uncertainties. Such a finite-time feature, highly desirable in practice, is made possible by the fraction dynamic surface control design technique based on the concept of virtual fraction filter. In the proposed containment protocol, only the local information from the neighbor followers and the local position information from the neighbor leaders are required. Furthermore, since the available information utilized is local and is embedded into the control scheme through fraction power feedback, rather than direct linear or regular nonlinear feedback, the resultant control scheme is truly distributed. In addition, although mismatched uncertainties and external disturbances are involved, only one single generalized neural parameter needs to be updated in the control scheme, making its design and implementation straightforward and inexpensive.

However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2560882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463035","Complexity;fidelity;level of detail artificial intelligence (LOD AI);multiagent systems;multiobjective optimization","Complexity theory;Multi-agent systems;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Learning systems;Games","computational complexity;computer animation;computer games;evolutionary computation;multi-agent systems;Pareto optimisation;statistical analysis;virtual reality","multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary computing techniques;multiobjective evolutionary framework;simulation model complexity;behavioral fidelity;virtual worlds;objective function;multiagent systems;video games;nonplayer characters;NPC animation;realistic graphics;human aesthetic judgment bootstrapping;Pareto-optimal frontiers","","1","","36","Traditional","29 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The convective weather, a dominant factor of traffic congestion, is very uncertain and significantly complicates the decision-making process. Other uncertainties such as traffic demands further expand the uncertainty space and complicate the design of optimal control solutions that are robust to uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate the strategic ATFM as a stochastic optimal control problem, and use scalable sampling based dynamic programming and Q-learning approaches to address high-dimensional uncertainties. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches.

In this paper, game-based learning using LEGO block building is applied to improve the descriptively verbal skill. The special model, such as a half bird-half dinosaur creature or something that is not a general object, is used as the prototype model. All members of each team cannot see this model except the team leader which will describe the model information to two sub-leaders one by one. The model information will be divided into two parts for each sub-leader which will carry this information to the members of each subgroup. Finally, the finished 3D figure from all teams will be compared with the prototype model. Results show that most of them quite similar to the prototype.

In order to improve the ability of disturbance rejection and ensure a desired control performance, this paper proposes an Adaptive PID (APID) controller with the self-learning ability based on the Disturbance Observer (DOB). First, the full state-feedback and state observer are utilized to achieve active damping and eliminate the effect of computational delay. Then, aiming to estimate and compensate the lumped disturbance, a DOB is designed. Beneficial from DOB, the steady-state performance is almost not affected by model uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics, however, the transient performance is still deteriorated inevitably due to the limitation of DOB. Thus, an online adaptive method using APID is finally proposed to further improve grid-injected current dynamics. The control parameters can be automatically adjusted in real time by adaptive learning rule, which significantly improves the system robustness and the control performance.

Most of the existing works concentrate on applying U-RA in the oversimplified independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channels. In this paper, we consider a fairly general joint-correlated MIMO channel model with line-of-sight components for the realistic outdoor wireless propagation environments. We conduct the activity detection for the emitted codewords by performing an improved coordinate descent approach with Bayesian learning automaton to solve a covariance-based maximum likelihood estimation problem. The proposed algorithm exhibits a faster convergence rate than traditional descent approaches. We further employ a coupled coding scheme to resolve the issue that the dimensions of the common codebook expand exponentially with user payload size in the practical massive machine-type communications scenario. Our simulations reveal that to achieve an error probability of 0.05 for reliable communications in correlated channels, one must pay a 0.9 to 1.3 dB penalty comparing to the minimum signal to noise ratio needed in i.i.d. channels on condition that a sufficient number of receiving antennas is equipped at the BS.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9347959","National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation (NSFC); Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmission; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Transmission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9347959","activity detection;correlated channel;internet of things;massive MIMO;unsourced random access","Error probability;Receiving antennas;Massive MIMO;Encoding;Channel models;Signal to noise ratio;Convergence","antenna arrays;correlation methods;error statistics;learning (artificial intelligence);learning automata;maximum likelihood estimation;MIMO communication;radiowave propagation;receiving antennas;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","massive unsourced random access;massive MIMO correlated channels;massive random access;base station;grant-free unsourced random access;transmitted codewords;line-of-sight components;realistic outdoor wireless propagation environments;activity detection;emitted codewords;improved coordinate descent approach;Bayesian learning automaton;covariance-based maximum likelihood estimation problem;coupled coding scheme;common codebook;user payload size;massive machine-type communications;descent approach;fairly general joint-correlated MIMO channel;massive antenna number;independent identically distributed channels;error probability;correlated channels;receiving antennas","","","","21","","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To facilitate the control design, the gain functions are designed to be continuous and positive with the bounds being unknown functions. Furthermore, for handling with the difficulty caused by these unknown bounds, several appropriate compact sets are defined to obtain the bounds of gain functions. By utilizing Lyapunov analysis, all the variables of the resulting closed-loop system are proven to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error can converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around zero by choosing design parameters appropriately.

An artificial neural network control scheme which uses continual on-line random training (with no off-line training) to simultaneously identify and adaptively control the speed of the stepper motor is proposed. The control scheme utilizes two three-layer feed-forward artificial neural networks: (1) a tracker identification neural network which captures the nonlinear dynamics of the motor over any arbitrary time interval in its range of operation and (2) a controller neural network to provide the necessary control actions to achieve trajectory tracking of the motor speed. The inputs to the controller neural network are not constructed from the actual motor/load dynamics, but as a feedback signal, from the estimated state variables of the motor supplied by the neural identifier and the reference trajectory to be tracked by the actual speed. This paper also makes use of a very realistic and practical scheme to estimate and adaptively learn the noise content in the speed-load torque characteristic of the motor. Simulations reveal that the neuro-controller adapts and generalizes its learning rate to a wide variety of loads, in addition to providing the necessary abstraction when measurements are contaminated with noise.","0197-2618","0-7803-5589-X","10.1109/IAS.1999.799176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=799176","","Artificial neural networks;Neural networks;Permanent magnet motors;Feedforward neural networks;Trajectory;Feedforward systems;Neurofeedback;State feedback;Signal processing;State estimation","permanent magnet motors;stepping motors;machine control;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;feedforward neural nets;feedback","adaptation learning control scheme;high performance permanent magnet stepper motor;online random training;neural networks;speed control;high-performance drives environment;artificial neural network control;continual on-line random training;off-line training;three-layer feed-forward artificial neural networks;tracker identification neural network;nonlinear dynamics;controller neural network;motor speed trajectory tracking;load dynamics;feedback signal;estimated state variables;neural identifier;noise content;speed-load torque characteristic;neuro-controller","","","2","17","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, the controller parameters of the quadrotor are adjusted for constant load and external disturbance factors. However, whether in military fields or civilian fields, the quadrotor will encounter variable load situations, such as throwing weapons or delivering express. Variable load as a large internal disturbance factor results in control instability. Toward this end, a novel robust sliding mode controller SMC) is designed to track the desired trajectory promptly under variable load condition while restraining the chattering problem. This novel controller consists of learning rate-based sliding mode surface and inverse hyperbolic function-based adaptive sliding mode reaching law. It is worth mentioning that a mass estimation algorithm is added to the proposed novel SMC to estimate the real-time mass of the quadrotor in the air, which improves the quadrotor's performance in restraining the large variable load disturbance impact. In addition, the altitude control law is derived on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are carried out to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller in terms of altitude tracking, mass estimation, and disturbance resistance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890450","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program; Aeronautical Science Fund; NWPU Basic Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598841","Altitude control;variable load;quadrotor UAV;sliding mode control","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Sliding mode control;Estimation;Real-time systems;Convergence;Rotors;Lyapunov methods","adaptive control;attitude control;autonomous aerial vehicles;control system synthesis;helicopters;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;robust control;variable structure systems","variable load condition;chattering problem;inverse hyperbolic function-based adaptive sliding mode reaching law;mass estimation algorithm;altitude control law;altitude tracking;disturbance resistance;variable load quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle;external disturbance factors;military fields;civilian fields;SMC;learning rate based robust sliding mode controller;internal disturbance factor;Lyapunov stability theory","","7","","30","","1 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It aims at improving the generalization ability of NNs by controlling the connectivity of neurons adaptively depending on the input information. To realize such architecture, we use a branch control system having low calculation costs. In the branch control system, the distance between the input values of the network and parameters of the branch control system is calculated. After normalization within 0 to 1, the outputs of the branch control system are multiplied to the branches of the NN. The parameters of the branch control system are trained by a random searching method, RasID, to realize an adaptive optimization with very small number of training steps. Through some simulations, the usefulness of the three-layered NN-bg is shown compared with conventional layered neural networks.","1098-7576","0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1380990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380990","","Neural networks;Control systems;Biological neural networks;Neurons;Costs;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Control system synthesis;Proposals","neural net architecture;learning (artificial intelligence);generalisation (artificial intelligence);adaptive control;optimal control;optimisation;function approximation","three layered neural networks;neural network architecture;branch gates;generalization;branch control system;random searching method;adaptive optimization;neural network training;function approximation;optimal control;adaptive control","","","","13","","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The benefits of adaptive gains in back-propagation networks are explored. It is shown that gradient descent with respect to gain greatly increases learning speed by amplifying those directions in weight space that are successfully chosen by gradient descent on weights. Adaptive gains also allow normalization of weight vectors without loss of computational capacity, and the authors suggest a simple modification of the learning rule that automatically achieves weight normalization. A method for creating small hidden layers by making hidden node gains compete according to similarities between nodes in an effect to improve generalization performance is described. Simulations show that this competition method is more effective than the special case of gain decay.<>","2168-2909","","10.1109/21.101159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=101159","","Intelligent networks;Psychology;Helium;Performance gain;Computational modeling;Nonhomogeneous media;Feedforward systems","learning systems;neural nets","neural nets;speeded learning;minimal hidden layers;back-propagation networks;connectionist network;adaptive gains;gradient descent","","90","3","45","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since 1965 it has come a long way and is being used to do x, y, z (ie. dangerous situations)

Psychologists have been overjoyed at getting to study 'natural' behaviours (ie. do results gained in a lab actual reflect real world processes)

Two questions are outstanding
- Does it transfer
    - Without indication that tasks transfer, VR may not be an appropriate medium for training. This is of particular concern when we're using VR as a subtitute training environment for highly dangerous situations.

2 Research Themes that the studies proposed herein seek to address
- Can one transfer skills learnt in VR to Natural
- Remote research

> possibly state the specific aims here: These Research Themes beget specific questions


## Skill Learning Background
>  literature review for ToL

It has been assumed that ar and vr simulations foster motor learning (Sigrist et al., 2013b).

To support ToL: (Boussad et al., 2008)
(1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classified according to what is learned;
(2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning;
(3) specific features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning;
(4) transfer can be used to assess a VE’s effectiveness; and
(5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning.


Some work has indicated that there is an equivalence in terms of complex skill learning between the real and simulated environments (Alicea, 2020), however Previous reviews have struggled to produce conclusive results due to the variation in sims and their components (Molier et al., 2010).



Transfer of learning from VR to natural has been assessed in knowledge transfer, conflict resolution, mathematics training
- dominated by skill training

Baseball (Gray, 2017), crane operation, car assembly.

Vast literature as simulators are widespread in their use
- the effectiveness of a sim is defined by its ability to teach skills that transfer to the real world (Gopher, 2012).


#### What is learning
Learning is typically defined as a relatively permanent change in a person’s capability to perform a skill (Schmidt & Lee, 2005).  

#### What is a skill?
I am defining skill by 1) something not known prior/something new, 2) able to be measured, 3) able to be improved through training (Adams, 1987)

A 2010 study looked at the effect of VR with haptic feedback from movement on gait and balance, in stroke participants (Mirelman, et. al. 2010). The trainings for both groups consisted on 3 weekly, 1 hour sessions, for 4 weeks. Both groups received identical movement trainings based around dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, eversion, and combination movements; the non-VR group completed these movements at the instruction of a trainer whereas the VR group manipulated a virtually presented boat or plane towards a target. Results post analysis showed the VR group reporting greater improvement, and at faster rates, across multiple different measures. In all measures, the VR group showed significantly superior improvement, which was consistent with previous literature (Reid et. al., 2002; 2005; 2007).
follow up study using motion capture and a screen presentation
Mirelmen conducted a further study using a CAVE to investigate the efficacy of VR on gait training and motor learning in a Parkinson’s presenting population (Mirelman et. al., 2011). The study found a 31% improvement in all motor and gait tasks, and a significant improvement at specific tasks that were reported four times larger than the threshold for significance.
These results were persistent as found in a 1 month follow up.
VR was used by Bryanton and colleagues (2006) to assess the efficacy of using VR in motor rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. The use of the VE was to provide an engaging task, “gamifying” the rehabilitation to aid with rehabilitation protocol adherence, while also investigating the efficacy of VR to ensure exercise “correctness” which would allow for children to complete their rehabilitation at home, thus lower costs and barriers to accessing therapists.
Same rehab exercises
VRE reported more fun and higher interest/engagement
completion of the exercises with greater correctness (as determined by the length of time held in dorsiflexion)
VR participants reached a greater range of motion on average than the non-VR groups


**richest area of research has been the training of surgeons**
#### Surgical Training
Extensive systematic reviews have been conducted

#### Sensorimotor/Visuomotor
(Anglin et al., 2017) Focused their investigation of sensorimotor learning by looking at visuomotor adaptation wherein a participant learns or “adapts” to a perturbation introduced by the experimenters in order to correctly perform a movement (Krakauer, 2009). Similar to how a sharp shooter will have to learn the rigged weighting of a carnival target practice game in order to win the prize.
The study had participants sitting at a desk viewing a computer screen in Virtual Reality and in Natural.
The study’s aims were to investigate a visuomotor adaptation and compare the strategies and adaptation acquired in VR compared with the same task in Natural.  
Implicit and explicit strategy and VR and Natural
Participants in both VR and Natural required the same time to adapt to the perturbation and reduce their errors for the task indicating that
Training block, baseline, rotation, block where participants did not receive visual feedback, then washout
n=24 (12 per group), participants were not requested to report on their previous VR experience
Hmd group felt difference with the quality of the interface statistically significant difference (p=0.064)
This will be discussed later

No significant difference in reaction time
No significant different in early or late adaption, or aftereffect (also called washout) which is the effect that having learnt the adaption has on a non-perturbed movement (similar to the colloquial experience of “sea-legs” after sailors return to land).

Anglin and colleagues found no significant difference in the pure performance of the task in that
The aiming angle was larger in the VR group compared to the natural group
The same target error

HMD-VR participants utilized a greater cognitive strategy than CT participants, and CT participants engaged in greater implicit learning than HMD-VR participants
Participants were able to adapt to perturbations in regardless of the medium
Suggested that the implicit adaptation acquired in VR may not generalize

Criticism of the  Anglin and Liew task
Habituation to VR
Mentioned this and how this may have contributed to the use of a cognitive or “explicit” strategy
Comfort may impact task performance
Visual acuity
IPD and contrast
Ocular dominance
Also just a computer screen task

### Outline the problem
> to provide evidence of project originality.


Despite the wealth of sim literature, research on modern virtual reality technologies is sparse

There is a wealth of historic and contemporary literature on non-HMD-VR that assess transfer of learning.
And yet HMDs are ubiquitous with vr training in industry  
- A Systematic Review was conducted (Analysis ongoing)
    - WIP: give numbers

The HMD literature is largely focused on rehabilitation applications
*Majority of literature in HMD-VR is focused on rehabilitation and has been conducted on impaired or non-normative populations.*
- stroke rehab
- DMD
- CP

And all of this literature is largely conflicting
- Assumed that VR is good enough
- But the literature is torn

A possible explanation for this is the
- differing technologies, differing tasks
- (Smith, 2019)

#### FIFA
A near parabolic or 'uncanny valley' due to simulator fidelity may explain some of the conflict (4x uncanny valley citations)
- other support for FIFA
  - [Ilgen, Sherbino, & Cook., 2013](https://scite.ai/reports/technology-enhanced-simulation-in-emergency-medicine-Vz69PE)

A framework (based on McMahan et al. 2016) and will be included in the PhD project once analysis is complete.

> #### Transition
> to summarize that there are gaps in the literature and that the proposed work will be filling them in

Furthermore the assessment of VR and ToL lacks rigor (lacking matched control condition)
- There is existing literature on AR and VR technologies that assess learning when additional didactic material (such as instructional pop ups) have been added (Pletz et al. 2020).

It is widely accepted that haptic feedback, spatialized audio, and added pedagogical overlays improve learning in virtual reality (…, …) . However much in the same way that one could learn stoichiometry via a textbook, an experiment, or a podcast listened to while riding the tube; the setting itself has been demonstrated to affect the “learning” itself. I do not aim to answer why virtual reality may be better at teaching something such as chemistry, but the extent to which a task learnt in virtual reality compared to the same task being taught not in VR.

  - Why VR may be better
Technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) refers to the specific features of a technology that can be used to support pedagogical methods (Mishra & Koehler, 2006).
Affordances of virtual reality technologies to make motor learning better than reality (Levac & Sveistrup, 2014)


## Remote Research Background

It would be naive to present a transfer report on HMD-VR literature without noting the "unprescedented" times (either - https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1425138850012168196 or BoJo) in which this PhD is being completed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mass causality, insummountable suffering, and for those who are left; global devastation that we shall be reaping throughout our lifetime.

It is not a silver lining that 'humanity came together in support' and it would be irreverent at best to claim that the maladies caused by the pandemic ****

Amid project cancellations and insecurity

Open Science practices boomed and infrustrature rose to meet it (citation)

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychometric and *** experiments moved to online mediums (Tsay, …. …. ….)

Unlike its counterparts, virtual reality experiments were halted due to hardware requirements of such experiments (ie. needing a HMD), and the potential cross-contamination concerns of sharing physical lab equipment between subjects.

A number of papers have been published on the construct validity of using remote proxies for collecting movement data (eg. keyboard and mouse) (....., .....). However it is as yet unknown if the factors found in an ‘out of lab’ virtual reality environment would confound or impact the validity of experimental results.

Allow the examination of experimental bias from “in lab”, and how that bias may VR affect the results seen and published within our field.

The studies proposed aim to contribute insight into this question.




## Project Aims
> to clearly state the research questions and project aims

### Intro section

As a field we need to fill in the gaps in our understanding of this technology and its uses through rigourous scientific inquiry.

### Key questions
Research Theme 1: Can we transfer skills learnt in VR to Natural


Research Theme 2: Can HMD based virtual reality experiments be conducted remotely and be valid for research purposes.

* Did one learn?
* Did one improve across trainings?
* What other behaviours are affected by those improvements (generalization)
* Can those improvements be observed in environments other than the one they were made in? (transfer)
* How long did those improvements last?


### How I plan to answer these questions
> to outline the experimental plan before getting into methods

A 3 phase plan to address the above questions.

Study 1 aims to assess transfer of learning by comparing performance and learning rates between VR in Natural laboratory settings on a novel task. The specific questions and hypotheses are below
*

Study 2 assesses the impact training 'at home in VR' has on performance. The specific questions and hypotheses are below
*



Study 3 will directly compare VR settings (either at home or in the lab) on task performance and outcome. As with above, the specific questions and hypotheses for study 3 are below:

- H0: the setting of the VR experiments has no impact on task performance and results
- H1: the setting has a statistically relevant impact on task performance and outcome

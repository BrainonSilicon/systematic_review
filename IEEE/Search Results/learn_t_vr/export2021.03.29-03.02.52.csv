PoEML is a modelling language that enables the modelling collaborative learning units. This middleware enables us to include tools from third-party providers in the environments provided to support collaborative learning activities. The main feature of this solution is that the e-learning platform can control the tools' operation in several ways by taking to account issues such as authorising users, creating instances, transferring data to and from the tool, assigning permissions to users, and subscribing to events. This paper illustrates the third-party provision of a special kind of tools in the context of the GameTel project: educational games.","","978-1-4244-7487-5","10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929295","","Games;Electronic learning;Business;Laboratories;Middleware;Authorization;Context","computer aided instruction;computer games;simulation languages","external provider;games integration;PoEML e-learning platform;modelling language;GameTel project;educational games","","","","12","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The TechEBook comprises the two worlds of classical circuit books and interactive operating platforms such as iPads, laptops and desktops. The TechEBook provides an interactive applets screen that holds many modules, each of which has a specific application in the self learning process. This paper describes one of the interactive techniques in the TechEBook known as Symbolic Circuit Solver (SymCirc). The SymCirc develops a versatile symbolic based linear circuit with a switches solver. The solver works by accepting a Netlist and the element that the user wants to find the voltage across or current on, as input parameters. Then it either produces the plot or the time domain expression of the output. Frequency domain plots or Symbolic Transfer Functions are also produced. The solver gets its input from a Web-based GUI circuit drawer developed at UCF. Typical simulation tools that electrical engineers encounter are numerical in nature, that is, when presented with an input circuit they iteratively solve the circuit across a set of small time steps. The result is represented as a data set of output versus time, which can be plotted for further inspection. Such results do not help users understand the ultimate nature of circuits as Linear Time Invariant systems with a finite dimensional basis in the solution space. SymCirc provides all simulation results as time domain expressions composed of the basic functions that exclusively include exponentials, sines, cosines and/or t raised to any power. This paper explains the motivation behind SymCirc, the Graphical User Interface front end and how the solver actually works. The paper also presents some examples and results to better explain the concept.","2165-9567","978-1-4673-1456-5","10.1109/EDUCON.2012.6201179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6201179","Symbolic Circuit Solver;Linear Circuits;Solver;Tool;Electrical Circuits;Interactive book","RLC circuits;Time domain analysis;Integrated circuit modeling;Transfer functions;Switches;Graphical user interfaces;Simulation","computer aided instruction;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;graphical user interfaces;interactive systems;Internet;Java","Java;symbolic circuit solver;electrical engineering curriculum;interactive technical electronic book;TechEBook;topic-driven module;classical circuit book;interactive operating platforms;iPads;laptops;desktops;interactive applets screen;self learning process;SymCirc;symbolic based linear circuit;switches solver;time domain expression;output. frequency domain plot;symbolic transfer function;Web-based GUI circuit drawer;UCF;linear time invariant system;finite dimensional basis;graphical user interface","","2","","4","","17 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a mechanism which represents the previous state of the system as a string. The user is allowed to define relevant information for better management as substrings. The adaptive workload model, which is called the SVR model (named after the first author's initials), predicts the short-term future as a string in which the information content (conveyed as a substring) reflects the future.

Model based learning filters designed from the inverse system transfer function can provide superior performance over single gain, P-type algorithms. These filters, however, can be excessively long if lightly damped zeros are inverted. In this paper, we propose a method for designing model based finite impulse response (FIR) learning filters. Based on the ILC injection point and discrete time system model, these filters are designed using the impulse responses of the inverse transfer function. We compare in simulation the ILC algorithms implemented at two different feedforward injection points and two different modeling methods. We show that the ILC algorithm injected at the reference signal and whose model is generated by discretizing the closed loop continuous time transfer function results in a learning filter with no lightly damped zeros. As a result, the learning filter has only two dominant filter taps much like the PD-type learning filter. We then implement these ILC algorithms on a wafer stage prototype. In this motion control application, we show that the model based ILC algorithm outperforms the P-type system in the plant injection architecture where longer FIR filters are needed for learning stability. We also show that the reference injection architecture provides superior performance to the plant injection for both model based and P-type ILC algorithms.","2378-5861","978-1-4244-4523-3","10.1109/ACC.2009.5160507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5160507","","Inverse problems;Finite impulse response filter;Transfer functions;Semiconductor device modeling;Control systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Performance gain;Iterative algorithms;Design methodology;Discrete time systems","adaptive control;closed loop systems;continuous time systems;discrete time systems;feedforward;FIR filters;iterative methods;learning systems;motion control;transfer functions","model inverse based iterative learning control;finite impulse response approximations;learning filter;inverse system transfer function;P-type algorithms;discrete time system model;feedforward injection points;closed loop continuous time transfer function;motion control","","14","","17","","10 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For these applications, the visual realism of fine-grained appearance details is crucial for production quality and user engagement. However, existing HPT methods often suffer from three fundamental issues: detail deficiency, content ambiguity and style inconsistency, which severely degrade the visual quality and realism of generated images. Aiming towards real-world applications, we develop a more challenging yet practical HPT setting, termed as Fine-grained Human Pose Transfer (FHPT), with a higher focus on semantic fidelity and detail replenishment. Concretely, we analyze the potential design flaws of existing methods via an illustrative example, and establish the core FHPT methodology by combing the idea of content synthesis and feature transfer together in a mutually-guided fashion. Thereafter, we substantiate the proposed methodology with a Detail Replenishing Network (DRN) and a corresponding coarse-to-fine model training scheme. Moreover, we build up a complete suite of fine-grained evaluation protocols to address the challenges of FHPT in a comprehensive manner, including semantic analysis, structural detection and perceptual quality assessment. Extensive experiments on the DeepFashion benchmark dataset have verified the power of proposed benchmark against start-of-the-art works, with 12%-14% gain on top-10 retrieval recall, 5% higher joint localization accuracy, and near 40% gain on face identity preservation.

Unfortunately, learning on robots is often difficult due to the large number of samples needed for many learning algorithms. Simulators are one way to decrease the samples needed from the robot by incorporating prior knowledge of the dynamics into the learning algorithm. In this paper we present a novel method for transferring data from a simulator to a robot, using simulated data as a prior for real-world learning. A Bayesian nonparametric prior is learned from a potentially black-box simulator. The mean of this function is used as a prior for the Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (PILCO) algorithm. The simulated prior improves the convergence rate and performance of PILCO by directing the policy search in areas of the state-space that have not yet been observed by the robot. Simulated and hardware results show the benefits of using the prior knowledge in the learning framework.","1050-4729","978-1-4799-6923-4","10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139550","","Heuristic algorithms;Robots;Data models;Gaussian processes;Hardware;Prediction algorithms;Mathematical model","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;nonparametric statistics;robots","reinforcement learning algorithm;informative simulated priors;autonomous learning;decision-making policy;controller design;Bayesian nonparametric prior;black-box simulator;probabilistic inference for learning control algorithm;PILCO algorithm;convergence rate","","27","","24","","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We used the resulting algorithm to optimise a z-transformed rational function representing the control policy. This representation facilitates simultaneous optimisation of the control structure and its parameters in time space and can be analysed in terms of control theory to predict the control behaviour for arbitrary scenarios.

These are important questions currently being encountered in the realm of virtual environment (VE) systems design. Applications of VE technology originally developed for use in advanced tactical aviation settings are currently being used as models for the development of neurosurgical interface concepts. While at first glance the connection between air combat and surgery may seem a distant one at best, there are many important similarities between them. For instance, both task domains share at least ten common, important human performance attributes, each of which may provide key insights into how to import knowledge gained from one domain into the other. Each of these areas have important implications for designing successful technical systems to support human performance. This paper explores the notion that general principles of interface design, derived from a concern with optimizing the above aspects of task performance, can be derived from the study of apparently disparate task domains.

The traditional transport paradigm used for ISDN is synchronous transfer mode (STM). However, the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) has attracted significant attention as a transport paradigm for B-ISDN. In comparison to STM, ATM is more flexible, and may have potential gain in bandwidth efficiency by buffering and statistically multiplexing bursty traffic at the expense of cell delay and loss.

If one method outperforms another in simulation, how likely is that trend to hold in reality on a robot? We examine this question for embodied PointGoal navigation - developing engineering tools and a research paradigm for evaluating a simulator by its sim2real predictivity. First, we develop Habitat-PyRobot Bridge (HaPy), a library for seamless execution of identical code on simulated agents and robots - transferring simulation-trained agents to a LoCoBot platform with a one-line code change. Second, we investigate the sim2real predictivity of Habitat-Sim M. Savva et al., for PointGoal navigation. We 3D-scan a physical lab space to create a virtualized replica, and run parallel tests of 9 different models in reality and simulation. We present a new metric called Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) to quantify predictivity. We find that SRCC for Habitat as used for the CVPR19 challenge is low (0.18 for the success metric), suggesting that performance differences in this simulator-based challenge do not persist after physical deployment. This gap is largely due to AI agents learning to exploit simulator imperfections - abusing collision dynamics to `slide' along walls, leading to shortcuts through otherwise non-navigable space. Naturally, such exploits do not work in the real world. Our experiments show that it is possible to tune simulation parameters to improve sim2real predictivity (e.g. improving SRCCSucc from 0.18 to 0.844) - increasing confidence that in-simulation comparisons will translate to deployed systems in reality.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2020.3013848","NSF; Air Force Research Laboratory; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; ONR YIPs; ARO PECASE; Amazon Catalyst; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158349","Visual-based navigation;reinforcement learning","Robots;Navigation;Task analysis;Predictive models;Correlation;Measurement","artificial intelligence;collision avoidance;computer simulation;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-agent systems;virtual reality","one-line code change;simulation predict Real-world performance;embodied PointGoal navigation;Habitat-PyRobot Bridge;robots-transferring simulation-trained agents;LoCoBot platform;Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient;Habitat-Sim M.

Hardware components like sensors(ultrasound sensors) are used to bring the virtuality in the Athynos game through the air selection process. The hand movements of the dyspraxia child are capture by the ultrasound sensor and using the Arduino the captured actions are transfer to the system as the input. The result of the dyspraxia children is analyzed by three or more trials and the report is calculated using the deep learning algorithm (linear regression).

With audio and video streaming platforms like Skype, Apple FaceTime, or Google Hangouts it is possible to stay in contact with friends and colleagues. However, these platforms only allow communication between two peers or at most in very small groups. Additionally, they are very inflexible regarding content sharing and support only limited, defined use cases. In this paper, we present an extension to our pervasive display service for a remote virtual environment. This allows an immersive participation at remote activities in larger groups, while retaining the flexibility regarding joining devices of a pervasive middleware. Our contributions are threefold. First, we present a reusable design for integrating an interactive display service into virtual environments. Second, we implement our approach using the BASE middleware and the Unity 3D engine.

The study was divided into two experiments with the same task: learning a 3D trajectory with accuracy. The first experiment was focused on evaluating the efficiency of three feedback schemes for the target trajectory: visual, haptic and visual-haptic feedback. The second experiment was focused on analyzing the influence of decreasing the feedback during the training process. The results suggest that the best learning condition for learning a 3D trajectory with accuracy is to provide visual-haptic feedback, which facilitates the understanding of the dimension and orientation of each trajectory segment and solves any visual discrepancies that may exist. Furthermore, although continuous feedback can create dependences in users and impede the transfer of motor skills, feedback based on user request can also be dangerous since users can create a wrong mental representation that keep them from replicating the trajectory accurately. Therefore, when the performance of a task depends on references created during the training process, it seems appropriate for the system to provide automatic feedback based on user performance.","","978-1-4244-6509-5","10.1109/HAVE.2010.5623979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623979","virtual training;motor skill transfer;virtual teaching;haptic feedback","Trajectory;Haptic interfaces;Visualization;Training;Three dimensional displays;Accuracy;Shape","haptic interfaces;knowledge representation;training;virtual reality;visual perception","training strategy;3D trajectory;motor skill transfer;visual-haptic feedback;trajectory segment;visual discrepancy;virtual reality","","3","","13","","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a method for human action recognition in videos using two convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The first one Spatial Stream (trained with frames of the video) and the second one Temporal Stream, trained with stacks of Dense Optical Flow (DOF). Both streams were trained separately and from both of them we generated a classification histogram based on the most frequent class assignment. For final classification, those histograms were combined to produce a single output. The technique was tested in two public action video datasets: Weizmann and UCF Sports.

In addition, a new tuple is formed through kernel function sampling to describe a robotic RL control problem. In this algorithm, a reward function is defined according to the features of tracking control in order to speed up the learning process, and then an RL tracking controller with a kernel-based transition dynamic model is proposed. Finally, a critic system is presented to evaluate the policy whether it is good or bad to the RL control tasks.

As in most machine learning methods, more samples generally mean better learning effectiveness. Sample collection for robotics application is a time-consuming process in addition to safety issues for both the robot itself and the environment surrounding it that come into play for real-world scenarios. Because of these limitations, sample efficiency plays a very vital role in the field of robotic learning. To deal with this, curriculum learning offers a methodology that allows robots to suffer less from the sample collection burden required, trying to keep it at a minimum. This study aims to tackle the sample inefficiency that deep reinforcement learning algorithms face in the domain of robotics by designing a curriculum. We propose an algorithm which decides on the sequence of tasks that the agent must learn to enable the transfer of knowledge in a sample-efficient manner towards the target task. Our algorithm performs a parameter-space task representation for the purpose of deciding on the difficultiness of the tasks. Once the difficulty level of each is determined, easy tasks are learned first before the final target task. We perform a study on a double inverted pendulum setup. Simulation results showed that transfer of knowledge via curriculum is more sample efficient than a direct transfer.","","978-1-7281-7709-0","10.1109/ICARCV50220.2020.9305338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9305338","","Task analysis;Robots;Reinforcement learning;Neural networks;Training;Trajectory;Heuristic algorithms","deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;pendulums;robot programming;robots","robotic learning;curriculum learning;deep reinforcement learning algorithms;sample-efficient manner;parameter-space task representation;autonomous curriculum generation;self-learning agents;machine learning;robotics application;inverted pendulum","","","","29","","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The subjects were separated into three groups: a no-training group, a virtual-training group using the present system, and a real-training group in real environments.

In this study, participants with a wide range of visual experience use the EyeCane and Virtual EyeCane to solve complex Hebb-Williams mazes in real and virtual environments. The EyeCane and its virtual counterpart are minimalistic sensory substitution devices that code single-point distance information into sound. We test whether participants improve performance in the real-to-virtual sequence: solve a real maze and subsequently improve performance in the virtual maze. We also test whether participants can sole a virtual maze and subsequently improve performance in the virtual world: the virtual-to-real sequence. We find that participants can use sensory substitution guided navigation to extract spatial information from the virtual world and apply it to significantly improve their behavioral performance in the real world and vice versa.

We propose a concept that utilises augmented reality techniques for increased immersion and motivation, while upholding the real-world sense of presence for an easy transfer of orientation skills to everyday life. For this purpose, we implemented a first prototypical serious game in the form of an AR scavenger hunt. A preliminary evaluation regarding its usability produced promising results.

In this paper, we address the above question by developing an electroencephalography (EEG) driven VR cybersickness prediction model. The EEG data has been widely utilized to learn the cognitive representation of brain activity. In the first stage, to fully exploit the advantages of the EEG data, it is transformed into the multi-channel spectrogram which enables to account for the correlation of spectral and temporal coefficient. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to encode the cognitive representation of the EEG spectrogram. In the second stage, we train a cybersickness prediction model on the VR video sequence by designing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Here, the encoded cognitive representation is transferred to the model to train the visual and cognitive features for cybersickness prediction. Through the proposed framework, it is possible to predict the cybersickness level that reflects brain activity automatically.

That is, the machine must be able to build up its skill in the domain automatically in the form of appropriate control actions triggered by the sensed state variables. In machine learning adaptive control the control scheme is independent of the mathematical modelling of the object dynamics and the precise estimation of its physical parameters. The article presents the authors own work, and that of others, on rules for controlling dynamic systems, and for designing robust rule-based controllers, efficient and adaptable, that has been applied in numerous simulations and to physical process control. The work reported catalogues experiments into intelligent control by human-supervised learning, passive learning, and machine learning. The work started with observing human-supervised learning, these observations led to the development of generalised rules for an automatic controller. Later, when this controller was applied to the physical system, the sensed outputs were post-processed by the c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm to demonstrate passive learning. Passive learning of this type provided feedback and allowed a direct comparison to be made between human and machine generated rules.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=181122","","Adaptive control;Digital control;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems","adaptive control;computerised control;knowledge based systems;learning systems","intelligent control;skill transfer;efficient control design;expert controller;machine learning adaptive control;robust rule-based controllers;human-supervised learning;passive learning;c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm;feedback","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads. The dyads experiment in a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) scenario to move an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment to reach predefined goal configurations. In this study, we propose a sliding-window approach for feature extraction and demonstrate the online classification methodology to identify interaction patterns. We evaluate our approach using 1) a support vector machine classifier (SVMc) and 2) a Gaussian Process classifier (GPc) for multi-class classification, and achieve over 80% accuracy with both classifiers when identifying general interaction types.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2945261","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854968","Classification;Feature Extraction;Force and Tactile Sensing;Haptics and Haptic Interfaces;Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop;Learning and Adaptive Systems;Physical Human-Human Interaction;Physical Human-Robot Interaction;Recognition","Task analysis;Collaboration;Haptic interfaces;Feature extraction;Robots;Microsoft Windows;Taxonomy","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;image classification;robot vision;support vector machines;virtual reality","interaction state;physical interactions;interaction patterns;physical human-human interaction;general interaction types;interaction behaviors;collaborative object transfer;joint object transfer;online identification;haptic data;industrial settings;object co-manipulation;haptics-enabled virtual environment;sliding-window approach;feature extraction;online classification methodology;support vector machine classifier;SVMc;Gaussian process classifier;multiclass classification;general interaction type identification;automatic classification mechanism","","","","27","IEEE","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is however difficult to learn, teach and assess. More must be understood about the skills involved in palpation. The present study compares the ability of practicing veterinarians and veterinary students to identify stiffness values. An absolute identification paradigm was used where a force-feedback device rendered virtual surfaces with 5 levels of stiffness within a ldquoclinically relevantrdquo range of 0.2 - 0.5 N/mm. The results from 12 veterinarians and 14 veterinary students show that the veterinarians performed significantly better than the students (p Lt 0.001). The mean information transfer was 0.97 bits (almost 2 perfectly-identifiable stiffness levels) for the veterinarians and 0.58 bits (1 correctly-identified stiffness level) for the students. However, neither group was able to reliably identify more than 2 levels of stiffness, indicating that the success of veterinarians in clinical practice probably relies on additional properties such as size, shape and texture. Our findings suggest that stiffness perception in the context of veterinary medicine is a learned clinical skill. Quantifying expert ability will help inform teaching methods and set targets for students. Similar psychophysical methods can also be used to monitor student performance throughout the learning process. Future work will examine the contributions of other object properties as well as motor strategies to palpation performance.","","978-1-4244-3858-7","10.1109/WHC.2009.4810800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810800","palpation;stiffness identification;comparison of experts and novices;veterinary medical education;haptics","Haptic interfaces;Medical simulation;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pregnancy;Education;Virtual reality;Educational institutions;Breast cancer;Cows;Psychology","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;force feedback;haptic interfaces;medical diagnostic computing;rendering (computer graphics);teaching;touch (physiological);veterinary medicine;virtual reality","haptic stiffness perception identification;veterinary medicine;palpation;medical health profession;force-feedback device;virtual surface rendering;mean information transfer;clinical skill learning;teaching method;psychophysical method;motor strategy;virtual reality haptic simulation;medical diagnosis","","11","","26","","3 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

Performance of these systems relies on the availability of high quality training sets, containing a large number of examples (e.g. million), in addition to the the machine learning tools themselves. For several applications, very good training sets can be obtained, for example, crawling (noisily) annotated images from the internet, or by analyzing user interaction (e.g.: on social networks). However, there are several applications for which high quality training sets are not easy to be obtained/created. Consider, as an example, a security scenario where one wants to automatically detect rarely occurring threatening events. In this respect, recently, researchers investigated the possibility of using a visual virtual environment, capable of artificially generating controllable and photo-realistic contents, to create training sets for applications with little available training images. We explored this idea to generate synthetic photo-realistic training sets to train classifiers to recognize the proper use of individual safety equipment (e.g.: worker protection helmets, high-visibility vests, ear protection devices) during risky human activities. Then, we performed domain adaptation to real images by using a very small image data set of real-world photographs.

This gap mainly stems from two factors: 1) The absence of a controller, making the data collected dissimilar to actual control. 2) The difficulty of including the four main dynamic factors (gesture intensity, limb position, electrode shift, and transient changes in the signal), as including their permutations drastically increases the amount of data to be recorded. Contrarily, online datasets are limited to the exact EMG-based controller used to record them, necessitating the recording of a new dataset for each control method or variant to be tested. Consequently, this paper proposes a new type of dataset to serve as an intermediate between off line and online datasets, by recording the data using a real-time experimental protocol. The protocol, performed in virtual reality, includes the four main dynamic factors and uses an EMG-independent controller to guide movements. This EMG-independent feedback ensures that the user is in-the-loop during recording, while enabling the resulting dynamic dataset to be used as an EMG-based benchmark. The dataset is comprised of 20 able-bodied participants completing three to four sessions over a period of 14 to 21 days. The ability of the dynamic dataset to serve as a benchmark is leveraged to evaluate the impact of different-recalibration techniques for long-term (across-day) gesture recognition, including a novel algorithm, named TADANN. TADANN consistently and significantly (p <; 0.05) outperforms using fine-tuning as the recalibration technique.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3059741","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en sante et en sécurité du travail (IRSST); Research Council of Norway; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354785","EMG;myoelectric control;gesture recognition;leap motion;transfer learning;virtual reality","Protocols;Virtual reality;Gesture recognition;Electromyography;Three-dimensional displays;Real-time systems;Heuristic algorithms","electromyography;medical signal processing;neural nets;virtual reality","transferable adaptive domain adversarial neural network;virtual reality augmented EMG-based gesture recognition;electromyography-based gesture recognition;real-time usability;gesture intensity;online datasets;exact EMG-based controller;control method;real-time experimental protocol;EMG-independent controller;EMG-independent feedback;dynamic dataset;EMG-based benchmark","","","","62","CCBY","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A cyclic model of knowledge transfer is invariant for all subjects of the joint scientific and educational processes and can be implemented in academic centers of excellence to acquire and create knowledge through the partnership of students, teachers, and researchers. Furthermore we describe our experience with the deployment of a transdisciplinary environment based on the knowledge transfer cycle in the annual scientific course `Technologies of High Performance Computing and Computer Simulation' (ITMO University, Russia).","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044290","knowledge transfer;knowledge management;learning environments;transdisciplinary education","Knowledge transfer;Technological innovation;Educational institutions;Collaboration;Knowledge engineering","computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;engineering education;further education;knowledge management","knowledge economy;higher engineering education;modern learning process;rapid obsolescence;knowledge-intensive educational activities;life-long learning;computer-aided transdisciplinary learning environments;student intrinsic motivation;knowledge transfer cyclic model;scientific processes;educational processes;academic centers;student-teacher-esearcher partnership;technologies of high performance computing and computer simulation;ITMO University;Russia","","1","","28","","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And if so, what role should a virtual teacher play and what skills should he have? We describe several advantages that virtual environment (VE) has as compared to an ordinary classroom. It enables children to explore a phenomenon involved and gives them a strong incentive to study. Further, in VE we can transfer a lesson to inaccessible places and carry out demonstrations and experiments that are unrealizable on Earth. We consider the relationship between VST and game-like environments. We present some particular educational applications developed at our institute on the basis of Avango VR-system.

In particular, the desired trolley position can be iteration dependent, and the desired cable length of the crane system can be both iteration and time varying. The trolley position, cable length, and the swing angle of the cable are subject to user-defined constraints during the operation. The path planning algorithm presented in this work relaxes the traditional assumptions regarding system initial conditions in the ILC literature. We show that the control objective can be achieved asymptotically over the iteration domain, beyond a user-defined finite time interval in each iteration of operation. The constraint requirements are satisfied during the operation. In the end a simulation example further demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","2378-5861","978-1-5386-8266-1","10.23919/ACC45564.2020.9147317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9147317","","Cranes;Containers;Trajectory;Iterative learning control;Indexes;Computer crashes;Process control","adaptive control;cranes;iterative methods;learning systems;path planning;position control;trolleys","AILC;crane load lowering;crane trolley;container crane systems;adaptive iterative learning control;uncalm sea conditions;crane load transferring;iteration domain;cable length;trolley position","","","","22","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through training on a large-scale video dataset, most existing approaches aim to explore disentangled appearance and pose representations of training frames. Then, the desired output with a specific appearance and pose can be synthesized via recombining learned representations. However, in some real-world applications, test images may lack the corresponding video ground-truth or follow a different distribution than the distribution of the training video frames (i.e., different domains), which largely limit the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose domain-independent pose representations that are compatible with and accessible by still images from a different domain. Specifically, we devise a two-stage self-supervised pose adaptation framework for general image animation tasks. A domain-independent pose adaptation generative adversarial network (DIPA-GAN) and a shuffle-patch generative adversarial network (Shuffle-patch GAN) are proposed to penalize the rationality of the synthesized frame's pose and appearance, respectively. Finally, experiments evaluated on various image animation tasks, which include same/cross-domain moving objects, facial expression transfer and human pose retargeting, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over prior literature. Impact Statement-Image animation is a popular technology in video production. Benefiting from the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), recent image animation algorithms have been widely used in real-world applications, such as virtual AI news anchor, virtual try-on, and face swapping. However, most existing methods are designed for specific cases. To animate a new portrait, users are asked to collect hundreds of images of the same person and train a new model. The technology proposed in this paper overcomes these training limitations and generalizes image animations. In the challenging cross-domain facial expression transfer task, the user study demonstrated that our technology achieved more than 20% increase in animation success rate. The proposed technology could benefit users in a wide variety of industries including movie production, virtual reality, social media and online retail.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2020.3031581","Australian Research Council Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229197","Adversarial learning;deep learning;representation learning","Animation;Task analysis;Training;Generative adversarial networks;Artificial intelligence;Solid modeling;Adaptation models","computer animation;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pose estimation;video signal processing;virtual reality","cross-domain image animation;video sequence;large-scale video dataset;learned representations;adaptation framework;general image animation tasks;adaptation generative adversarial network;shuffle-patch generative adversarial network;synthesized frame;video production;animation success rate;cross-domain facial expression transfer task;image animation algorithm;video ground-truth","","","","59","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, synthesising such controllers, even for a single objective, is a demanding process. In this paper, we present a novel and straightforward approach to synthesising these policies through a combination of trajectory optimisation, homotopy continuation, and imitation learning. We use numerical continuation to efficiently generate optimal demonstrations across several objectives and boundary conditions, and use these to train our policies. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our policies to effectively learn families of optimal state- feedback controllers, which can be used to change objective functions online. We illustrate this approach across two trajectory optimisation problems, an inverted pendulum swingup and a spacecraft orbit transfer, and show that the synthesised policies, when evaluated in simulation, produce trajectories that are near-optimal. These results indicate the benefit of trajectory optimisation and homotopy continuation to the synthesis of controllers in dynamic-objective contexts.","2576-2370","978-1-7281-7447-1","10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9303931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303931","Optimal Control;Deep Learning;Homotopy;Online Planning","Trajectory;Optimization;Optimal control;Linear programming;Boundary conditions;Robots;Process control","control system synthesis;learning systems;optimal control;pendulums;state feedback;trajectory optimisation (aerospace)","optimal trajectories;optimal state-feedback controllers;homotopy continuation;imitation learning;boundary conditions;trajectory optimisation problems;policy synthesis;dynamic-objective policy learning;spacecraft orbit transfer;inverted pendulum swingup;near-optimal trajectories","","","","31","","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As open forms of teaching we used blended learning, open space technology (OST) and selected elements of gamification. Game-based learning approaches posit that learners who interact with educational materials with playful and dynamic tasks will learn better. To better understand improvement of teamwork, social skills and collaboration a specific business game with a defined amount of play tokens is introduced. Within this business game all participants (n = 22) will have to form interdisciplinary project teams to manage a professional 3D-visualization task. In three subsequent project stages (concept, development and implementation) all projects are continually evaluated and the teams are appropriately rewarded with play tokens. With these play tokens every team can purchase missing know-how or hire additional workforce. The final visualization project is evaluated by specific design criteria (qualitative) and by the remaining amount of play tokens (quantitative). The concept of a business game was a visible success. Open forms of teaching, such as blended learning and open space technology promote the active acquisition of basic knowledge, technical understanding and at least increase transfer competence. A continuous and transparent evaluation makes the individual learning progress directly tangible. Students who took part in the business game reported more enjoyment in learning the 3D visualization pipeline than students from the years before. The business game induced greater interest to the students in acquiring new content more easily and quickly than in the other courses. Also their high degree of personal responsibility led to outstanding new ideas and their own initiatives.","2474-0489","978-1-7281-4540-2","10.1109/VS-Games.2019.8864595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864595","Game-based learning;Collaborative learning;Participatory design;Virtual reality;Computer games","Games;Business;Education;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Teamwork;Animation","computer aided instruction;computer games;data visualisation;teaching","interactive architectural visualization;social skills;blended learning;game-based learning approaches;business game;play tokens;open space technology;teaching;gamification;professional 3D-visualization task","","","","22","","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Key to our approach is to perform system identification of the model parameters μ of the hardware (e.g. friction, center-of-mass) in two distinct stages, before policy learning (pre-sysID) and after policy learning (post-sysID). Pre-sysID begins by collecting trajectories from the physical hardware based on a set of generic motion sequences. Because the trajectories may not be related to the task of interest, presysID does not attempt to accurately identify the true value of μ, but only to approximate the range of μ to guide the policy learning. Next, a Projected Universal Policy (PUP) is created by simultaneously training a network that projects μ to a low-dimensional latent variable η and a family of policies that are conditioned on η. The second round of system identification (post-sysID) is then carried out by deploying the PUP on the robot hardware using task-relevant trajectories. We use Bayesian Optimization to determine the values for η that optimize the performance of PUP on the real hardware. We have used this approach to create three successful biped locomotion controllers (walk forward, walk backwards, walk sideways) on the Darwin OP2 robot.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968053","","","Bayes methods;humanoid robots;learning systems;legged locomotion;motion control;optimisation;robot dynamics","PUP;biped locomotion controllers;dynamic robot control policies;system identification;policy learning;pre-sysID;motion sequences;presysID;post-sysID;robot hardware;task-relevant trajectories;sim-to-real transfer;projected universal policy;Bayesian optimization","","6","","36","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such authentic problems have enormous potential for learning as they are real and will probably arise in the controller's real work. Resolving authentic problems on a simulator encourages transfer by demonstrating when the knowledge is useful and by showing the effect of the learner's actions. However this process is difficult, since authentic problems tend to require a wide range of knowledge which often lead the learner in activities beyond their abilities. Some support is required for learning from simulation to occur. Sometimes this support is provided by human tutors (in ATC training for example this support is provided by a human instructor sitting at the back of the controller during the running of an exercise on the simulator), this support could also be given by a computer learning environment. This paper presents an intelligent simulator-based learning environment for air traffic controllers which provides a protected and guided environment to the learner. One central element of this environment is the ability to evaluate the learner's skills. We describe our approach to the evaluation of learner's skills, which uses task performance as well as situation complexity and degree of task practice as a means for building an overlay model of the learner.","1062-922X","0-7803-3280-6","10.1109/ICSMC.1996.565492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=565492","","Humans;Problem-solving;Availability;Intelligent systems;Context modeling;Intelligent structures;Performance evaluation;Air traffic control","air traffic control;aerospace simulation;digital simulation;computer based training;computer aided instruction;user modelling","learner skill evaluation;dynamic complex systems;air traffic control;ATC;human tutors;intelligent simulator-based learning environment;task performance;situation complexity","","1","1","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We derive four potential factors affecting the performance of haptic feedback (calculation operator, maximum displacement, offset force, and scaling factor), which are analyzed in three compliance identification experiments. First, we analyze the principle usability of pseudo-haptic feedback by comparing information transfer measures for teleoperation and direct interaction. Pseudo-haptic interaction yields well above-chance performance, while direct interaction performs almost perfectly. In order to optimize pseudo-haptic feedback, in the second study we perform a full-factorial experimental design with 36 subjects performing 6,480 trials with 36 different treatments. Information transfer ranges from 0.68 bit to 1.72 bit in a task with a theoretical maximum of 2.6 bit, with a predominant effect of the calculation operator and a minor effect of the maximum displacement. In a third study, short- and long-term learning effects are analyzed. Learning effects regarding the performance of pseudo-haptic feedback cannot be observed for single-day experiments. Tests over 10 days show a maximum increase in information transfer of 0.8 bit. The results show the feasibility of pseudo-haptic feedback for teleoperation and can be used as design basis for task-specific systems.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2016.2557331","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457685","Haptics;pseudo-haptics;teleoperation;medical robotics","Haptic interfaces;Force;Iron;Manipulators;Actuators;Couplings;Virtual environments","haptic interfaces;medical robotics;surgery;telerobotics;virtual reality","pseudo-haptic feedback;teleoperation system;virtual reality;calculation operator;maximum displacement;offset force;scaling factor;compliance identification experiments;information transfer measures;direct interaction;minimal invasive surgery","Adult;Computer Simulation;Equipment Design;Feedback;Female;Humans;Learning;Male;Robotic Surgical Procedures;Robotics;Telemedicine;Touch;User-Computer Interface","9","","29","","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we investigate the image features of the 360-degree videos and the contextual information of the viewpoint trajectories. Specifically, we design ladder convolution to adapt for the distorted image, and propose LadderNet to transfer the knowledge from the pre-trained model and retrieve the features from the distorted image. We then combine the image features and the contextual viewpoints as the inputs for long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the future viewpoints. Our approach is compared with several state-of-the-art viewpoint prediction algorithms over two 360-degree video datasets.

Currently, the conventional lecture format is the dominant educational method used, with the main principle being that of information transfer. As the required knowledge base increases, so the ability of the students to effectively absorb and use information is reduced. There is, therefore, an identifiable need to establish alternative modes of learning for students. To address this challenge, Strathclyde University has developed an approach to professional simulations called SIMPLE (SIMulated Professional Learning Environment). One aspect of the project focuses on developing an interactive digital, simulated learning environment to enable postgraduate Architecture students to learn some aspects of the Management, Practice and Law syllabus. This paper describes the design, pedagogical structure, implementation and evaluation of the SIMPLE simulation within this module.

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is one method of information exchange that is especially suitable for various front-end devices to read information. This paper aims to assess a ubiquitous learning environment through RSS and analyze communication media richness with RSS, SMS and E-mail based on media richness theory. Moreover, in order to evaluate the preferences toward using RSS into ubiquitous learning environment, student satisfaction is also assessed. Experimental results revealed that ubiquitous learning system by using RSS can greatly promote instructor-learners interaction and learners participation in curriculum activities but have no influence in learners cognition and metacognition. In terms of media richness, RSS is more suitable media for ubiquitous learning environment.

Senior medical students completed analogous sets of virtual patient cases in different sequences, and their case performance was tracked. A follow-up user satisfaction survey was conducted. A significant effect of case sequencing on analogy transfer was seen only with respect to correct treatment scores (p = . 009). Explicit case comparison had no reliable effect on performance. However, diagnostic accuracy increased (p les .002) while treatment attempts decreased (p = . 05) when subjects were prompted to write case summaries. Satisfaction with the patient simulation program was high. Manipulating case sequences and supporting explicit case comparison yielded mixed results.

This paper describes the design of a conceptual model and development of a software platform to allow learners to collaborate online in discussing PBL cases. Early testing has been extremely promising, largely due to the extensive work done earlier to build the ENJEUX-S online game platform. Thanks to this work, it has been possible to extend this platform from online games to online simulations. Our first test of the PBL model with undergraduate students was successful in facilitating their critical thinking and was well-received. We are now planning to use COMPSoft in medical schools and to conduct comprehensive evaluation studies of both the model and the platform.","","978-1-4244-4680-3","10.1109/ICCGI.2009.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280074","problem-based learning;PBL;COMPsoft;online platform;medical education;simulation;online education","Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Medical simulation;Collaborative work;Education;International collaboration;Collaborative software;Testing;Medical services;Information technology;Computational modeling","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;digital simulation;groupware;Internet;medical computing","medical education;COMPsoft;problem-based learning;ENJEUX-S online game platform;medical schools;collaborative online problem-based simulation platform;software platform","","2","","28","","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An algorithm for self-calibration of a precision voltage calibrator is discussed. The basic concept is that the history of deviations in measured voltage differences during the calibration period can be taken as a learning period for a neural network which can numerically correct particular reference elements later in the working period. Results are obtained by simulation, and evaluated on the basis of real measurement data and simulated input functions. Hardware solutions are discussed.<>","","0-7803-0640-6","10.1109/IMTC.1992.245063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=245063","","Voltage;Calibration;Instruments;Neural networks;Particle measurements;Measurement standards;Law;Fluctuations;Proposals;Measurement uncertainty","built-in self test;calibration;computerised instrumentation;digital simulation;learning systems;measurement standards;neural nets;voltage measurement","learning algorithm;self-calibration;voltage calibrator;measurement uncertainty;DC voltage reference module;working standard;deviations;voltage differences;neural network;simulation","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model has been provided with a set of images, wherein each image, a person will be performing an activity such as standing, sitting, bending, waving, or sleeping. The label of an image will be the activity that is being performed in those images. The model will learn this relationship, and then it can predict the label of an input that it has never seen. The model is trained and tested with a dataset consisting of random images downloaded from the internet.","","978-1-7281-7089-3","10.1109/ICISS49785.2020.9315962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9315962","Object detection;human action recognition;faster R-CNN;machine learning;transfer learning","Training;Computational modeling;Object detection;Proposals;Solid modeling;Feature extraction;Predictive models","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image motion analysis;image recognition;image sequences;object detection;virtual reality","human action sequences;human action detection;virtual reality interfaces;surveillance systems;object detection algorithms;deep neural network-based classifiers;random images;qualitative prediction;HAD;internet","","","","25","","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Another application of it is the website of video lectures for graduate students as a part of blended learning. To deliver streaming videos to more than 100 students simultaneously, we need to configure quality of encoding streaming videos and estimate the amount of transferring data and the network traffic load.

Essay and string responses in the IMathAS homework system have to be manually graded, making the free response questions difficult to generate instant feedback. The ability to write questions with automatic feedback during active lecture offer improvements to the current systems and provide an opportunity for critical thinking to occur. The following study provides framework for an interpretive neural network to be implemented into any IMathAS system. These responses can be in the form of equations, words and sentences, or pictures. Findings show that correctly trained networks using manually graded artifacts can be more than 90% accurate in providing feedback to a correct answer in student practice, allowing for lessons that guide students towards correct and well-phrased answers using their own words, and can even assign partial credit. The findings imply that Marzano's taxonomy level of analysis can be reached using the IMathAS system and that critical thinking methods can be directly applied for scoring. When integrated into the existing system, simulation-based or mixed reality homework can have free responses and the grades can be transferred via learning tool interoperability connection into the institutional learning management system for direct scoring in the gradebook.","","978-1-7281-4899-1","10.1109/ISMCR47492.2019.8955695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955695","neural networks;mixed reality education application;critical thinking;undergraduate education","Neural networks;Mathematical model;Training;Tungsten;Software","computer aided instruction;interactive systems;Internet;open systems","IMathAS homework system;interpretive neural network;IMathAS system;critical thinking methods;mixed reality homework;institutional learning management system;free response evaluation;simulation learning;interactive class;learning tool interoperability connection","","","","16","","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

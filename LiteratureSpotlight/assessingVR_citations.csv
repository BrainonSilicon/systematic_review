An Approach for Assessing Training Effectiveness in Virtual Reality Environments,Virtual reality environments fall within the spectrum of training technologies currently available to promote knowledge transfer and skill development. The strength of virtual environments lies in their ability to portray the real-world operational system as an interactive multimodal environment. The degree of the similarity between the operational and virtual environments is typically described as system fidelity. We propose a statistical approach to assess the knowledge transfer and skill development by comparing the degree of theoretical mismatch between the virtual training environment and the actual operational environment based on physical cue fidelity and neurophysiological response mismatch. The proposed approach also enables identification of potential causes of response mismatches and provides systematic guidance to reduce the number of mismatch occurrences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There are increasing new advances in virtual reality technologies as well as a rise in learning virtual environments for which several studies highlighted the pedagogical value, knowledge transfer, and learners' engaged-behaviors. Moreover, the notion of user experience is now abundant in the scientific literature without the fact that there are specific models for immersive environments. This paper aims at proposing and validating a model of User experience in immersive Virtual Environment, including virtual learning environments. The model is composed of 10 components extracted from existing models (i.e., presence, engagement, immersion, flow, usability, skill, emotion, experience consequence, judgement, and technology adoption). It was validated in a user study involving 152 participants who were asked to use the edutainment application Think and Shoot and to complete an immersive virtual environment questionnaire. The findings lead us to a modified user experience model questioning new paths between user experience components (e.g., the influence of experience consequence on flow).

The focus of this paper is not to present a simulator that replaces those existing tools on the market, but to describe the development of a prototype for testing skill acquisition and transfer. The study reflects the experience of using a game engine to develop a VTS for an earthmoving excavator in a construction site. The development was initiated after exploring critical aspects of training.

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package. RiskMan uses socket connections to feed information between the Narrative Engine and Sim Master to Unreal Tournament Game Engine (UT2004).. © 2006 IEEE.",Games; Risk analysis; Simulation; Training,"Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer systems; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision support systems; Education; Engineering research; Engines; Expert systems; Finance; Game theory; Industrial research; Information technology; Insurance; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge engineering; Law enforcement; Linguistics; Management; Management information systems; Mergers and acquisitions; Multi agent systems; Natural language processing systems; Planning; Quality assurance; Reliability; Research; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risks; Safety engineering; Strategic planning; Technology; Technology transfer; Virtual reality; (p ,p ,t) measurements; agent technologies; computer games; game engines; General Accounting Office (GAO); High-risk situations; Higher education (HE); Homeland security (HLS); international conferences; Learning experiences; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Police officers; risk handling; risk identification; Scenario development; Scenario-based training; Scripting languages; Socket connections; System architectures; Tacit knowledge; Technology based; training simulation; training systems; Unreal Tournament (TM); VR systems; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949096083,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technol. Laboratory, University of Houston, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, United States, Institute for Defense Analyses, Alexandria, VA, United States","The use of virtual reality (VR) technology in training and education is an extension of 50 years of flight simulation research. As virtual reality becomes integrated into medical practices, the same questions that confronted the developers of flight simulation also apply to those in the medical domain. Does this technology work for training and education? If so, how well does it work? How much does it cost? Is it less expensive than the alternative training methods? In order to answer these questions the authors have taken a look at the same problems in the history of military simulation. The four techniques used to assess the value of military simulation have been, and still are, task analyses (a detailed, timed description of the actual tasks), standard experimental designs (i.e. the pre-test, post-test control group design), transfer-of-training experiments (where the evaluation metric is the actual task) and various combinations of the three. At present the only evaluation technique being used for VR in medical education is the task analysis.",Standard experimental designs; Task analyses; Transfer effectiveness ratio; Transfer of training,article; computer simulation; human; medical education; medical practice; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; surgical training; virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030992792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on the detection, diagnosis, and recovery from unexpected situations frequently arising during normal operation. The teleprogramming system employs a single thread approach to error recovery that is inherent in the system design. We perform two experimental tasks, each highlighting a different role for the operator, using the teleprogramming system with a simulated communication time delay of 10 seconds. In the first task of inserting and extracting bolts, the operator assumes the role of ""task level reasoning"" or task planning and sequencing, task state reasoning, and diagnostic procedure generation. In the second task, puncturing and slicing duct tape, the operator performs ""action level reasoning"" or diagnosing and correcting unexpected situations and determining success of actions. Our experimental results indicate that complex tasks can be accomplished when the operator is provided multiple and overlapping forms of feedback.<>","","0-7803-1933-8","10.1109/IROS.1994.407425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=407425","","Delay effects;Force control;Mechanical sensors;Virtual environment;Motion control;Displacement control;Force feedback;Force sensors;Robot sensing systems;Yarn","telerobotics;man-machine systems;delays;inference mechanisms;fault diagnosis;planning (artificial intelligence);user interfaces;virtual reality;system recovery","task execution error;time delayed teleoperation;teleprogramming system;supervisory control;operator interaction;virtual environment;remote manipulator;error detection;fault diagnosis;error recovery;task level reasoning;task planning;action level reasoning;feedback","","4","1","16","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most machine learning techniques, human motor behavior is modeled as a generic stochastic process. However, the integration of a priori knowledge about underlying system structures can provide insights on otherwise unobservable intrinsic states that yield the superior prediction performance and increased generalization capabilities. Methods: We present a novel method for modeling human motor behavior that explicitly includes a neuroscientifically supported model of human motor control, in which the dynamics of the human arm are modeled by a mechanical impedance that tracks a latent desired trajectory. We adopt a Bayesian setting by defining Gaussian process (GP) priors for the impedance elements and the latent desired trajectory. This enables exploitation of a priori human arm impedance knowledge for regression of interaction forces through inference of a latent desired human trajectory. Results: The method is validated using simulated data, with particular focus on effects of GP prior parameterization and intention estimation capabilities. The superior prediction performance is shown with respect to a naive GP prior. An experiment with human participants evaluates generalization capabilities and effects of training data sparsity. Conclusion: We derive the correlations of an impedance-based GP model of human motor behavior that exploits a priori knowledge. Significance: The model effectively predicts interaction forces by inferring a latent desired human trajectory in previously observed as well as unobserved regions of the input space.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2018.2890710","ERC Starting; Control based on Human Models; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599006","Bayesian modeling;Gaussian processes;human motor control;human motor intention;human robot interaction;impedance;kernel structure","Impedance;Trajectory;Task analysis;Robots;Gaussian processes;Correlation;Motor drives","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;human-robot interaction;regression analysis","nonphysical interaction;human motor intention;human-robot interaction tasks;generic stochastic process;neuroscientifically supported model;human motor control;a priori human arm impedance knowledge;latent desired human trajectory;intention estimation capabilities;impedance-based GP model;human motor behavior;impedance-based Gaussian processes;Bayesian setting","Adult;Algorithms;Arm;Computer Simulation;Electric Impedance;Female;Humans;Intention;Male;Models, Biological;Movement;Normal Distribution;Psychomotor Performance;Young Adult","1","","53","Traditional","1 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key elements of this tool are a simulator and real face and background images taken under real-world conditions with different acquisition conditions. Inside the simulated environment, an observing agent, the one with the ability to recognize faces, can navigate and observe the real face images, at different distances, angles and with indoor or outdoor illumination. During the face recognition process, the agent can actively change its viewpoint and relative distance to the faces in order to improve the recognition results. The virtual environment provides all behaviors to the agent (navigation, positioning, face's image composing under different angles, etc.), except the ones related with the recognition of faces. This tool could be of high interest in HRI applications related with the visual recognition of humans. It allows comparing and quantifying the face recognition capabilities of service robots, and in general intelligent machines, under exactly equal working conditions. The applicability of the proposed tool is validated in the comparison of state of the art face detection and recognition methods.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-7990-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598673","","Face;Face recognition;Databases;Lighting;Testing;Detectors;Face detection","face recognition;human-robot interaction;robot vision;service robots;virtual reality","virtual environment;realistic testing;realistic training;face detection systems;face recognition systems;human-robot interaction;service robots;intelligent machines","","1","","30","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new requirements for high-level realistic visualization and online analysis tools of ABM simulations raise key issues that are yet unsolved: how to visualize interaction between entities and more generally abstracting the key information from the system dynamics. Instead of ad-hoc existing approaches that require reification in the model, we propose an approach dedicated to visualize and discover emerging dynamics from the model. In this approach, the execution of the simulation and its representation is separated and building a visualization is like building a visualization model on top of the reference model. The techniques presented here have been implemented in an Agent-based simulation platform, Gama, and illustrate the new perspective on visualization in Agent-based Modeling.","","978-1-4799-1350-3","10.1109/RIVF.2013.6719899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719899","Agent-based model;visualization;interaction;online analysis;3D;complex systems","Data models;Analytical models;Visualization;Abstracts;Data visualization;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling","data analysis;data visualisation;digital simulation;multi-agent systems","model-view-controller approach;high-level realistic visualization;online data analysis;agent-based simulation;Gama;agent-based modeling","","4","","18","","23 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Only those segmented objects are merged with the remote reality, enabling this way to increase self-presence and to allow user interaction.

Designing surgical simulators, however, poses the challenge of creating trainers that effectively instill not only high-level understanding of the steps to be taken in a given situation, but also the low-level âmuscle-memoryâ needed to perform delicate surgical procedures. It is often impossible to build an ideal simulator that perfectly mimics the haptic experience of a surgical procedure, but by focussing on the aspects of the experience that are perceptually salient we can build simulators that effectively instill learning. We propose a general method for the design of surgical simulators that augment the perceptually salient aspects of an interaction. Using this method, we can increase skill-transfer rates without requiring expensive improvements in the capability of the rendering hardware or the computational complexity of the simulation. In this paper, we present our decomposition-based method for surgical simulator design, and describe a user-study comparing the training effectiveness of a haptic-search-task simulator designed using our method versus an unaugmented simulator. The results show that perception-based task decomposition can be used to improve the design of surgical simulators that effectively impart skill by targeting perceptually significant aspects of the interaction.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2011.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975145","Haptic I/O;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;life and medical sciences;surgical simulation.","Haptic interfaces;Surgery;Training;Needles;Rendering (computer graphics);Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","augmented reality;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;surgery","perceptually augmented simulator design;training simulator;air-traffic control;piloting;nuclear power station monitoring;surgical simulator;low-level muscle-memory;surgical procedure;haptic experience;salient interaction aspect;skill-transfer rate;rendering hardware;computational complexity;decomposition-based method;user study;haptic-search-task simulator;unaugmented simulator;perception-based task decomposition","","2","","21","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Agent-based simulation enables insights with regards to the emergent behavior of the individual combatants, groups of combatants, or the system as a whole.

The system allows customization by the experiment administrator according to their specific requirements. A visual clutter analysis method known as Feature Congestion is utilized to analyze the visual clutter of video scene and optimized trying to meet the requirements of real-time operation. Different optimization techniques such as multithreading, general computation using GPU, fast matrix convolution are explored. The theoretical improvement and limitations of the optimizations have been discussed. By utilizing JavaScript and HTML, this browser-based platform is designed to be cross-platform and extensible.

While small-sized scenarios are relatively easy to explore and analyze, larger scenarios need specialized treatment for efficient execution. The simulation challenges of speed and scale become pronounced when network sizes are very large (millions of road intersections) and/or vehicular traffic load is immense (several million simultaneously active vehicles). Commonly used execution approaches roughly correspond to the two extremes of the simulation spectrum. Aggregate models correspond to one extreme, typically employed to achieve coarse results at a relatively high simulation speed. Micro-simulation represents the other extreme, employed for finer granularity at the expense of greatly decreased simulation speed. Hybrid methods are emerging as via media that provide medium level modeling granularity while still affording fast execution. In some of our active projects in real-time data- driven simulations, we are developing one such hybrid method. Two novel aspects of our hybrid method are: (1) formulation of a field-based model of vehicular traffic movement in a large road network (2) fast execution of the field-based hybrid model on data-parallel platforms of general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs).","1087-4097","978-0-7695-3159-5","10.1109/PADS.2008.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545342","","Traffic control;Communication system traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Road vehicles;Aggregates;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Graphics;Magnetic fields;Prototypes","computer graphic equipment;digital simulation;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","GPU;field-based vehicular mobility model;vehicular traffic simulation;queuing effects;control mechanism;traffic interaction;traffic control;network size;road intersection;vehicular traffic load;modeling granularity;real-time data-driven simulation;vehicular traffic movement;road network;data parallel platform;graphics processing units","","4","","","","20 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For animation and interaction in virtual world the emphasis should be extended to general objects with human-like faces. We propose four parameter-based lip models that can apply the lip motion to general objects with lip-like meshes. We analyze the characteristics of lip motions and define four different lip models: inflexible-cylindrical model, flexible-cylindrical model, inflexible-square model, and flexible-square model. The parameters of lip motion in different lip models are extracted from the original real facial image sequence with lip motion. These parameters are then used to generate a lip-motion simulation system for general objects. Using the system, the user can apply the lip motion to any meshes by simply defining the lip model.","","0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035816","","Facial animation;Mouth;Humans;Face;Muscles;Skin;Computer science;Application software;Computational modeling;Image motion analysis","computer animation;image motion analysis;digital simulation;image sequences;parameter estimation","parameter-based lip modeling;general objects;human-computer interaction;virtual characters;human face simulation;lip motion analysis;inflexible-cylindrical model;lip-like meshes;flexible-cylindrical model;inflexible-square model;flexible-square model;facial image sequence;lip-motion simulation system;facial animation system","","","1","6","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system deals with a task of controlling contact states between bodies like the assembly task. When one body is not in contact with another, not only contact states but also other new states which can specify more general arrangement of the bodies are necessary in order to make the robot more skilful. The author introduced a virtual smallface (VSF) and an artificial constrained motion primitive (ACMP) for this purpose. A virtual polyhedron for constrained motion (VPCM) is newly introduced in order to implement more general ACMPs.

To obtain appropriate human aid for conducting tasks, a robot should be capable of generating meaningful questions regarding the task procedures in real time and applying the results to modify its task plans or behaviors. However, few studies on integrating robot task management and HRI in such high-level task planning exist. In this paper, we propose a new scheme of script-based task planning and HRI that supports the planning and is generated by it. The planning operates on a set of plain and easily writable task procedures, or scripts. The approach produces robust, practical, and easy-to-manipulate robot behavior. Based on the scripts, the system identifies plan ambiguities that require interaction with humans, and resolves them using the human response. The interaction thus generated is highly relevant and task-oriented. The robot learns from the interaction history to improve its subsequent planning in general, or personalize it. Two simulation cases, of a home service and a museum-guide robot, are presented to show how the robots lead appropriate interaction and smoothly adjust their task plans to user commands or responses. Such close integration of HRI and robot task planning is expected to advance the practicality of service robots.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2014.2298214","Nuclear Research and Development Program of the National Research Foundation grant funded by the Korean Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6718138","Human-robot interaction;script-based task planning;service robot;task-oriented interaction;Humanârobot interaction;script-based task planning;service robot;task-oriented interaction","Planning;Service robots;Collaboration;Concrete;Cognition;Abstracts","human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;mobile robots;service robots","task-oriented service robot interaction generation;human-robot interaction;robot capability enhancement;human-robot collaboration;robot task management;HRI;high-level task planning;script-based task planning;robot behavior;human response;robot learning;museum-guide robot;home service robot;user commands","","17","","68","","21 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computational models can provide a systematic method of investigating the attention distribution of humans. In this article, we reanalyze eye tracking data from anesthesiologists when inducing general anesthesia to test whether the so-called expectancy value version of the salience, effort, expectancy, value (SEEV) model can accommodate the visual attention distribution of anesthesiologists, and to investigate the effect of case (real versus simulated cases) and experience (junior versus senior) on the expectancy value model fit. The overall model fit is good (predicted-observed percentage dwell time correlation of 0.810, R2 = 0.656). We observe that the model fit is better in simulated cases than real ones. In addition, the model fit is good for junior anesthesiologists independent of the case, but that there is an even better model fit in simulated cases than in real ones for senior anesthesiologists (case Ã experience interaction). Overall, the expectancy value model can be validated. However, at least within the context of anesthesiology, the full SEEV model may be needed to capture the large and distractive visual work environment of anesthesiologists. From a practical point of view, previous research suggested that anesthesiologists pay more attention to monitoring in simulated cases. However, the SEEV analysis suggests that anesthesiologists do not pay extra attention to monitoring equipment in simulated cases, but may not be able to pay enough attention to monitoring equipment in real cases.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2020.2983817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9082594","Attention allocation;anesthesiology;salience;effort;expectancy;value (SEEV) model;simulation","Visualization;Task analysis;Data models;Monitoring;Anesthesia;Predictive models;Mathematical model","data visualisation;decision making;human computer interaction;statistical analysis;user interfaces","statistical modeling;senior anesthesiologists;visually rich working environments;computational models;general anesthesia;expectancy value version;visual attention distribution;simulated cases;expectancy value model fit;junior anesthesiologists;SEEV model;large work environment;distractive visual work environment;junior anesthesiologists","","","","35","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Only with the AR design strategy humans are able to behave as much as possible in a natural way: behavior of humans in the real world with other humans and/or real world objects.

Designed to attach to the endpoint of an impedance-type haptic interface like a SensAble Phantom, the Touch Thimble includes a slightly oversize cup that is suspended around the fingertip by passive springs. When the haptic interface applies contact forces from the virtual environment, the springs deflect to allow contact between the user's fingertip and the inner surface of the cup. We evaluated a prototype Touch Thimble against a standard thimble in a formal user study and found that it did not improve nor degrade subjects' ability to recognize smoothly curving surfaces.

Thanks to edge computing, DIA Service Providers (DSPs) can rent resources from Edge Infrastructure Providers (EIPs) to place service entities that store user states and run computation-intensive tasks. One fundamental problem for a DSP is to decide where to place service entities to achieve low-delay pairwise interactions between DIA users, under the constraint that the total placement cost is no more than a specified budget threshold. In this article, we formally model the service entity placement problem and prove that it is NP-complete by a polynomial reduction from the set cover problem. We present GPA, an efficient algorithm for service entity placement, and theoretically analyze its performance. We evaluated GPA with both real-world data trace-driven simulations, and observed that GPA performs close to the optimal algorithm and generally outperforms the baseline algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a general purpose pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation Web-based learning system called health information network teaching system (HINTS) to further facilitate students' learning and thereby make the HINTS a more helpful educational tool. Our focus is the design of the general purpose pedagogical architecture and its implementation in a multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. A preliminary students' performance evaluation result is also reported. We analyzed how to evaluate the students' performance and how the hints were given by the pedagogical agent.

This use is good enough for the realization of high quality simulators such as VETIR. All actions in simulators are generated by a precise set of rules which determine the correct feedback stimuli to be presented to the operator. In the article, haptic interfaces are presented as stand alone systems having their own and independent control. Consequently we explore the control capabilities and we identify a new extended interaction paradigm which provides to the machine the capability of interpreting the human actions and organizing a new high level feedback.

The maximum achievable gain in individual sections of helix type traveling wave amplifiers is limited by the requirement that the device be stable with respect to the excitation of backward waves, Generally, there is a critical length above which the backward wave is absolutely unstable. Whether this length is exceeded in a specific device depends on a number of details that must be computed numerically. We will present a model, based on the TWT simulation code CHRISTINE, in which BWO stability is determined including a number of important effects. These are: the placement of severs, their reflection and transmission coefficients, the profile of attenuation along the interaction length, the presence of a driven signal, and the coupling of forward and backward waves due to asymmetries in the helix support structure. Specifically our model calculates the gain for the coupled forward and backward waves in a specified frequency band. Asymmetries result in a stop band near the pi point formed by the coupling of the forward and backward waves. Here the beam interacts with a composite mode formed by the fundamental spatial harmonic of the forward wave and first spatial harmonic of the backward wave. These modes will have differing coupling coefficients with the beam which we calculate using an improved solution of the tape-helix dispersion equations.","0730-9244","0-7803-5224-6","10.1109/PLASMA.1999.829282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=829282","","Numerical simulation;Plasma waves;Plasma sources;Plasma density;Plasma devices;Laboratories;Couplings;Frequency;Particle beams;Educational institutions","backward wave tubes;digital simulation","numerical simulation;backward wave excitation;helix-travelling wave tubes;traveling wave amplifiers;critical length;absolutely unstable backward wave;CHRISTINE TWT simulation code;severs;reflection coefficients;transmission coefficients;attenuation profile;interaction length;driven signal;asymmetries;forward-backward wave coupling;coupled forward and backward waves;frequency band;stop band;pi point;fundamental spatial harmonic;coupling coefficients;tape-helix dispersion equations","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It generalizes and extends the concept of a virtual coupling network, an artificial link between the haptic display and a virtual world, to include both the impedance and admittance models of haptic interaction. A benchmark example exposes an important duality between these two cases. Linear circuit theory is used to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of a haptic simulation, assuming the human operator and virtual environment are passive. These equations lead to an explicit design procedure for virtual coupling networks which give maximum performance while guaranteeing stability. By decoupling the haptic display control problem from the design of virtual environments, the use of a virtual coupling network frees the developer of haptic-enabled virtual reality models from issues of mechanical stability.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.768179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=768179","","Haptic interfaces;Virtual environment;Coupling circuits;Displays;Circuit stability;Impedance;Admittance;Linear circuits;Sufficient conditions;Circuit simulation","virtual reality;force feedback;haptic interfaces;absolute stability;mechanical stability","haptic interface;virtual environments;absolute stability;virtual coupling network;impedance control;admittance models;linear circuit theory;haptic display;virtual reality;force feedback","","432","6","29","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our paper explores this idea and presents a thorough, full-factorial comparison of how all combinations of audio, visual and haptic interfaces affect performance during manipulation. We evaluated how each combination affects the performance in a study (N=25 ) consisting of manipulation tasks with various difficulties. The overall performance was assessed using both subjective measures, by assessing cognitive workload and system usability, and objective measurements, by incorporating time and spatial accuracy-based metrics. The results showed that regardless of task complexity, the combination of stereoscopic-vision with the virtual reality headset increased performance across all measurements by 40%, compared to monocular-vision from a generic display monitor. Besides, using haptic feedback improved outcomes by 10% and auditory feedback accounted for approximately 5% improvement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990080","EPSRC Future AI and Robotics for Space; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076603","Audiovisuohaptic;auditory feedback;haptic feedback;immersive manipulation;immersive teleoperation;multimodal interaction;multimodal interface;virtual reality","Task analysis;Visualization;Haptic interfaces;Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics;Virtual reality","computer displays;control engineering computing;haptic interfaces;manipulators;stereo image processing;telerobotics;virtual reality","multimodal interfaces;immersive solutions;human performance;auditory interaction;visual interaction;haptic interaction;simulated environment;extensive comparison;audiovisuohaptic interfaces;human perception;task performance;full-factorial comparison;audio interfaces;visual interfaces;haptic interfaces;manipulation tasks;subjective measures;cognitive workload;system usability;objective measurements;spatial accuracy-based metrics;task complexity;haptic feedback improved outcomes","","","","68","CCBY","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

THe AF was designed to be composable across HLA federations that use different object model abstractions in their federation object models (FOM). This composability is provided by a conceptual framework that includes fourth-generation development tools that automate the procedures required for a federate to subscribe, publish and interpret federation data. Many of these automated procedures could not be used when the AF was applied in support of the Joint Advanced Distributed Simulation (JADS) Joint Test Force (JTF). The JADS federation did not take the mainstream HLA implementation approach; instead, they developed and implemented federation-specific policies that were necessary to provide the interoperability support that exceeded the HLA baseline. The approach they took was to include objects and interactions in the JADS FOM that were named byte streams of specified sizes. The data structure definitions that were required to decode these byte streams were not documented in the FOM. In the absence of these automation procedures, the AF was manually composed application in the JADS federation. Analysis of the manual composability procedures that were used suggests that they could have been automated if the problem was looked at from a different level of abstraction. A discussion of the application of the AF in the JADS federation and a system design for automating the composability of a federate in federations whose FOMs use named data structures is presented.","","0-7803-5780-9","10.1109/WSC.1999.816828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816828","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Electronic equipment testing;Automation;Data structures;Computer networks;Electronic warfare;Data analysis;Data visualization","digital simulation;electronic warfare;military computing;software architecture;distributed programming;open systems;data structures;naming services;testing;data analysis;data visualisation","Analysis Federate;Joint Advanced Distributed Simulation;Joint Test Force Electronic Warfare Phase II test;High Level Architecture;data collection tool;data analysis tool;data visualization tool;federate composability automation;HLA federations;object model abstractions;federation object models;4th-generation development tools;JADS federation;federation-specific policies;interoperability support;named byte streams;undocumented data structure definitions;abstraction level;system design;named data structures","","","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience. Experiments based on using haptics technology in the field of education can also be easily performed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed coupling, a case study is presented.

In response to the arrival of the digital humanities era, this study aimed to develop a novel app that posts information on cultural events. With the assistance of the app and a geographic information system (GIS), the general public or students in senior high school or above can receive the latest information on arts and culture events around them and then actively participate in them as well as gather companions. With numerous apps coming out or being eliminated every day, research has found that smartphone users rarely read information in text form carefully but prefer information presented in a simple and visualized form. The inclusion of augmented reality (AR) interactions makes users more willing to use an app. We first conducted a questionnaire survey to understand user preferences with regard to layout and interface operations. Based on the results, we developed prototypes for the IOS/Android OS environments and incorporated open data for synchronized updates on cultural events.

Furthermore, the app can serve as a future source of big data for the analysis of information such as user preferences with regard to cultural events and travel route planning.

However, when confronted to non-stationary environments, these methods crucially rely on an exploration-exploitation trade-off which is rarely dynamically and automatically adjusted to changes in the environment. Here we propose an active exploration algorithm for RL in structured (parameterized) continuous action space. This framework deals with a set of discrete actions, each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. Discrete exploration is controlled through a Boltzmann softmax function with an inverse temperature Î² parameter. In parallel, a Gaussian exploration is applied to the continuous action parameters. We apply a meta-learning algorithm based on the comparison between variations of short-term and long-term reward running averages to simultaneously tune Î² and the width of the Gaussian distribution from which continuous action parameters are drawn. We first show that this algorithm reaches state-of-the-art performance in the non-stationary multi-armed bandit paradigm, while also being generalizable to continuous actions and multi-step tasks. We then apply it to a simulated human-robot interaction task, and show that it outperforms continuous parameterized RL both without active exploration and with active exploration based on uncertainty variations measured by a Kalman-Q-learning algorithm.","","978-1-5090-6724-4","10.1109/IRC.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7926511","reinforcement learning;meta-learning;active exploration;multi-arm bandit;human-robot interaction","Robots;Learning (artificial intelligence);Human-robot interaction;Upper bound;Electronic mail;Gaussian distribution;Uncertainty","Gaussian distribution;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence)","parameterized reinforcement learning;human-robot interaction task;active exploration algorithm;RL;Boltzmann softmax function;inverse temperature parameter;Gaussian exploration;continuous action parameters;meta-learning algorithm;Gaussian distribution;nonstationary multiarmed bandit paradigm;Kalman-Q-learning algorithm","","5","","21","","15 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have found also that when users perceive that the task is very difficult but the system is providing some help by means of a virtual fixture, they tend to spend more time trying to achieve a successful task execution. Thus, for difficult tasks the benefits of virtual fixturing are better reflected in a reduction of the error rate than in a decreased execution time.

Technological progress in fields, such as artificial intelligence, computer science, speech simulation, image processing, and remote controls, has led to advances in robotic technology [1]. Interaction between human and robot can be separated into two general categories: remote, where the human and the robot are separated in space or time, and proximate, where the human and the robot may be found in the same location [2]. These two general categories can be further distinguished between applications that require mobility, physical manipulation, or social interaction. Social interactions with robots are more proximate rather than remote. The purpose of this paper is to design the architecture of a robotic system and understand how it might assist people with disabilities and help them stay independent longer. Future work includes verification and validation of the architecture and robotic construction. An experimentation plan will take place in order to evaluate the behavior and performance of the robotic system.

Inspired by the observation that humans continually adapt their behavior when interacting under varying social context, we propose Adaptive EXP4 (A-EXP4), a novel online learning algorithm for adapting the robot-pedestrian interaction policy. To address limitations of bandit algorithms in adaptation to unseen and highly dynamic scenarios, we employ a mixture model over the policy parameter space. Specifically, a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPMM) is used to cluster the parameters of sampled policies and maintain a mixture model over the clusters, hence effectively discovering policies that are suitable to the current environmental context in an unsupervised manner. Our simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility of A-EXP4 in accommodating interaction with different types of pedestrians while jointly minimizing social disruption through the adaptation process. While the A-EXP4 formulation is kept general for application in a variety of domains requiring continual adaptation of a robot's policy, we specifically evaluate the performance of our algorithm using a suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform. In this concrete assistive scenario, the algorithm observes how audio signals produced by the navigational system affect the behavior of pedestrians and adapts accordingly. Consequently, we find A-EXP4 to effectively adapt the interaction policy for gently clearing a navigation path in crowded settings, resulting in significant reduction in empirical regret compared to the EXP4 baseline.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967737","","","audio signal processing;control engineering computing;Gaussian processes;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;mobile robots;pedestrians","online social policy learning;Adaptive robot-pedestrian interaction;self-supervised adaptation;social interaction;active communication;audio signals;visual signals;social context;Adaptive EXP4;online learning algorithm;robot-pedestrian interaction policy;bandit algorithms;unseen scenarios;highly dynamic scenarios;policy parameter space;Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model;sampled policies;current environmental context;social disruption;adaptation process;continual adaptation;suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform;EXP4 baseline;navigation path;crowded settings","","","","45","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The apprenticeship model augments self-supervised learning with learning by demonstration, efficiently using the human's time and expertise while facilitating future scalability to supervision of multiple robots; the human provides demonstrations via virtual reality when the robot cannot complete the task autonomously. Experimental results indicate that the robot learns a grasping task with the apprenticeship model faster than with a solely self-supervised approach and with fewer human interventions than a solely demonstration-based approach; 100% grasping success is obtained after 150 grasps with 19 demonstrations. Preliminary user studies evaluating workload, usability, and effectiveness of the system yield promising results for system scalability and deployability.

For this target group a new method of data input has been developed and evaluated, which allows the patient or generally the affected user to input data with a wiping technique on a touch screen. Variations caused by the tremor are compensated with a continuous movement rather than a single direct movement towards a target area. Additionally, the screen surface causes a significant friction and helps to reduce the effects of the tremor.

For the teleoperation of a mobile robotic platform, a simple application of this general principle could be to commit the human operator in performing the necessary global planning operations, which are more demanding in terms of complex reasoning and required ""intelligence"", while other more local tasks such as collision avoidance and trajectory optimization are dedicated to the telerobotic system.

While rotational information has been shown to be important, the benefit of the translational component is still unclear with mixed results in previous work. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-method experiment to compare four levels of translational cues and control: none (using the trackpad of the HTC Vive controller to translate), upper-body leaning (sitting on a âNaviChairâ, leaning the upper-body to locomote), whole-body leaning/stepping (standing on a platform called NaviBoard, leaning the whole body or stepping one foot off the center to navigate), and full translation (physically walking). Results showed that translational cues and control had significant effects on various measures including task performance, task load, and simulator sickness. While participants performed significantly worse when they used a controller with no embodied translational cues, there was no significant difference between the NaviChair, NaviBoard, and actual walking. These results suggest that translational body-based motion cues and control from a low-cost leaning/stepping interface might provide enough sensory information for supporting spatial updating, spatial awareness, and efficient locomotion in VR, although future work will need to investigate how these results might or might not generalize to other tasks and scenarios.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2935730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809840","Adaptive control;cognitive informatics;human computer interaction;human factors;user interface;virtual reality","Legged locomotion;Task analysis;Navigation;Resists;Wheelchairs;Virtual reality;Input devices","virtual reality","physical translation;rotational information;translational component;mixed-method experiment;HTC Vive controller;NaviChair;NaviBoard;task performance;embodied translational cues;walking;translational body-based motion cues;virtual locomotion;gold standard;navigation;virtual reality;upper-body leaning;whole-body leaning;whole-body stepping;task load;simulator sickness;low-cost leaning interface;low-cost stepping interface;sensory information;spatial updating;spatial awareness","","","","50","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in this paper, we adopt an unprecedented approach by designing a custom musical cyber world to serve as a virtual laboratory for the ethnographic study of music. By constructing an immersive cyber world suitable for ethno musicological fieldwork, we aim for much greater control than has heretofore been possible in ethno musicological research, leading to results that may suggest better ways of designing musical cyber worlds for research, discovery, learning, entertainment, and e-commerce, as well as contributing towards our general understanding of the role of music in human interaction and community-formation. Such controlled research can usefully supplement traditional ethnography in the real world.","","978-1-4577-1453-5","10.1109/CW.2011.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079353","Ethnomusicology;ethnography;fieldwork;cyberworlds;world music;collaborative virtual environment;groupware;Wonderland;spatial music;immersive environment;hypermedia","Avatars;Servers;Computer architecture;Three dimensional displays;Microprocessors;Virtual environments;Collaboration","cultural aspects;design of experiments;groupware;music;virtual reality","cyberworld laboratory;ethnomusicology;musical cyber world;collaborative virtual environment;immersive virtual environment;musical database browsing;experimental design;socio-cultural environment;ethnographic study;entertainment;e-commerce;human interaction;community-formation","","1","","17","","17 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These procedures involve the use of flexible tipped guidewires to advance diagnostic or therapeutic catheters into a patient's vascular or visceral anatomy. This paper presents a real-time physically based hybrid modeling approach to simulating guidewire insertions. The long, slender body of the guidewire shaft is simulated using nonlinear elastic Cosserat rods, and the shorter flexible tip composed of a straight, curved, or angled design is modeled using a more efficient generalized bending model. Therefore, the proposed approach efficiently computes intrinsic dynamic behaviors of guidewire interactions within vascular structures. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated using detailed numerical simulations inside 3-D blood vessel structures derived from preprocedural volumetric data. A validation study compares positions of four physical guidewires deployed within a vascular phantom, with the co-ordinates of the corresponding simulated guidewires within a virtual model of the phantom. An optimization algorithm is also implemented to further improve the accuracy of the simulation. The presented simulation model is suitable for interactive virtual reality-based training and for treatment planning.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2199319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200309","Cosserat theory of elastic rod;guidewire insertion;minimally invasive interventions;physically based simulation","Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Materials;Friction;Shafts;Accuracy;Real time systems","catheters;phantoms;radiology;surgery;virtual reality","stable nonlinear elastic approach;real time nonlinear elastic approach;guidewire simulation;catheter insertion simulation;Cosserat rod;interventional radiology;angioplasty;embolization;stent graft placement;minimally invasive therapy;vascular anatomy;visceral anatomy;vascular phantom;interactive virtual reality based training;treatment planning","Algorithms;Aorta, Abdominal;Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal;Catheterization;Catheterization;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Cardiovascular;Nonlinear Dynamics;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results","51","","26","","15 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are some features of the material object model that cannot be perceived by the observer through his/her senses (i.e. magnetization, radiation, humidity). Exploration of such features requires additional means and techniques that expand the perception range of the observer's different sensory channels. Traditional approaches use only a few of the explicit properties of objects models (mainly its geometric, structural and topological characteristics) for their building. We believe that the supplement of implicit properties, the selection of an appropriate combination of stimuli for separate sensory channels, their effective presentation to the observer and the ability for their modification directly in the virtual world will turn this situation in a way that may lead to a disruption in the generally accepted practices for different research fields, thus allowing for the virtual reality to unfold its full potential as a significant engineering design tool. Respectively, this will considerably enhance and intensify the information perception of the observer during object exploration in the virtual environment. Here, a brief introduction in the Virtual Reality and its engineering application is presented. The concepts about the material objects and their properties, as well as systems and norms for standardized properties sets and classes, have been surveyed. The developed Aura-Dowsing interaction technique as a part of ongoing complex research on the possibility for implementation of the implicit properties concept is presented and discussed.","","978-1-4577-2186-1","10.1109/DeSE.2011.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150058","implicit properties;material objects;virtual reality;multisensorial presentation","Materials;Virtual environments;Solid modeling;Visualization;Observers;Color","computer graphics;image representation;virtual reality","object representation;virtual reality environment;material object model;sensory channel;virtual world;engineering design tool;information perception;object exploration;standardized properties sets;Aura-Dowsing interaction technique","","2","3","8","","13 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas lots of AR-based self-learning support systems have been developed in previous studies, it has not been sufficiently evaluated how it influences a learner's mindset and the efficiency of training. In this paper, we investigate the user experience brought by AR technologies in a self-learning process. We chose the game of Go as a study program, and developed the Augmented Reality Go (ARGo) system to compare the AR and conventional PC-based learning assistance. We found that the physical interaction with the original game apparatus enhanced the subjects' intrinsic motivation towards self-learning.

Towards studying communication skill in such a setting, we collected 72 dyadic interactions of participants discussing on general topics. Manual rating of these interaction videos have been obtained from two external observers. Multimodal features related to non-verbal behavior: prosody, speaking activity, visual and verbal behavior are automatically extracted. The experimental results show that the multimodal fusion of features with reliefF feature ranking perform best with an accuracy of 74%. Also, we automatically rate the overall discussion by extracting features from both participants. Our best results on automatic discussion rating achieves an accuracy of 83%.

We present a simulation of engineered bone tissue growth using the Repast HPC toolkit, an ABM tool for high-performance computing environments. We use this example to provide preliminary performance tests on new features (not yet publicly released) of Repast HPC that accommodate operations common to biological modeling: 3-Dimensional parallelized spatial simulation and diffusion in 3 dimensions. Repast HPC is a general ABM toolkit, and the performance documented here should be representative of performance on other simulations.

Locomotion interfaces induce some biases both in the perception of the self-motion or in the formation of virtual locomotion trajectories. These biases have been mostly evaluated in the context of static environments, and studies need to be revisited in the new context of populated environments where users interact with virtual characters. We focus on a situation of collision avoidance between a real participant and a virtual character, and compared it to previous studies on real walkers. Our results show that, as in reality, the risk of future collision is accurately anticipated by participants, however with delay. We also show that collision avoidance trajectories formed in VR have common properties with real ones, with some quantitative differences in avoidance distances. More generally, our evaluation demonstrates that reliable results can be obtained for qualitative analysis of small scale interactions in VR. We discuss these results in the perspective of a VR platform for large scale interaction applications, such as in a crowd, for which real data are difficult to gather.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2714665","French National Research Agency ANR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7946183","Locomotion;interaction;evaluation;experiment;collision avoidance;virtual reality","Trajectory;Legged locomotion;Collision avoidance;Context;Measurement;Virtual environments","collision avoidance;navigation;virtual reality","populated environments;virtual character;collision avoidance;virtual people;locomotion interfaces;dynamic environments;virtual environments;Virtual Reality system;virtual locomotion trajectories;static environments;VR platform","","13","","51","","12 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We envision future work and play environments that are more effectively human-centered with the user's computing interface being more closely integrated with the physical surroundings than today's conventional computer display screens and keyboards. We are working toward realizable versions of such environments, in which multiple video projectors and digital cameras enable every visible surface to be both measured in 3D and used for display. If the 3D surface positions are transmitted to a distant location, they may also enable distant collaborations to become more like working in adjacent offices connected by large windows. In one prototype, depth maps are calculated from streams of video images and the resulting 3D surface points are displayed to the user in head-tracked stereo. Another prototype allows direct ""painting"" onto movable objects - a dollhouse, for example. One long-term goal is advanced training for trauma surgeons by immersive replay of recorded procedures. More generally, we hope to demonstrate that the principal interface of a future computing environment need not be limited to a screen the size of one or two sheets of paper. Just as a useful physical environment is all around us, so too can the increasingly ubiquitous computing environment be all around us - becoming more effectively human-centered and integrated into our physical surroundings.","1943-6106","0-7695-2443-5","10.1109/VLHCC.2005.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509481","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Prototypes;Physics computing;Keyboards;Digital cameras;Three dimensional displays;Large screen displays;Collaborative work;Streaming media","visual programming;solid modelling;virtual reality;human computer interaction;user centred design;user interfaces","immersive integration;virtual environments;human-centered environments;user interface;multiple video projectors;digital cameras;3D surface position;windows;video images;3D surface points;movable objects;ubiquitous computing","","","","","","17 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications in the context of interactive audio-visual animation on low-cost general-purpose computers are demonstrated, and an approach to joint audio-visual synthesis is proposed that provides fine-scale synchronization and high coherence between the two modalities.

This article finalizes recent advances in manual control theory toward more general pursuit and preview tracking tasks. It is quantified how HCs adapt their control behavior to a final crucial task variable: the target trajectory bandwidth. Beneficial adaptation strategies are first explored offline with computer simulations, using an extended crossover model theory for pursuit and preview tracking. The predictions are then verified with data from a human-in-the-loop experiment, in which participants tracked a target trajectory with bandwidths of 1.5, 2.5, and 4 rad/s, using compensatory, as well as pursuit and preview displays. In stark contrast to the crossover regression found in compensatory tasks, humans attenuate only their feedforward response when tracking higher-bandwidth trajectories in pursuit tasks, while their behavior is generally invariant in preview tasks. A full quantitative theory is now available to predict HC manual control behavior in tracking tasks, which includes HC adaptation to all key task variables.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2019.2947577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897675","Manual control;modeling;pursuit;preview;target trajectory bandwidth","Task analysis;Target tracking;Bandwidth;Trajectory;Adaptation models;Human factors;Predictive models","computer simulation;control engineering computing;feedback;feedforward;human factors;human-robot interaction;tracking","target trajectory bandwidth;preview tracking;human controller;compensatory tracking behavior;manual control theory;extended crossover model theory;human-in-the-loop experiment;crossover regression;compensatory tasks;tracking higher-bandwidth trajectories;HC manual control behavior;HC adaptation;pursuit tracking;computer simulations","","","","28","IEEE","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such architectures comprise two or more processors (often a mix of general purpose and digital signal processors) together with a rich peripheral mix to provide a high performance computational platform. While there are many simulation solutions in the industry available to address the system partitioning issues and also the verification of HW-SW interactions in these complex systems, there are very few solutions targetted towards the SW application developers' needs. The primary concern of the SW application developers is to debug and optimize their code. Hence, cycle accuracy and performance of the simulation solution becomes the key enablers. Desired observability and controllability of the models are additional careabouts. Secondly, application developers are more comfortable at instruction level simulations than they are with RTL or gate level simulation. These specific requirements have a bearing on the choices in the simulation solutions. This paper describes the design of a generic, C based multi-processor instruction set simulator framework in the context of the above parameters. This framework, termed the ""simulation bridge"", facilitates highly accurate, yet efficient simulation. The SimBridge performs clock correct lock-step simulation of the models in the architecture using a global simulation engine that handles both intra-processor and inter-processor communication in a homogenous fashion. It addresses the multiple key issues of execution control, synchronization, connectivity and communication. The paper concludes with the performance analysis of the SimBridge in an experimental test setup as well as in the Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320C54x-based simulators.","","1-58113-542-4","10.1145/774789.774800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003600","","Bridges;Computational modeling;Embedded computing;Computer architecture;Digital signal processors;Computer peripherals;High performance computing;Observability;Controllability;Context modeling","multiprocessing systems;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;performance evaluation;digital simulation;program debugging","Simulation Bridge;multi-processor simulation framework;embedded systems;system partitioning;HW-SW interactions verification;software debug;observability;controllability;instruction level simulations;gate level simulation;C based multi-processor instruction set simulator framework;SimBridge;performance analysis;TMS320C54x-based simulators","","6","2","12","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most serious cognitive dysfunctions among the elderly include mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VAD). Cognitive training is an effective approach to mitigate the decline in cognitive function. Recent studies have confirmed that emerging training methods using new technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and mobile phones, can be used effectively for cognitive training. This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare the brain activation of young and elderly people during VR and mobile phone training when performing a cognitive training game. fNIRS has been shown to be an effective tool for monitoring cognitive decline. In the current study, the MMSE scale was used to measure cognitive performance and fNIRS was used to measure brain activation among 20 youth (mean age 25.33Â± 1.59 years) and 17 elderly people (mean age 63Â± 4.35 years). The results showed that the mobile phone game produced significant activation of the prefrontal lobe (PFC) and the VR game produced significant activation of the parietal lobe (MC). The average MMSE scale score of the elderly group was lower than that of the young group and was strongly correlated with PFC activation. This study confirms that elderly people have reduced cognitive function compared to young people. The results indicate that mobile phone games have a positive training effect on reducing cognitive decline, and that VR is a suitable means for cognitive function training among the elderly.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3050210","Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Shandong Social Science Planning Fund Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317849","Virtual reality;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;cortical activation;game experience;cognitive decline","Games;Training;Senior citizens;Mobile handsets;Spectroscopy;Land mobile radio;Task analysis","biomedical optical imaging;brain;cognition;computer games;diseases;geriatrics;infrared spectroscopy;neurophysiology;virtual reality","game interaction modes;cortical activation;cognitive function decline;mild cognitive impairment;mobile phones;near-infrared spectroscopy;fNIRS;brain activation;mobile phone training;cognitive training game;cognitive decline;cognitive performance;mobile phone game;VR game;PFC activation;cognitive function training","","","","50","CCBY","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent development of diffusion tensor MRI has shown its feasibility in grading tumor, monitoring therapeutic effects, and post-surgery outcome. To visualize the tumor mass and the peritumoral structure, a 3D virtual reality environment was developed. Neural tractography and peritumoral anatomy were integrated in this interaction VR system. Using a 3D controller, suitable surgical trajectory can be defined by manipulating the tumor mass, peritumoral microstructure, and brain tissues before neurosurgery. Post-surgery evaluation showed that this system was useful to design pre-surgerical plan and optimize therapeutic outcome.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352542","","Virtual reality;Neurosurgery;Neoplasms;Surgery;Trajectory;Tensile stress;Magnetic resonance imaging;Visualization;Anatomy;Weight control","biodiffusion;biomedical MRI;brain;cancer;neurophysiology;surgery;tumours;virtual reality","DTI-based virtual reality system;neurosurgery;brain tumor mass;peritumoral structures;peritumoral edema;surgical trajectory planning;tumor excision;postsurgery evaluation;diffusion tensor MRI;therapeutic effects monitoring;3D virtual reality environment;neural tractography;peritumoral anatomy;3D controller;brain tissue microstructure;presurgerical plan design","Computer Graphics;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Neurosurgical Procedures;Neurosurgical Procedures;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","2","","10","","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards a Proximal resource-based architecture to support augmented reality applications","C. Taylor; J. Pasquale","Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA","2010 Cloud-Mobile Convergence for Virtual Reality Workshop (CMCVR 2010) Proceedings","2 Sep 2010","2010","","","5","9","We are developing a new enhanced cloud-based computing architecture, called the Proximal Workspace architecture to allow access and interaction between lightweight devices, e.g., video glasses, earphones, wrist displays, body sensors, etc., and applications that represent a new generation of computationand-data-intensive programs in areas such as augmented reality. While lightweight devices offer an easy way for these applications to collect user data and offer feedback, the applications cannot be run natively and completely on these devices because of high resource demands. Making these applications available via a cloud, while promoting ubiquitous access and providing the necessary resources to execute the applications, induces large delays due to network latency. To solve these problems, we are developing a new system architecture based on supporting workspaces which provide nearby computing power to the users devices and thus mediate between them and the clouds computing resources. Specifically, a workspace provides a set of middleware utilities designed to exploit local resources, and provide specific functions such as rendering of graphics, pre-fetching of data, and combining data from different servers. More generally, the workspace is designed to run any subset of activities that cannot be run on a user's device due to computation speed or storage size, and cannot be run on a cloud server due to network latency. Ultimately, the goal is to produce a set of middleware utilities that when run in the workspace with highly-interactive, computation/data intensive applications will result in better user-perceived performance. We are exploring this system architecture constructively, by adapting applications that benefit from this architecture and discovering how best to suit their needs. We have already adapted VNC (Virtual Network Computing, which allows local interaction with remote computations) to run under a similar architecture, and as a result increased video performance in high network latency conditions by an order of magnitude. We are currently working on adapting Google Earth to run under this system architecture, with the goal of the user being able to intuitively navigate through renderings of Ancient Rome in video glasses, without being hampered by any bulky equipment.","2160-2891","978-1-4244-5861-5","10.1109/CMCVR.2010.5560606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560606","","Servers;Computer architecture;Google;Earth;Rendering (computer graphics);Three dimensional displays;Games","augmented reality;Internet;middleware;software architecture;ubiquitous computing","resource-based architecture;augmented reality applications;cloud-based computing architecture;proximal workspace architecture;lightweight devices;video glasses;earphones;wrist displays;body sensors;computation and-data-intensive programs;ubiquitous access;middleware utilities;VNC;virtual network computing;Google Earth","","7","","19","","2 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve consistent performance during impedance control tasks, an a-priori knowledge of the environment parameters is needed to adjust the controller's impedance parameters accordingly. Concentrating on tasks requiring constant impedance parameters throughout operation, a model-free learning framework is proposed to autonomously find the suitable parameters values. The framework relies on Bayesian optimization and episodic reward calculation requiring the drone to repeatedly perform a predetermined task in the environment actively searching in the impedance parameters space. The sample-efficiency and safety of learning were improved by adding two novel modifications to standard Bayesian optimization. The proposed technique was validated in a high fidelity simulation environment. The results show that the proposed framework is able to automatically find suitable impedance parameters values in different situations given the same initial knowledge and that the learned parameters values can be generalized to similar interaction tasks.","2475-8426","978-1-7281-0778-3","10.1109/SSRR.2019.8848967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8848967","","Impedance;Task analysis;Bayes methods;Optimization;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Robot sensing systems","aerospace robotics;Bayes methods;control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;optimisation","aerial ground robots;model-free learning framework;Bayesian-optimized impedance control;safe physical interaction;interaction-control technique","","","","15","","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, still a more general solution that considers the heterogeneity of the involved actors/items is lacking. In this paper, we present MIME, a mixed-space tri-collaborative system. Differently from other mixed-space systems, MIME considers three different types of users (in different locations) according to the level of immersion in the system, who can interact simultaneously - what we call a tri-collaboration. For the three types, we provide a solution to navigate, point at objects/locations and make annotations, while users are able to see a virtual representation of the rest of users. Additionally, the total number of users that can simultaneously interact with the system is only restricted by the available hardware, i.e., various users of the same type can be simultaneously connected to the system. We have conducted a preliminary study at the laboratory level, showing that MIME is a promising tool that can be used in many real cases for different purposes.","","978-1-5386-7592-2","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2018.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8699172","Augmented Reality;Virtual Reality;shared spaces;mixed-space;remote collaboration;K.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems]: Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities","Augmented reality","groupware;virtual reality","virtual representation;mixed-space tri-collaborative system;interaction capabilities;immersion systems;remote collaboration;MIME","","3","","15","","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, frequent switches among simulation contexts, excessive buffer accesses and tightly coupled manner often make such an architecture simulator slow, difficult to parallelize and hard to scale to large-scale many-core systems. In this paper, we propose Prophet, a parallel instruction-oriented simulation framework for many-cores. Prophet adopts a general instruction-oriented model to simulate processor cores, in which a simulator is built from the perspective of each simulated instruction impacting a small number of relevant processor components, as opposed to that of a large number of processor components executing many instructions in each cycle as in the cycle-oriented approach. Prophet determines the execution cycle of a simulated instruction based on the states of the relevant components impacted by the instruction, and update the components states after the execution of the instruction. Prophet also adopts a speculative model to decouple private resources from the shared resources (e.g., shared cache), which avoids unnecessary interactions between them and only pays a penalty upon a rare mis-speculation. We have designed and implemented a prototype of Prophet that supports both user-level and full-system simulation. Experimental results show Prophet can scale up to simulate thousands of simulated cores (4,096 cores in the current implementation) with good performance and small accuracy loss. It achieves average simulation speeds of about 98 and 235 MIPS (millions of simulated instructions per second) for full-system and user-level simulation, respectively, with only 3 percent IPC error rate and negligible deviation in cache simulation results. When run on a many-core platform (i.e., Intel Xeon Phi), it achieved an average simulation speed of about 413 MIPS.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2700307","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917344","Instruction-oriented;parallel;manycore;simulation;architecture-simulation","Computational modeling;Timing;Data models;Pipelines;Registers;Clocks","digital simulation;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing","Prophet;many-core simulator;large-scale many-core systems;parallel instruction-oriented simulation;general instruction-oriented model","","2","","31","Traditional","2 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cold-Test and Large-Signal Simulator (CTLSS), which has been developed as part of an SBD tool suite for vacuum electron devices. Computational electromagnetic codes are essential for applying the SBD methodology to the design of vacuum electron devices and components. CTLSS offers the unique advantage that its computational electromagnetics model is linked intimately with a large-signal simulation tool for computing the electron-wave interaction in the radiating structure. Currently, this link has been implemented for helix traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) only, using the CHRISTINE code as the large-signal model, but a new, general, large-signal model is under development and is described in this paper. The electromagnetic simulation engine in CTLSS has been designed and implemented as a volumetric frequency-domain model that can handle both resonant eigenvalue problems, using the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm, and nonresonant driven-frequency problems, using the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) technique to invert the non-Hermitian matrices that often occur in real problems. The features and advantages of this code relative to other models and results from the code for several classes of microwave devices are presented.","1939-9375","","10.1109/27.887737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887737","","Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Electron devices;Computational electromagnetics;Electromagnetic modeling;Jacobian matrices;Material properties;Geometry;Boundary conditions;Design methodology","simulation;digital simulation;design aids;microwave devices;vacuum tubes","3-D electromagnetic simulation tool;high-power microwave sources;simulation-based-design techniques;first-pass design success;material properties;three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation tool;cold-test and large-signal simulator;tool suite;electromagnetic codes;vacuum electron devices;electronic device components;computational electromagnetics model;large-signal simulation tool;electron-wave interaction;radiating structure;helix traveling-wave tubes;CHRISTINE code;large-signal model;electromagnetic simulation engine;volumetric frequency-domain model;resonant eigenvalue problems;Jacobi-Davidson algorithm;nonresonant driven-frequency problems;quasi-minimal residual technique;nonHermitian matrices;matrix inversion;microwave devices","","35","1","47","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The information contained in these images have become of great interest to the machine learning community, with applications spanning a wide portfolio of research areas, including bioengineering. In this work, we seek to demonstrate a high-fidelity simulation of holographic recording. By accurately and numerically simulating the propagation of a coherent light source through a series of optical elements and the object itself, we accurately predict the optical interference of the object and reference wave at the recording plane, including diffraction effects, aberrations, and speckle. We show that the optical transformation that predicts the complex field at the recording plane can be generalized for arbitrary holographic recording configurations using a matrix method. In addition, we provide a detailed description of digital phase reconstruction and aberration compensation for a variety of off-axis holographic configurations. Reconstruction errors are presented for the various holographic recording geometries and complex field objects. While the primary objective of this work is not to evaluate phase reconstruction approaches, the reconstruction of simulated holograms provides validation of the generalized simulation method. The long-term goal of this work is that the generalized holographic simulation motivates the use of phase reconstruction of the simulated holograms to populate databases for training machine-learning algorithms aimed at classifying relevant objects recorded through a variety of holographic setups. © 2020 Optical Society of America",,"Classification (of information); Holograms; Learning algorithms; Light sources; Linear transformations; Machine learning; Aberration compensation; Diffraction effects; High-fidelity simulations; Holographic recordings; Machine learning communities; Optical transformations; Phase reconstruction; Reconstruction error; Aberrations; algorithm; article; compensation; diffraction; geometry; high-fidelity simulation; machine learning; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094326708

As in human imaging, the primary barrier to quantitative imaging with HP gases is nonequilibrium magnetization, which is depleted by T1 relaxation and radio frequency excitation. Preclinical HP gas imaging commonly involves mechanically ventilating small animals and encoding k-space over tens or hundreds of breaths, with small subsets of k-space data collected within each breath. Breath-to-breath magnetization renewal enables the use of large flip angles, but the resulting magnetization decay generates large view-to-view differences in within-breath signal intensity, leading to artifacts and degraded image quality. This deleterious signal decay has motivated the use of variable flip angle (VFA) sampling schemes, in which the flip angle is progressively increased to maintain constant view-to-view signal intensity. However, VFA imaging complicates data acquisition and provides only a global correction that fails to compensate for regional differences in signal dynamics. When constant flip angle (CFA) imaging is used alongside 3D radial golden means acquisition, the center of k-space is sampled with every excitation, thereby encoding signal dynamics alongside imaging data. Here, keyhole reconstruction is used to generate multiple images to capture in-breath HP 129Xe signal dynamics in mice and thus provide flip angle maps to quantitatively correct images without extra data collection. These CFA images display SNR that is not significantly different from VFA images, and further, high frequency k-space scaling can be used to mitigate decay-induced image artifacts. Results are supported by point spread function calculations and simulations of radial imaging with preclinical signal dynamics. Together, these results show that CFA 3D radial golden means ventilation imaging provides comparable image quality with VFA in small animals and allows for keyhole reconstruction, which can be used to generate flip angle maps and correct images for signal depletion. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","129Xe; constant flip angle; hyperpolarized; mouse; MRI; preclinical; radial; variable flip angle","Data acquisition; Dynamics; Encoding (symbols); Image quality; Magnetization; Mammals; Optical transfer function; Signal encoding; Signal to noise ratio; Global corrections; High frequency HF; Magnetization decay; Non-equilibrium magnetization; Quantitative imaging; Radio frequency excitation; Regional differences; Signal intensities; Image reconstruction; animal experiment; article; artificial ventilation; calculation; controlled study; excitation; gas; human; image artifact; image quality; leisure; lung structure; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; point spread function; preclinical study; radiofrequency; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097930989

The goal of this study was to evaluate the accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency of a 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic fingerprinting (31P-MRSF) method for fast quantification of the forward rate constant of creatine kinase (CK) in mouse hindlimb. The 31P-MRSF method acquired spectroscopic fingerprints using interleaved acquisition of phosphocreatine (PCr) and γATP with ramped flip angles and a saturation scheme sensitive to chemical exchange between PCr and γATP. Parameter estimation was performed by matching the acquired fingerprints to a dictionary of simulated fingerprints generated from the Bloch-McConnell model. The accuracy of 31P-MRSF measurements was compared with the magnetization transfer (MT-MRS) method in mouse hindlimb at 9.4 T (n = 8). The reproducibility of 31P-MRSF was also assessed by repeated measurements. Estimation of the CK rate constant using 31P-MRSF (0.39 ± 0.03 s−1) showed a strong agreement with that using MT-MRS measurements (0.40 ± 0.05 s−1). Variations less than 10% were achieved with 2 min acquisition of 31P-MRSF data. Application of the 31P-MRSF method to mice subjected to an electrical stimulation protocol detected an increase in CK rate constant in response to stimulation-induced muscle contraction. These results demonstrated the potential of the 31P-MRSF framework for rapid, accurate, and reproducible quantification of the chemical exchange rate of CK in vivo. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","31P spectroscopy; creatine kinase activity; magnetic resonance fingerprinting; magnetization transfer","Enzymes; Magnetic resonance; Mammals; Muscle; Phosphorus; Rate constants; Chemical exchange; Electrical stimulations; Forward rate constants; Magnetization transfer; Muscle contractions; Repeated measurements; Reproducibilities; Spectroscopic fingerprints; Chromium compounds; adenosine triphosphate; creatine kinase; creatine phosphate; accuracy; Article; controlled study; electrostimulation; enzyme mechanism; hindlimb; male; mouse; nonhuman; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; rate constant; reproducibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093923357

Intrinsic dynamics are often plastic during development and learning, but the effects of these changes on stimulus encoding properties are not well known. To examine this relationship, we simulated auditory responses to zebra finch song using a linear-dynamical cascade model, which combines a linear spectrotemporal receptive field with a dynamical, conductance-based neuron model, then used generalized linear models to estimate encoding properties from the resulting spike trains. We focused on the effects of a low-threshold potassium current (KLT) that is present in a subset of cells in the zebra finch caudal mesopallium and is affected by early auditory experience. We found that KLT affects both spike adaptation and the temporal filtering properties of the receptive field. The direction of the effects depended on the temporal modulation tuning of the linear (input) stage of the cascade model, indicating a strongly nonlinear relationship. These results suggest that small changes in intrinsic dynamics in tandem with differences in synaptic connectivity can have dramatic effects on the tuning of auditory neurons.

Mathematical models informed by spatially and temporally distributed neuroimage data are becoming instrumental for reconstructing a coherent picture of normal and pathological oxygen delivery throughout the brain. Unfortunately, current mathematical models of cerebral blood flow and oxygen exchange become excessively large in size. They further suffer from boundary effects due to incomplete or physiologically inaccurate computational domains, numerical instabilities due to enormous length scale differences, and convergence problems associated with condition number deterioration at fine mesh resolutions. Our proposed simple finite volume discretization scheme for blood and oxygen microperfusion simulations does not require expensive mesh generation leading to the critical benefit that it drastically reduces matrix size and bandwidth of the coupled oxygen transfer problem. The compact problem formulation yields rapid and stable convergence. Moreover, boundary effects can effectively be suppressed by generating very large replica of the cortical microcirculation in silico using an image-based cerebrovascular network synthesis algorithm, so that boundaries of the perfusion simulations are far removed from the regions of interest. Massive simulations over sizeable portions of the cortex with feature resolution down to the micron scale become tractable with even modest computer resources. The feasibility and accuracy of the novel method is demonstrated and validated with in vivo oxygen perfusion data in cohorts of young and aged mice. Our oxygen exchange simulations quantify steep gradients near penetrating blood vessels and point towards pathological changes that might cause neurodegeneration in aged brains. This research aims to explain mechanistic interactions between anatomical structures and how they might change in diseases or with age. Rigorous quantification of age-related changes is of significant interest because it might aide in the search for imaging biomarkers for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. © 2021 Hartung et al.",,"adult; aged; animal experiment; Article; brain blood flow; brain cortex; brain oxygen tension; brain perfusion; cerebral oxygen perfusiuon; controlled study; hypoxia; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; microvasculature; middle aged; mouse; multiphoton microscopy; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; oxygen transport; prediction; sensory cortex; simulation; tissue oxygenation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100624504

Currently, a key limitation of the experimental protocol and associated finite element (FE) models is that the exact load transfer, and consequently the loading conditions on the tibial plateau, is unknown. Often in FE models, load is applied to the tibial plateau based on inferences from micro-computed tomography (μCT). Experimental models often use a single strain gauge to assess the three-dimensional (3D) loading state. However, a single strain gauge is insufficient to validate such FE models. To address this challenge, we develop an experimentally calibrated method for identifying the load application region on the tibial plateau based upon measurements from three strain gauges. To achieve this, axial compression was conducted on mouse tibiae (n=3), with strains gauges on three surfaces. FE simulations were performed to compute the strains at the gauge locations as a function of a variable load location. By minimising the error between experimental and FE strains, the precise load location was identified; this was found to vary between tibia specimens. It was further shown that commonly used FE loading conditions, found in literature, did not replicate the experimental strain distribution, highlighting the importance of load calibration. This work provides critical insights into how load is transferred to the tibial plateau. Importantly, this work develops an experimentally informed technique for loading the tibial plateau in FE models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bone adaptation; Bone mechanics; Finite element modelling; Mouse tibia loading; Strain gauging","Bone; Computerized tomography; Location; Strain; Strain gages; Compression loading; Experimental models; Experimental protocols; Experimental strains; Mechanical loading; Microcomputed tomography; Strain distributions; Threedimensional (3-d); Finite element method; adaptation; animal experiment; Article; biomechanics; calibration; compression; female; finite element analysis; in vivo study; measurement precision; micro-computed tomography; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; tibial plateau; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098455898

Design: General surgery residents were asked to perform the laparoscopic peg transfer task on a trainer equipped with a motion tracker. They were also asked to perform the laparoscopic task while completing a secondary task. Extreme velocity and acceleration events of instrument movement in the 3 rotational degrees of freedom were measured during task completion. The number of extreme events, defined as velocity or acceleration exceeding 1 SD above or below their own mean, were tabulated. The performance of junior residents was compared to senior residents. Setting: Simulation learning institute, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan. Participants: Thirty-seven general surgery residents from Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak. Results: When completing the primary task alone, senior residents executed significantly fewer extreme motion events specific to acceleration in pitch (16.63 vs. 20.69, p = 0.04), and executed more extreme motion events specific to velocity in roll (16.14 vs. 15.11, p = 0.038), when compared to junior residents. With addition of a secondary task, senior residents had fewer extreme acceleration events specific to pitch, (14.69 vs. 22.22, p < 0.001).

To tackle the challenge of growing multimorbidity worldwide, practices without disease-specific focus have shown better integration of services. However, as we move away from the familiar disease-specific approaches of care delivery, many of us are still learning how to implement generalist care in a cost-effective manner. Methods This mixed-method case study, which centred on a specialist-led General Medicine model implemented at an acute hospital in Singapore, aimed to (1) quantitatively summarise its clinical outcomes, and (2) qualitatively describe the challenges and lessons gathered from the pragmatic implementation of the care model. Quantitative hospital data were extracted from databases and summarised. Qualitative staff-reported experiences and insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Quantitative findings revealed that the generalist care model was implemented with high fidelity, where more than 75% of patients admitted were placed under General Medicine’s or General Surgery’s care. The mean length of stay was 2.6 days, and the 30-day post-discharge readmission rate was 15%. Inpatient mortality rate was found to be 2.8%, and the average gross hospitalisation bill amounted to SGD3,085.30. For qualitative findings, themes concerning feasibility and operational aspects of the implementation were grouped into categories- (1) Feasibility of ‘One Care Team’ approach, (2) Enablers required for meaningful generalist care, (3) Challenges surrounding information sharing, (4) Lack of integration with the community to facilitate care transition, and (5) Evolving roles of self-management. The findings were rich, with some being identified as barriers that could benefit from system-level de-constraining. Discussion This case study was an illustration of our pursuit for an integrated solution to rising prevalence of multimorbidity. While quantitative findings indicated that a pivot towards General Medicine might be possible, data also revealed gaps in clinical outcomes, especially in readmission rates. These findings corroborated with much of the lessons and challenges gathered from qualitative interviews, specifically surrounding the lack of receptacles in the community to facilitate care transition, training, and competency of generalists in holistic management of complex multimorbid cases, as well as inadequate infrastructure to allow information sharing between providers. Thus, a multi-pronged approach might be required to develop a new and sustainable care model for patients with multimorbidity in the long run. In the short to medium transitional period, nonetheless, the specialist-led General Medicine care model demonstrated might be a viable interim approach, especially in circumstances where trained medical generalists remained limited.

In addition to showing important emergent properties, our model generalizes the popular “top-N news recommender systems” in a manner that provides media managers a mechanism to guide the emergent outcomes to mitigate potentially unhealthy outcomes driven by the self-organizing dynamics. We use complex adaptive systems framework to model the popularity evolution of news articles. In particular, we use agent-based simulation to model a reader's behavior at the microscopic level and study the impact of various simulation hyperparameters on overall emergent phenomena. This simulation exercise enables us to show how the feedback model can be used as an alternative recommender to conventional top-N systems.

Despite detailed understanding of the mechanisms of signal production and response, there remains considerable debate over the functional role(s) of QS: in short, what is it for? Experimental studies have found support for diverse functional roles: density sensing, mass-transfer sensing, genotype sensing, etc. While consistent with theory, these results cannot separate whether these functions were drivers of QS adaption, or simply artifacts or ‘spandrels’ of systems shaped by distinct ecological pressures. The challenge of separating spandrels from drivers of adaptation is particularly hard to address using extant bacterial species with poorly understood current ecologies (let alone their ecological histories). To understand the relationship between defined ecological challenges and trajectories of QS evolution, we used an agent-based simulation modeling approach. Given genetic mixing, our simulations produce behaviors that recapitulate features of diverse microbial QS systems, including coercive (high signal/low response) and generalized reciprocity (signal auto-regulation) strategists — that separately and in combination contribute to QS-dependent resilience of QS-controlled cooperation in the face of diverse cheats. We contrast our in silico results given defined ecological challenges with bacterial QS architectures that have evolved under largely unknown ecological contexts, highlighting the critical role of genetic constraints in shaping the shorter term (experimental evolution) dynamics of QS. More broadly, we see experimental evolution of digital organisms as a complementary tool in the search to understand the emergence of complex QS architectures and functions. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"article; artifact; autoregulation; computer model; ecology; human; quorum sensing; simulation; theoretical study; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; metabolism; physiology; quorum sensing; theoretical model; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Models, Theoretical; Quorum Sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085306111

Although previous methods often treat the detection of each putative connection as a separate hypothesis test, here we develop a modeling approach that infers synaptic connections while incorporating circuit properties learned from the whole network. We use an extension of the generalized linear model framework to describe the cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons and separate correlograms into two parts: a slowly varying effect due to background fluctuations and a fast, transient effect due to the synapse. We then use the observations from all putative connections in the recording to estimate two network properties: the presynaptic neuron type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the relationship between synaptic latency and distance between neurons. Constraining the presynaptic neuron's type, synaptic latencies, and time constants improves synapse detection. In data from simulated networks, this model outperforms two previously developed synapse detection methods, especially on the weak connections. We also apply our model to in vitro multielectrode array recordings from the mouse somatosensory cortex. Here, our model automatically recovers plausible connections from hundreds of neurons, and the properties of the putative connections are largely consistent with previous research.

It is generally accepted that a crucial factor for this ability is the use of abstract, hierarchical representations, which employ structure in the environment to guide learning and decision making. Nevertheless, how we create and use these hierarchical representations is poorly understood. This study presents evidence that human behavior can be characterized as hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). We designed an experiment to test specific predictions of hierarchical RL using a series of subtasks in the realm of context-based learning and observed several behavioral markers of hierarchical RL, such as asymmetric switch costs between changes in higher-level versus lower-level features, faster learning in higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts, and preference for higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts. We replicated these results across three independent samples. We simulated three models-a classic RL, a hierarchical RL, and a hierarchical Bayesian model-and compared their behavior to human results. While the flat RL model captured some aspects of participants' sensitivity to outcome values, and the hierarchical Bayesian model captured some markers of transfer, only hierarchical RL accounted for all patterns observed in human behavior. This work shows that hierarchical RL, a biologically inspired and computationally simple algorithm, can capture human behavior in complex, hierarchical environments and opens the avenue for future research in this field. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Balanced spiking networks (BSNs) provide a powerful framework for implementing arbitrary linear dynamical systems in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. However, the classic BSN model requires near-instantaneous transmission of spikes between neurons, which is biologically implausible. Introducing realistic synaptic delays leads to an pathological regime known as “ping-ponging”, in which different populations spike maximally in alternating time bins, causing network output to overshoot the target solution. Here we document this phenomenon and provide a novel solution: we show that a network can have realistic synaptic delays while maintaining accuracy and stability if neurons are endowed with conditionally Poisson firing. Formally, we propose two alternate formulations of Poisson balanced spiking networks: (1) a “local” framework, which replaces the hard integrate-and-fire spiking rule within each neuron by a “soft” threshold function, such that firing probability grows as a smooth nonlinear function of membrane potential; and (2) a “population” framework, which reformulates the BSN objective function in terms of expected spike counts over the entire population. We show that both approaches offer improved robustness, allowing for accurate implementation of network dynamics with realistic synaptic delays between neurons. Both Poisson frameworks preserve the coding accuracy and robustness to neuron loss of the original model and, moreover, produce positive correlations between similarly tuned neurons, a feature of real neural populations that is not found in the deterministic BSN. This work unifies balanced spiking networks with Poisson generalized linear models and suggests several promising avenues for future research. © 2020 Rullán Buxó, Pillow.

The resulting quantum bumps (QBs) vary in their timing (latency), amplitudes and durations, and these variabilities within each cell are not correlated. Using modeling and electrophysiological recordings, we investigated how the QB properties depend on the cascade speed and how they influence signal transfer. Parametric analysis in the model supported by experimental data revealed that faster cascades elicit larger and narrower QBs with faster onsets and smaller variabilities than slower cascades. Latency dispersion was stronger affected by modification of upstream than downstream activation parameters. The variability caused by downstream modifications closely matched the experimental variability. Frequency response modeling showed that corner frequency is a reciprocal function of the characteristic duration of the multiphoton response, which, in turn, is a non-linear function of QB duration and latency dispersion. All QB variabilities contributed noise but only latency dispersion slowed and spread multiphoton responses, lowering the corner frequency. Using the discovered QB correlations, we evaluated transduction noise for dissimilar species and two extreme adaptation states, and compared it to photon noise. The noise emitted by the cascade was non-additive and depended non-linearly on the interaction between the QB duration and the three QB variabilities. Increased QB duration strongly suppressed both noise and corner frequency. This trade-off might be acceptable for nocturnal but not diurnal species because corner frequency is the principal determinant of information capacity. To offset the increase in noise accompanying the QB narrowing during light adaptation and the response-expanding effect of latency dispersion, the cascade accelerates. This explains the widespread evolutionary tendency of diurnal fliers to have fast phototransduction, especially after light adaptation, which thus appears to be a common adaptation to contain stochasticity, improve SNR and expand the bandwidth. © 2020 Frolov, Ignatova.

The etiology of MS is multifactorial, with disease risk determined by genetics and environmental factors. An emerging risk factor for immune-mediated diseases is an imbalance in the gut microbiome. However, the identity of gut microbes associated with disease risk, their mechanisms of action, and the interactions with host genetics remain obscure. To address these questions, we utilized the principal autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), together with a genetically diverse mouse model representing 29 unique host genotypes, interrogated by microbiome sequencing and targeted microbiome manipulation. We identified specific gut bacteria and their metabolic functions associated with EAE susceptibility, implicating short-chain fatty acid metabolism as a key element conserved across multiple host genotypes. In parallel, we used a reductionist approach focused on two of the most disparate phenotypes identified in our screen. Manipulation of the gut microbiome by transplantation and cohousing demonstrated that transfer of these microbiomes into genetically identical hosts was sufficient to modulate EAE susceptibility and systemic metabolite profiles. Parallel bioinformatic approaches identified Lactobacillus reuteri as a commensal species unexpectedly associated with exacerbation of EAE in a genetically susceptible host, which was functionally confirmed by bacterial isolation and commensal colonization studies.

Following endocytosis, it is widely understood that protein antigens must be transferred from endosomes to the cytosol where they are subject to ubiquitination and proteasome degradation prior to being translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or possibly endosomes, via the TAP1/TAP2 complex. Revealing how antigens egress from endocytic organelles (endosome-to-cytosol transfer, ECT), however, has proved vexing. Here, we used two independent screens to identify the hydrogen peroxide-transporting channel aquaporin-3 (AQP3) as a regulator of ECT. AQP3 overexpression increased ECT, whereas AQP3 knockout or knockdown decreased ECT. Mechanistically, AQP3 appears to be important for hydrogen peroxide entry into the endosomal lumen where it affects lipid peroxidation and subsequent antigen release. AQP3-mediated regulation of ECT was functionally significant, as AQP3 modulation had a direct impact on the efficiency of antigen cross presentation in vitro. Finally, AQP3-/- mice exhibited a reduced ability to mount an anti-viral response and cross present exogenous extended peptide. Together, these results indicate that the AQP3-mediated transport of hydrogen peroxide can regulate endosomal lipid peroxidation and suggest that compromised membrane integrity and coordinated release of endosomal cargo is a likely mechanism for ECT. © 2020 Nalle et al.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the stress response of orthodontic forces on the periodontal system, bone tissues, mini-implant and the bracket-enamel interface. Methods: Computer tomography images of a commercially available mini-implant, an orthodontic bracket bonded to a central incisor, and jawbone section models were used to reconstruct three dimensional computer models. These models were exported and meshed in an ABAQUSⓇ finite-element package. Material properties, multi-segment interactions, boundary and loading conditions were then applied to each component. Finite-element analyses were conducted to elucidate the effect of orthodontic force on the equivalent von Mises stress response within the simulated orthodontic system. Results: The highest stress values in the orthodontic system were predicted at the mini-implant neck, at the interface of the cortical bone, and gradually decreased in the internal apical direction of the miniscrew. On the alveolar bone, the maximum stress values were located in the alveolar cortical bone near the cervical areas of the mini-implant, which is in line with clinical findings of area where bone loss was found post orthodontic tooth treatment. Another peak of von Mises stress response was found in the enamel bracket junction with a maximum up to 186.05 MPa. To ensure good bonding between the enamel and bracket, it is vital to select carefully the type and amount of bonding materials used in the bracket-enamel interface to assure an appropriate load distribution between the teeth and alveolar bone. The results also revealed the significance of the periodontal ligaments, acting as an intermediate cushion element, in the load transfer mechanism. Conclusions: This study is sought to identify the stress response in a simulated orthodontic system to minimize the failure rate of mini-implants and bracket loss during orthodontic treatment. © 2020","Finite-element method; Mini-implant; Orthodontic system; Stress distribution; Tooth","ABAQUS; Bone; Enamels; Failure analysis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Computer tomography images; Finite element packages; Load distributions; Load transfer mechanism; Orthodontic brackets; Orthodontic tooth movements; Orthodontic treatments; Periodontal ligament; Finite element method; alveolar bone; Article; biomechanics; central incisor; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; computer model; cortical bone; enamel; finite element analysis; force; image reconstruction; incisor; jaw; mandible; orthodontic procedure; orthodontic tooth movement; osteolysis; periodontal ligament; stress; trabecular bone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085739787

The longer the time to viral rebound, the more efficacious the therapy. In support of such an approach, mathematical models serve as a connection between the size of the latent reservoir and the time to HIV-1 rebound after treatment interruption. The simplest of such models assumes that a single successful latent cell reactivation event leads to observable viremia after a period of exponential viral growth. Here we consider a generalization developed by Pinkevych et al. and Hill et al. of this simple model in which multiple reactivation events can occur, each contributing to the exponential growth of the viral load. We formalize and improve the previous derivation of the dynamics predicted by this model, and use the model to estimate relevant biological parameters from SIV rebound data. We confirm a previously described effect of very early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the rate of recrudescence and the viral load growth rate after treatment interruption. We find that every day ART initiation is delayed results in a 39% increase in the recrudescence rate (95% credible interval: [18%, 62%]), and a 11% decrease of the viral growth rate (95% credible interval: [4%, 20%]). We show that when viral rebound occurs early relative to the viral load doubling time, a model with multiple successful reactivation events fits the data better than a model with only a single successful reactivation event.

Research has tested the relative contributions of these sources of information and found mixed results, with some studies demonstrating the importance of body-based information, especially for translation, and some demonstrating the sufficiency of visual information. Here, we invoke an individual differences approach to test whether some individuals may be more dependent on certain types of information compared to others. Movement experts tend to be dependent on motor processes in small-scale spatial tasks, which can help or hurt performance, but it is unknown if this effect extends into large-scale spatial tasks like spatial updating. In the current study, expert dancers and non-dancers completed a virtual reality point-to-origin task with three locomotion methods that varied the availability of body-based and visual information for translation: walking, joystick, and teleporting. We predicted decrements in performance in both groups as self-motion information was reduced, and that dancers would show a larger cost. Surprisingly, both dancers and non-dancers performed with equal accuracy in walking and joystick and were impaired in teleporting, with no large differences between groups. We found slower response times for both groups with reductions in self-motion information, and minimal evidence for a larger cost for dancers. While we did not see strong dance effects, more participation in spatial activities related to decreased angular error. Together, the results suggest a flexibility in reliance on visual or body-based information for translation in spatial updating that generalizes across dancers and non-dancers, but significant decrements associated with removing both of these sources of information. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dance expertise; Spatial updating; Virtual locomotion methods","adult; article; dancing; female; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; male; motion; reaction time; virtual reality; visual information; walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086594787

In particular, weak, lateral (cis) interactions between E-cadherin extracellular domains tethered to supported lipid bilayers, were studied using a combination of dynamic single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Cadherins are intercellular adhesion proteins that assemble into clusters at cell-cell contacts through cis-and trans-(adhesive) interactions. A detailed and quantitative understanding of cis-clustering has been hindered by a lack of experimental approaches capable of detecting and quantifying lateral interactions between proteins on membranes. Here single-molecule intermolecular FRET measurements of wild-type E-cadherin and cis-interaction mutants combined with simulations demonstrate that both nonspecific and specific cis-interactions contribute to lateral clustering on lipid bilayers. Moreover, the intermolecular binding and dissociation rate constants are quantitatively and independently determined, demonstrating an approach that is generalizable for other interacting proteins. © Thompson et al.",,"cadherin; CDH1 protein, human; leukocyte antigen; protein binding; chemistry; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; metabolism; single molecule imaging; Antigens, CD; Cadherins; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Protein Binding; Single Molecule Imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091323669

Participants rated, on a five-point scale, correct and ungrammatical sentences describing events of causation (e.g., *Someone laughed the man; Someone made the man laugh; Someone broke the truck; ?Someone made the truck break). The verb-semantics hypothesis predicts that, for all languages, by-verb differences in acceptability ratings will be predicted by the extent to which the causing and caused event (e.g., amusing and laughing) merge conceptually into a single event (as rated by separate groups of adult participants). The entrenchment and preemption hypotheses predict, for all languages, that by-verb differences in acceptability ratings will be predicted by, respectively, the verb's relative overall frequency, and frequency in nearly-synonymous constructions (e.g., X made Y laugh for *Someone laughed the man). Analysis using mixed effects models revealed that entrenchment/preemption effects (which could not be distinguished due to collinearity) were observed for all age groups and all languages except K'iche', which suffered from a thin corpus and showed only preemption sporadically. All languages showed effects of event-merge semantics, except K'iche' which showed only effects of supplementary semantic predictors. We end by presenting a computational model which successfully simulates this pattern of results in a single discriminative-learning mechanism, achieving by-verb correlations of around r = 0.75 with human judgment data. © 2020 The Author(s)","Causative; Child language acquisition; English; Entrenchment; Hebrew; Hindi; Japanese; K'iche; Preemption; Verb semantics","adult; article; case report; child; clinical article; computer model; decision making; discrimination learning; groups by age; Hindi; human; human experiment; language development; laughter; male; preschool child; semantics; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086877259

Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more abstract, conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains. Yet both behavioral and model-based analyses suggest domain specific differences in how these representations map onto actions. Copyright: © 2020 Wu et al.

In such situations, social information can be leveraged to improve individual learning outcomes. Here, we investigated how participants used their own experiences and others' social cues to avoid harm. Participants made repeated choices between harmful and safe options, each with different probabilities of generating shocks, while also seeing the image of a social partner. Some partners made predictive gaze cues towards the harmful choice option while others cued an option at random, and did so using neutral or fearful facial expressions. We tested how learned social information about partner reliability transferred across contexts by letting participants encounter the same partner in multiple trial blocks while facing novel choice options. Participants' decisions were best explained by a reinforcement learning model that independently learned the probabilities of options being safe and of partners being reliable and combined these combined these estimates to generate choices. Advice from partners making a fearful facial expression influenced participants' decisions more than advice from partners with neutral expressions. Our results showed that participants made better decisions when facing predictive partners and that they cached and transferred partner reliability estimates into new blocks. Using simulations we show that participants' transfer of social information into novel contexts is better adapted to variable social environments where social partners may change their cuing strategy or become untrustworthy. Finally, we found no relation between autism questionnaire scores and performance in our task, but do find autism trait related differences in learning rate parameters.

We enrolled a cohort of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–recovered participants, developed neutralization assays to investigate antibody responses, adapted our high-throughput antibody generation pipeline to rapidly screen more than 1800 antibodies, and established an animal model to test protection. We isolated potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to two epitopes on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and to distinct non-RBD epitopes on the spike (S) protein. As indicated by maintained weight and low lung viral titers in treated animals, the passive transfer of a nAb provides protection against disease in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. The study suggests a role for nAbs in prophylaxis, and potentially therapy, of COVID-19. The nAbs also define protective epitopes to guide vaccine design.

Here we combine functional imaging and computational modeling to identify the neural systems that support the discovery and transfer of hierarchical task structure. Human subjects (male and female) completed multiple blocks of a reinforcement learning task that contained a global hierarchical structure governing stimulus-response action mapping. First, behavioral and computational evidence showed that humans successfully discover and transfer the hierarchical rule structure embedded within the task. Next, analysis of fMRI BOLD data revealed activity across a frontoparietal network that was specifically associated with the discovery of this embedded structure. Finally, activity throughout a cingulo-opercular network supported the transfer and implementation of this discovered structure.

It is usually performed in vivo by combining acquisitions with multiple signal readouts, which exhibit different thermal noise levels, geometrical distortions and susceptibility to physiological noise. This ultimately hinders joint multi-contrast modelling and makes the geometric correspondence of parametric maps challenging. We propose an approach to overcome these limitations, by implementing state-of-the-art microstructural MRI of the spinal cord with a unified signal readout in vivo (i.e. with matched spatial encoding parameters across a range of imaging contrasts). We base our acquisition on single-shot echo planar imaging with reduced field-of-view, and obtain data from two different vendors (vendor 1: Philips Achieva; vendor 2: Siemens Prisma). Importantly, the unified acquisition allows us to compare signal and noise across contrasts, thus enabling overall quality enhancement via multi-contrast image denoising methods. As a proof-of-concept, here we provide a demonstration with one such method, known as Marchenko-Pastur (MP) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) denoising. MP-PCA is a singular value (SV) decomposition truncation approach that relies on redundant acquisitions, i.e. such that the number of measurements is large compared to the number of components that are maintained in the truncated SV decomposition. Here we used in vivo and synthetic data to test whether a unified readout enables more efficient MP-PCA denoising of less redundant acquisitions, since these can be denoised jointly with more redundant ones. We demonstrate that a unified readout provides robust multi-parametric maps, including diffusion and kurtosis tensors from diffusion MRI, myelin metrics from two-pool magnetisation transfer, and T1 and T2 from relaxometry. Moreover, we show that MP-PCA improves the quality of our multi-contrast acquisitions, since it reduces the coefficient of variation (i.e. variability) by up to 17% for mean kurtosis, 8% for bound pool fraction (myelin-sensitive), and 13% for T1, while enabling more efficient denoising of modalities limited in redundancy (e.g. relaxometry). In conclusion, multi-parametric spinal cord qMRI with unified readout is feasible and provides robust microstructural metrics with matched resolution and distortions, whose quality benefits from multi-contrast denoising methods such as MP-PCA. © 2020","Marchenko-Pastur PCA denoising; Multi-parametric MRI; Quantitative MRI; Signal readout; Spinal cord","Article; diffusion weighted imaging; image analysis; image denoising; image processing; image quality; imaging and display; in vivo study; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; neuroimaging; priority journal; signal noise ratio; spinal cord; unified signal readout; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; devices; diagnostic imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; echo planar imaging; human; image enhancement; myelin sheath; pathology; principal component analysis; procedures; spinal cord; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Echo-Planar Imaging; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Myelin Sheath; Principal Component Analysis; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Spinal Cord",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084441403

Our Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) predicts stability using physically motivated summary statistics measured in integrations of the first 104 orbits, thus achieving speed-ups of up to 105 over full simulations. This computationally opens up the stability-constrained characterization of multiplanet systems. Our model, trained on_100,000 three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances, generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on systems' angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit-duration measurements for small planets and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit-timing variations (TTVs). Given that current exoplanet-detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints [S. Hadden, T. Barclay, M. J. Payne, M. J. Holman, Astrophys. J. 158, 146 (2019)], SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing compact multiplanet systems.

Spatially structured metapopulation models are flexible and can use real data but often at the cost of generality. Particularly as resources for management of such species are often critically limited, endangered species management guided by metapopulation modeling requires incorporation of biological realism. Here we developed a flexible, stochastic spatially structured metapopulation model of the profoundly endangered Amargosa vole, a microtine rodent with an extant population of only a few hundred individuals within 1km2 of habitat in the Mojave Desert. Drought and water insecurity are increasing extinction risks considerably. We modelled subpopulation demographics using a Ricker-like model with migration implemented in an incidence function metapopulation model. A set of scenarios was used to assess the effect of anthropogenic stressors or management actions on expected time to extinction (Te) including: 1) wildland fire, 2) anthropogenically-mediated losses of hydrologic flows, 3) drought, 4) intentional expansion of existing patches into 'megamarshes' (i.e. via restoration/enhancement), and 5) additive impacts of multiple influences. In isolation, marshes could be sources or sinks, but spatial context within the full metapopulation including adjacency could alter relative impacts of subpopulations on all other subpopulations. The greatest reductions in persistence occurred in scenarios simulated with impacts from drought in combination with fire or anthropogenically-mediated losses of hydrologic flows. Optimal actions to improve persistence were to prevent distant and smaller marshes from acting as sinks through strategic creation of megamarshes that act as sources of voles and stepping-stones. This research reinforces that management resources expended without guidance from empirically-based modeling can actually harm species' persistence. This metapopulation-PVA tool could easily be implemented for other patchily-distributed endangered species and allow managers to maximize scarce resources to improve the likelihood of endangered species persistence.

As residents and fellows participate as learners in simulations, which faculty design, this investigation sought to address whether fellows and faculty have similar perceptions of fidelity by comparing ratings of 2 types of simulation experiences. Methods Prospective single-center observational study comparing surveys completed by fellows and faculty participating in multiple simulation sessions during a one-day simulation-based boot camp. Results Overall, both the fellows and the faculty provided moderate to high ratings of fidelity for both a technical skill and a teamwork simulation session. Fellows' ratings of an airway skills session were significantly higher than faculty ratings in 4 of 6 questions but similar to faculty ratings of a teamwork scenario session. Conclusions Pediatric anesthesia fellows' ratings of simulation fidelity were at least as high as faculty ratings during an annual boot camp, suggesting that faculty in this setting developed simulations that the fellows found to be realistic. Faculty were relatively more critical of the fidelity of a skill session, compared with a teamwork scenario session. If this finding is generalizable, this may reassure faculty designing simulations for fellows. Continued inspection of the entwined nature of fidelity and simulation will help inform more effective learning for this growing educational modality. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Fidelity; medical education; simulation","adult; airway; article; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; medical education; observational study; pediatric anesthesia; perception; pilot study; prospective study; resident; simulation; skill; teamwork",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089301075

Action potentials propagate through long axons to their postsynaptic partners, which requires axons not only to faithfully transfer action potentials to distant synaptic regions but also to maintain their timing. This is particularly challenging when axons differ in their morphological and physiological properties, as timing is predicted to diverge between these axons when extrinsic conditions change. It is unknown if and how diverse axons maintain timing during temperature changes that animals and humans encounter. We studied whether ambient temperature changes cause different timing in the periphery of neurons that centrally produce temperature-robust activity. In an approach combining modeling, imaging, and electrophysiology, we explored mechanisms that support timing by exposing the axons of three different neuron types from the same crustacean (Cancer borealis) motor circuit and involved in the same functional task to a range of physiological temperatures. We show that despite substantial differences between axons, the effects of temperature on action potential propagation were moderate and supported temperature-robust timing over long-distances. Our modeling demonstrates that to maintain timing, the underlying channel properties of these axons do not need to be temperature-insensitive or highly restricted, but coordinating the temperature sensitivities of the Sodium activation gate time constant and the maximum Sodium conductance is required. Thus, even highly temperature-sensitive ion channel properties can support temperature-robust timing between distinct neuronal types and across long distances.

In previous studies, these two tasks have often been considered separately. However, the entities studied in these two tasks (i.e., drugs, targets, and diseases) are inherently related. On one hand, drugs interact with targets in cells to modulate target activities, which in turn alter biological pathways to promote healthy functions and to treat diseases. On the other hand, both drug repositioning and drug-target prediction involve the same drug feature space, which naturally connects these two problems and the two domains (diseases and targets). By using the wisdom of the crowds, it is possible to transfer knowledge from one of the domains to the other. The existence of relationships among drug-target-disease motivates us to jointly consider drug repositioning and drug-target prediction in drug discovery. In this paper, we present a novel approach called iDrug, which seamlessly integrates drug repositioning and drug-target prediction into one coherent model via cross-network embedding. In particular, we provide a principled way to transfer knowledge from these two domains and to enhance prediction performance for both tasks. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that iDrug achieves superior performance on both learning tasks compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

Repression requires the assembly of a methylation-dependent silencing complex that contains the TRIM28 protein (also known as KAP1 and TIF1β), a scaffolding protein without intrinsic repressive or DNA-binding properties. The identity of the key effector within this complex that represses transcription is unknown. We developed a methylation-sensitized interaction screen which revealed that TRIM28 was complexed with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) only in cells that had normal genomic methylation patterns. OGT is the only glycosyltransferase that modifies cytoplasmic and nuclear protein by transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine hydroxyls.Whole-genome analysis showed that O-glycosylated proteins and TRIM28 were specifically bound to promoters of active retrotransposons and to imprinting control regions, the two major regulatory sequences controlled by DNA methylation. Furthermore, genome-wide loss of DNA methylation caused a loss of O-GlcNAc from multiple transcriptional repressor proteins associated with TRIM28. A newly developed Cas9-based editing method for targeted removal of O-GlcNAc was directed against retrotransposon promoters.

These are based on factors governing personal economic decisions: incentive, appetite, and learning. We find that the addictive process is an extreme expression of aesthetic dynamics. An interactive, agent-based model, ASIMOV, reproduces a simple aesthetic sense from known neural relations of cost-benefit decision in foraging. In the presence of very high reward, an addiction-like process emerges. A drug-like prey provides extreme reward with no nutritive value, initiating high selectivity and prolonged cravings for drug through reward learning. Varying reward experience, caused by homeostatic changes in the neural circuitry of reward, further establishes the course of addiction, consisting of desensitization, withdrawal, resensitization, and associated changes in nutritional choice and pain sensitivity. These observations are consistent with the early evolution of addiction mechanisms in simple generalist foragers as an aesthetic sense for evaluating prey. ASIMOV is accessible to inspection, modification, and experiment, is adaptable as an educational tool, and provides insight on the possible coevolutionary origins of aesthetics and the addiction process.",,"addiction; algorithm; animal; computer simulation; esthetics; evolution; feeding behavior; physiology; Pleurobranchaea; predation; psychology; Algorithms; Animals; Behavior, Addictive; Biological Evolution; Computer Simulation; Esthetics; Feeding Behavior; Pleurobranchaea; Predatory Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086624796

Recently, investigators have questioned whether a low-dimensional controller can produce the rich and flexible behaviours seen in everyday movements. To study this issue, we implemented muscle synergies in a biomechanically realistic model of the human upper extremity and performed computational experiments to determine whether synergies introduced task performance deficits, facilitated the learning of movements, and generalized to different movements. We derived sets of synergies from the muscle excitations our dynamic optimizations computed for a nominal task (reaching in a plane). Then we compared the performance and learning rates of a controller that activated all muscles independently to controllers that activated the synergies derived from the nominal reaching task. We found that a controller based on synergies had errors within 1 cm of a full-dimensional controller and achieved faster learning rates (as estimated from computational time to converge). The synergy-based controllers could also accomplish new tasks - such as reaching to targets on a higher or lower plane, and starting from alternative initial poses - with average errors similar to a full-dimensional controller. © 2020 The Author(s).","modularity; motor control; predictive simulation; reaching; synergies","Computational methods; Muscle; Central nervous systems; Computational analysis; Computational experiment; Computational time; Dynamic optimization; Muscle synergies; Task performance; Upper extremity; Controllers; article; human; human experiment; learning; motor control; muscle excitation; simulation; task performance; upper limb",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089571121

Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy-the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)-dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: Slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the ""territoriality benefits""hypothesis-where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes. © 2020 White et al.",,"Article; disease course; disease duration; disease severity; disease transmission; epidemic; epidemiological data; host pathogen interaction; human; infection rate; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nonhuman; parasitism; pathogen load; population migration; prevalence; social behavior; territoriality; wildlife; animal; animal behavior; biological model; computer simulation; ecology; homing behavior; probability; statistical model; pheromone; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Computer Simulation; Disease Outbreaks; Ecology; Homing Behavior; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pheromones; Prevalence; Probability; Territoriality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086355724

Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning—and specifically state-space expansion and reduction—within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) “slots” that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning—associated with these slots—can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show that it can accomplish a simple form of “one-shot” generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide a template for how future active inference research could apply this approach to real-world structure learning problems and assess the added utility it may offer. © Copyright © 2020 Smith, Schwartenbeck, Parr and Friston.","active inference; Bayesian model expansion; Bayesian model reduction; computational neuroscience; concept learning; concepts; structure learning","Bayesian networks; Bioinformatics; Computational neuroscience; Expansion; Algorithmic model; Concept learning; Internal modeling; Model complexity; Modeling structures; Neurocomputational models; Structure-learning; Underlying cause; Machine learning; article; human; human experiment; learning; neuroscience; simulation; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085860281

Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly employed for rehabilitation after neuromuscular traumas such as stroke and spinal cord injury. However, VR methods still need to be optimized for greater effectiveness and engagement to increase rates of clinical retention. In this study, we observed that training with disproportionate PF subsequently produced greater reaching performance (minimizing path length) and greater agency (perception of control) than with disproportionate NF. During PF training, there was also progressive increase in agency, but conversely a decrease in performance. Thus, the increase in performance after training may not be due to positively bolstered learning, but rather priming higher confidence reflected in greater agency. Agency was positively measured as compression in perceived time-intervals between the action of touch to a sound consequence, as standard with intentional binding paradigms. Positive feedback desirably increased agency (∼180 msec) and reduced path length (1.8 cm) compared to negative feedback, which itself showed insignificant, or neutral, effects. Future investigations into optimizing virtual reality paradigms for neuromotor rehabilitation should consider agency as a driving factor for performance. These studies may serve to optimize how feedback is better presented with performance results for complex motor learning. Investigators should also ponder how personal characteristics, both cognitive and physical, may further affect sensitivity to feedback and the rate of neuromotor rehabilitation. © 2020 Nataraj et al.

In addition, many machine learning methods have limited ability to address the issues of controlling false discoveries and adjusting for covariates. To address these challenges, we develop a new feature selection technique called Nearest-neighbor Projected-Distance Regression (NPDR) that calculates the importance of each predictor using generalized linear model regression of distances between nearest-neighbor pairs projected onto the predictor dimension. NPDR captures the underlying interaction structure of data using nearest-neighbors in high dimensions, handles both dichotomous and continuous outcomes and predictor data types, statistically corrects for covariates, and permits statistical inference and penalized regression. We use realistic simulations with interactions and other effects to show that NPDR has better precision-recall than standard Relief-based feature selection and random forest importance, with the additional benefit of covariate adjustment and multiple testing correction. Using RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder (MDD), we show that NPDR with covariate adjustment removes spurious associations due to confounding. We apply NPDR to eQTL data to identify potentially interacting variants that regulate transcripts associated with MDD and demonstrate NPDR's utility for GWAS and continuous outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

Neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have provided significant insights into the neural processing of continuous stimuli, such as speech, thanks to their high temporal resolution. Existing work in the context of auditory processing suggests that certain features of speech, such as the acoustic envelope, can be used as reliable linear predictors of the neural response manifested in M/EEG. The corresponding linear filters are referred to as temporal response functions (TRFs). While the functional roles of specific components of the TRF are well-studied and linked to behavioral attributes such as attention, the cortical origins of the underlying neural processes are not as well understood. In this work, we address this issue by estimating a linear filter representation of cortical sources directly from neuroimaging data in the context of continuous speech processing. To this end, we introduce Neuro-Current Response Functions (NCRFs), a set of linear filters, spatially distributed throughout the cortex, that predict the cortical currents giving rise to the observed ongoing MEG (or EEG) data in response to continuous speech. NCRF estimation is cast within a Bayesian framework, which allows unification of the TRF and source estimation problems, and also facilitates the incorporation of prior information on the structural properties of the NCRFs. To generalize this analysis to M/EEG recordings which lack individual structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans, NCRFs are extended to free-orientation dipoles and a novel regularizing scheme is put forward to lessen reliance on fine-tuned coordinate co-registration. We present a fast estimation algorithm, which we refer to as the Champ-Lasso algorithm, by leveraging recent advances in optimization, and demonstrate its utility through application to simulated and experimentally recorded MEG data under auditory experiments. Our simulation studies reveal significant improvements over existing methods that typically operate in a two-stage fashion, in terms of spatial resolution, response function reconstruction, and recovering dipole orientations. The analysis of experimentally-recorded MEG data without MR scans corroborates existing findings, but also delineates the distinct cortical distribution of the underlying neural processes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In summary, we provide a principled modeling and estimation paradigm for MEG source analysis tailored to extracting the cortical origin of electrophysiological responses to continuous stimuli. © 2020 The Authors","Bayesian estimation; MEG; Source localization; Speech processing; Temporal response functions","adult; algorithm; Article; auditory cortex; Bayes theorem; Champ Lasso algorithm; controlled study; electroencephalography; frontal cortex; human; human experiment; inferior frontal gyrus; inferior temporal cortex; information processing; left hemisphere; magnetoencephalography; middle temporal gyrus; neuro-current response function; normal human; primary motor cortex; priority journal; right hemisphere; simulation; superior temporal sulcus; temporal response function; young adult; brain cortex; female; functional neuroimaging; magnetoencephalography; male; physiology; procedures; speech perception; Adult; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Speech Perception; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079869716

The expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated by the transporter substrate. In E. coli, such systems include for example the lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a regulatory feedback loop via membrane transport (positive feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic “on-off” switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane transporter through its substrate. © 2020 Laxhuber et al.

As VRET continues to demonstrate efficacy in treating PTSD across multiple trauma types and anxiety disorders, adapting existing systems and content to new domains while simultaneously maintaining clinical integrity is becoming a high priority. To develop BRAVEMIND-MST we engaged in an iterative participatory design process with psychologists, engineers, and artists. This first-person account of our collaborative development process focuses on three key areas (1) VR Environment, (2) User-Avatar State, and (3) Events, while detailing the challenges we encountered and lessons learned.

Autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs), which are designed to use multiple vehicles to transfer materials, are widely used to transfer wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. Traffic control is a significant challenge with AVSs because all vehicles must be monitored and controlled in real time, to cope with uncertainties such as congestion. However, existing traffic control systems, which are primarily designed and controlled by human experts, are insufficient to prevent heavy congestion that impedes production. In this study, we developed a traffic control system based on machine learning predictions, and a routing method that dynamically determines AVS routes with reduced congestion rates. We predicted congestion for critical bottleneck areas, and utilized the predictions for adaptive routing control of all vehicles to avoid congestion. We conducted an experimental evaluation to compare the predictive performance of four popular algorithms. We performed a simulation study based on data from semiconductor fabrication to demonstrate the utility and superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that AVSs with the proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of delivery time, transfer time, and queuing time. We found that adopting machine learning-based traffic control can enhance the performance of existing AVSs and reduce the burden on the human experts who monitor and control AVSs. © 2019","Autonomous vehicle systems; Intelligent traffic control; Machine learning; Material handling; Vehicle routing","Automobile manufacture; Autonomous vehicles; Control systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Man machine systems; Materials handling; Semiconductor device manufacture; Street traffic control; Vehicle routing; Experimental evaluation; Intelligent traffic controls; Material handling; Monitor and control; Predictive performance; Semi-conductor fabrication; Semiconductor manufacturing; Simulation studies; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074763833

It is hypothesized that these small fins could potentially affect propulsive performance. Here, we combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate the hydrodynamics of finlets in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) during steady swimming. High-speed videos were obtained to provide kinematic data on the in vivo motion of finlets. High-fidelity simulations were then carried out to examine the hydrodynamic performance and vortex dynamics of a biologically realistic multiple-finlet model with reconstructed kinematics. It was found that finlets undergo both heaving and pitching motion and are delayed in phase from anterior to posterior along the body. Simulation results show that finlets were drag producing and did not produce thrust. The interactions among finlets helped reduce total finlet drag by 21.5%. Pitching motions of finlets helped reduce the power consumed by finlets during swimming by 20.8% compared with non-pitching finlets. Moreover, the pitching finlets created constructive forces to facilitate posterior body flapping. Wake dynamics analysis revealed a unique vortex tube matrix structure and cross-flow streams redirected by the pitching finlets, which supports their hydrodynamic function in scombrid fishes. Limitations on modelling and the generality of results are also discussed. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This study examines outcomes related to postpartum depression screening, receipt of evidence-based services, and reductions in depressive symptoms among clients of home visiting programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program Home Visiting Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (HV CoIIN), the first U.S. national application of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series (BTS) Model in home visiting programs. Methods and findings Fourteen home visiting programs in eight states, serving a geographically and racially diverse caseload of pregnant women and new mothers, took part in the HV CoIIN. Women in participating home visiting programs received the intervention strategies implemented by their program during participation in the collaborative. HV CoIIN strategies included specific policies and protocols for depression screening and home visitor response to screening results; home visitor training and supervision; delivery of prevention and treatment interventions; and tracking systems for screening, referral, and follow-up. HV CoIIN's proposed primary outcome was that 85% of women who accessed evidence-based services would experience a 25% reduction in depressive symptoms three months after accessing services. Secondary outcomes included an increased percentage of women who were screened for depression within three months of enrollment or birth, who verbally accepted a referral to evidence-based services, and who received one or more evidence-based service contacts. HV CoIIN resulted in improved symptoms among women who accessed services, from 51.1% to 59.9%. HV CoIIN also improved the percent of women screened for depression, from 83.6% to 96.3%, and those with positive depression screens who accessed evidence- based services, from 41.6% to 65.5%. Home visiting programs in this study were early adopters of quality improvement activities, which may limit the generalizability of these results to other home visiting programs. Conclusions Home visiting programs can play an important role in closing gaps in maternal depression identification, referrals, service access, and symptom alleviation. Continuous quality improvement and BTS collaborative methods can be used to improve home visiting services in ways that advance national public health priorities and improve population health outcomes. © 2020 Tandon et al.

However, many of the computational tools for strain design are built around Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), which makes assumptions that preclude direct integration of metabolomics data into the underlying models. Finding a way to retain the advantages of FBA's linear structure while relaxing some of its assumptions could allow us to account for metabolite levels and metabolite-dependent regulation in strain design tools built from FBA, improving the accuracy of predictions made by these tools. We designed, implemented, and characterized a modeling strategy based on Dynamic FBA (DFBA), called Linear Kinetics-Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (LK-DFBA), to satisfy these specifications. Our strategy adds constraints describing the dynamics and regulation of metabolism that are strictly linear. We evaluated LK-DFBA against alternative modeling frameworks using simulated noisy data from a small in silico model and a larger model of central carbon metabolism in E. coli, and compared each framework's ability to recapitulate the original system. Results: In the smaller model, we found that we could use regression from a dynamic flux estimation (DFE) with an optional non-linear parameter optimization to reproduce metabolite concentration dynamic trends more effectively than an ordinary differential equation model with generalized mass action rate laws when tested under realistic data sampling frequency and noise levels. We observed detrimental effects across all tested modeling approaches when metabolite time course data were missing, but found these effects to be smaller for LK-DFBA in most cases. With the E. coli model, we produced qualitatively reasonable results with similar properties to the smaller model and explored two different parameterization structures that yield trade-offs in computation time and accuracy. Conclusions: LK-DFBA allows for calculation of metabolite concentrations and considers metabolite-dependent regulation while still retaining many computational advantages of FBA. This provides the proof-of-principle for a new metabolic modeling framework with the potential to create genome-scale dynamic models and the potential to be applied in strain engineering tools that currently use FBA. © 2020 The Author(s).","Flux balance analysis; Metabolic modeling; Metabolite dynamics; Metabolomics","Biomolecules; Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Escherichia coli; Frequency estimation; Linear programming; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Ordinary differential equations; Central carbon metabolisms; Computational advantages; Flux balance analysis; Metabolic modeling; Metabolite concentrations; Metabolomics; Non-linear parameters; Ordinary differential equation models; Metabolites; article; calculation; carbon metabolism; computer model; kinetics; mass action; metabolomics; noise; simulation; system analysis; biological model; Escherichia coli; metabolism; metabolomics; Escherichia coli; Kinetics; Metabolomics; Models, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081030591

So far, the empirical evidence from previous studies has been limited and conflicting, and none of the studies have explored how learners' allocation of visual attention to the on-screen instructor influences learning and learner perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to disentangle a) how instructor presence in online videos affects learning, learner perceptions (i.e., cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, situational interest), and visual attention distribution and b) to what extent visual attention patterns in instructor-present videos predict learning and learner perceptions. Sixty college students each watched two videos on Statistics, one on an easy topic and the other one on a difficult topic, with each in one of the two video formats: instructor-present or instructor-absent. Their eye movements were simultaneously registered using a desktop-mounted eye tracker. Afterwards, participants self-reported their cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, and situational interest for both videos, and feelings toward seeing the instructor for the instructor-present videos. Learning from the two videos was measured using retention and transfer questions. Findings indicated instructor presence a) improved transfer performance for the difficult topic, b) reduced cognitive load for the difficult topic, c) increased judgment of learning for the difficult topic, and d) enhanced satisfaction and situational interest for both topics. Most participants expressed a positive feeling toward the instructor. Results also showed the instructor attracted a considerable amount of overt visual attention in both videos, and the amount of attention allocated to the instructor positively predicted participants’ satisfaction level for both topics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Behavioral research; Eye movements; Eye tracking; Students; College students; Eye-tracking analysis; Instructional videos; Learner perceptions; Overt visual attentions; Positive feelings; Transfer performance; Visual Attention; E-learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076034624

However, GWAS techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWAS method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results: In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach. GenEpi identifies both within-gene and cross-gene epistasis through a two-stage modeling workflow. In both stages, GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. The simulated data showed that GenEpi outperforms other widely-used methods on detecting the ground-Truth epistasis. As real data is concerned, this study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power. Conclusions: The results on simulation data and AD demonstrated that GenEpi has the ability to detect the epistasis associated with phenotypes effectively and efficiently. The released package can be generalized to largely facilitate the studies of many complex diseases in the near future. © 2020 The Author(s).","Epistasis; GWAS; Machine learning","Genes; Learning systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Computational package; Epistasis; Genome-wide association studies; GWAS; Machine learning approaches; Predictive power; Stability selections; Machine learning; epistasis; genome-wide association study; human; machine learning; phenotype; software; Epistasis, Genetic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080878747

Animal models have demonstrated the importance of spatial context representations within the hippocampal formation in contextualization of fear learning. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to play an important role in safety learning, possibly also through the incorporation of context information. However, if contextual representations are related to context-dependent expression of fear memory in humans remains unclear. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent functional MRI combined with a cue-context conditioning paradigm within a self-navigated virtual reality environment. The environment included two buildings (Threat and Safe context), which had distinct features outside but were identical inside. Within each context, participants saw two cues (CS+, CS-). The CS+ was consistently (100% reinforcement rate) paired with an electric shock in the Threat context, but never in the Safe context. The CS- was never paired with a shock. We found robust differential skin conductance responses (SCRs; CS+ ​> ​CS-) in the Threat context, but also within the Safe context, indicating fear generalization. Within the Safe context, vmPFC responses to the CS+ were larger than those in the Threat context. We furthermore found environment-specific representations for the two contexts in the training paradigm (i.e., before conditioning took place) in the hippocampus to be related to fear expression and generalization. Namely, participants with a weak context representation (z-score < 1.65) showed stronger fear generalization compared to participants with a strong context representation (z-score > 1.65). Thus, a weak neural representation strength of spatial context may explain overgeneralization of memory to safe contexts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that context-dependent regulation of fear expression engages ventromedial prefrontal pathways suggesting this involves a similar mechanism that is known to be involved in retrieval of extinction memory. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","BOLD-fMRI; Contextual conditioning; Hippocampus; Pavlovian fear conditioning; Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC); Virtual reality","adult; Article; association; biosafety; brain function; concept formation; conditioning; controlled study; electric shock; environmental factor; fear; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hippocampus; human; human experiment; life threat; male; normal human; priority journal; recall; regulatory mechanism; reinforcement; skin conductance; spatial memory; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; virtual reality; conditioned reflex; depth perception; electrodermal response; fear; functional neuroimaging; hippocampus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; prefrontal cortex; spatial behavior; support vector machine; young adult; Adult; Conditioning, Classical; Fear; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Galvanic Skin Response; Generalization, Psychological; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prefrontal Cortex; Space Perception; Spatial Behavior; Support Vector Machine; Virtual Reality; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075509808

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are significant targets for methyl-based modifications, which are catalyzed by tRNA methyltransferases (Trms). Here, Saccharomyces cerevisiae served as a model eukaryote system to investigate the role of 2'-O-ribose tRNA methylation in the cell's response to oxidative stress. Using 2'-O-ribose deletion mutants for trms 3, 7, 13, and 44, in acute and chronic exposure settings, we demonstrate a broad cell sensitivity to oxidative stress-inducing toxicants (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, rotenone, and acetic acid). A global analysis of hydrogen peroxide-induced tRNA modifications shows a complex profile of decreased, or undetectable, 2'-O-ribose modification events in 2'-O-ribose trm mutant strains, providing a critical link between this type of modification event and Trm status post-exposure. Based on the pronounced oxidative stress sensitivity observed for trm7 mutants, we used a bioinformatic tool to identify transcripts as candidates for regulation by Trm7-catalyzed modifications (i.e., enriched in UUC codons decoded by tRNAPheGmAA). This screen identified transcripts linked to diverse biological processes that promote cellular recovery after oxidative stress exposure, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and nutrient acquisition (i.e., CRT10, HIR3, HXT2, and GNP1); moreover, these mutants were also oxidative stress-sensitive. Together, these results solidify a role for TRM3, 7, 13, and 44, in the cellular response to oxidative stress, and implicate 2'-O-ribose tRNA modification as an epitranscriptomic strategy for oxidative stress recovery. © 2020 Endres et al.

DHRT training greatly reduces preceptor time by providing automated feedback, standardizes learning experiences, and quantifies skill improvements. Methods: Expert observers evaluated DHRT-trained (N = 21) and manikin-trained (N = 36) surgical residents on US-IJCVC placement in the operating suite using a US-IJCVC evaluation form. Performance and errors by DHRT-trained residents were compared to traditional manikin-trained residents. Results: There were no significant training group differences between unsuccessful insertions (p = 0.404), assistance on procedure (p = 0.102), arterial puncture (p = 0.998), and average number of insertion attempts (p = 0.878). Regardless of training group, previous central line experience significantly predicted whether residents needed assistance on the procedure (p = 0.033).

Causal influences in the brain, quantified as integrated information, are thought to support subjective conscious experience. Recent empirical work has shown that the spectral decomposition of causal influences, for example using Granger causality, can reveal frequency-specific influences that are not observed in the time domain. However, a spectral decomposition of integrated information has not been put forward, limiting its adoption for analyzing neural data. New method: We present a general and flexible framework for deriving the spectral decomposition of causal influences in autoregressive processes. Results: We use the framework to derive a spectral decomposition of integrated information. We show that other well-known measures, including Granger causality, can be derived using the same framework. Using simulations, we demonstrate a complex interplay between the spectral decomposition of integrated information and other measures that is not observed in the time domain. Comparison with existing methods: This paper provides a spectral decomposition of integrated information for the first time. Although a spectral decomposition of Granger causality has been derived, that approach is only applicable to uni-directional causal influences, not multi-directional causal influences as required for integrated information. Conclusions: Our novel framework can be used to derive the spectral decomposition of uni- and multi-directional measures of causal influences. We use this framework to derive a spectral decomposition of integrated information, paving the way for better understanding how frequency-specific causal influences in the brain relate to cognition. © 2019 The Authors","Coherence; Granger causality; Integrated information; Integrated information theory; Spectral decomposition; Transfer entropy","adoption; article; brain; cognition; decomposition; entropy; human; human experiment; information science; intermethod comparison; simulation; entropy; information science; neuroimaging; procedures; theoretical model; Entropy; Humans; Information Theory; Models, Theoretical; Neuroimaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075433965

For example, substantial progress has been achieved in creating biodegradable, self-healing, or breathable, on-skin electronics. However, the research of making on-skin electronics with passive-cooling capabilities, which can reduce energy consumption and improve user comfort, is still rare. Herein, we report the development of multifunctional on-skin electronics, which can passively cool human bodies without needing any energy consumption. This property is inherited from multiscale porous polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) supporting substrates. The multiscale pores of SEBS substrates, with characteristic sizes ranging from around 0.2 to 7 μm, can effectively backscatter sunlight to minimize heat absorption but are too small to reflect human-body midinfrared radiation to retain heat dissipation, thereby delivering around 6 °C cooling effects under a solar intensity of 840 W·m−2. Other desired properties, rooted in multiscale porous SEBS substrates, include high breathability and outstanding waterproofing. The proof-of-concept bioelectronic devices include electrophysiological sensors, temperature sensors, hydration sensors, pressure sensors, and electrical stimulators, which are made via spray printing of silver nanowires on multiscale porous SEBS substrates. The devices show comparable electrical performances with conventional, rigid, nonporous ones. Also, their applications in cuffless blood pressure measurement, interactive virtual reality, and human–machine interface are demonstrated. Notably, the enabled on-skin devices are dissolvable in several organic solvents and can be recycled to reduce electronic waste and manufacturing cost. Such on-skin electronics can serve as the basis for future multifunctional smart textiles with passive-cooling functionalities. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Background: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of whether or not these manipulations are effective for training has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered. Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their efficacy as training tools has been debated. Method: The current body of literature was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors, trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on performance measures after XR-based training. Results: Results showed that training in XR does not express a different outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance. Conclusion: Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods, such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional training impossible. © Copyright 2020, Commonwealth of Australia, as represented by the Department of Defence, Science, and Technology.","immersive environments; meta-analysis; transfer of training; virtual environments","Augmented reality; Mixed reality; Virtual reality; Control environment; Empirical findings; Immersive environment; Meta analysis; Performance measure; Training enhancement; Training methods; Transfer of trainings; E-learning; article; augmented reality; effect size; human; meta analysis; transfer of learning; virtual reality",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081603757

Simulations provide opportunities for authentic practice in a controlled environment with reduced risk of harm. This instrumental case study examines the experiences of 13 pre-service teachers who participated in a session with the mixed reality simulation Mursion®, which emerged from TLE TeachLivE™, while enrolled in at least one teacher education course with a field experience. The researchers analyzed interview data with a variety of coding techniques and then drew assertions from codes and derivative themes. From data analysis, four themes emerged: opportunity for authentic practice, perceived transfer of learning, perceived confidence, and challenges of using the mixed reality simulation. The researchers drew the following conclusions from these themes. Participants considered the mixed reality simulation a more authentic form of practice than what their observations during field experiences afforded. Participants perceived transfer of learning from observations of peers during sessions with the mixed reality simulation to performance during their own sessions. Some participants perceived increased confidence in applying skills practiced during the simulation to work with live students and parents. Using the mixed reality simulation posed challenges including suspension of disbelief, meeting candidates' needs, and the presence of a peer audience. This study has implications for future use of mixed reality simulations for teacher preparation. © 2019","Mixed reality simulations; Mursion®; Pre-service teachers; Teacher education; TLE TeachLivE™","Students; Teaching; Coding techniques; Controlled environment; Implications for futures; Pre-service teacher; Teacher education; Teacher preparation; Teaching methods; Transfer of learning; Mixed reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072530080

It has been proposed that training in visual-spatial discordant situations can improve performance in the forward alignment, which was the basis of our hypothesis. Our study’s aim was to conduct a randomized control trial to explore the impact of simulated training in visual-spatial discordant situations on forward alignment performance. Methods: The participants were 80 medical students who were randomized into four groups. Group A served as the control and performed all peg transfers in the forward alignment. Groups B, C, and D experienced varied rounds of either increasing or decreasing sensorimotor discordance. The students were trained and tested using the peg transfer task used in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery curriculum. Based on the group, each student performed 10 peg transfer practice rounds in their assigned alignment. After each practice session, each student was tested and scored in forward alignment performance. A baseline test, followed by three practice sessions, and three tests were done. Results: Group A (control) demonstrated a statistically significant overall increase in scoring of 37.1% from baseline when compared to the final test. Groups B, C, and D showed improvements of 3.7%, 27.1%, and 19.3%, respectively, between baseline and the final test, yet none demonstrated consistent linear improvements. On multi-variate analysis, students who practiced in the side or reverse alignment positions scored 25 and 37 points lower, respectively, than students who practiced in the forward alignment. Conclusion: Our study suggests that training in visual-spatial discordant conditions does not lead to the development of forward alignment laparoscopic skills. This could have important implications when developing future laparoscopic skills training curriculums. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date assessing the impacts of training in visual-spatial discordance situations on performance in the forward alignment. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Education; Laparoscopic skills; Laparoscopic training practice; Training; Visual motor coordination; Visual-spatial discordant","adult; article; controlled study; curriculum; female; human; human experiment; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; medical student; randomized controlled trial; simulation; skill; visuomotor coordination; clinical competence; computer simulation; curriculum; depth perception; education; laparoscopy; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; simulation training; teaching; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Simulation Training; Space Perception; Students, Medical; Teaching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064503976

Fast saturation transfer method (T1 nom T1 nominal) to measure CK reaction rate constant (kf) was previously demonstrated in open chest swine hearts. The goal of this work is to further develop this method for measuring the kf in human myocardium at 7T. T1 nom approach is combined with 1D-ISIS/2D-CSI for in vivo spatial localization and myocardial CK forward rate constant was then measured in 7 volunteers at 7T. Methods T1 nom method uses two partially relaxed saturation transfer (ST) spectra and correction factor to determine CK rate constant. Correction factor is determined by numerical simulation of Bloch McConnell equations using known spin and experimental parameters. Optimal parameters and error estimate in calculation of CK reaction rate constant were determined by simulations. The technique was validated in calf muscles by direct comparison with saturation transfer measurements. T1 nom pulse sequence was incorporated with 1D-image selected in vivo spectroscopy, combined with 2D-chemical shift spectroscopic imaging (1D-ISIS/2D-CSI) for studies in heart. The myocardial CK reaction rate constant was then measured in 7 volunteers. Results Skeletal muscle kf determined by conventional approach and T1 nom approach were the same 0.31 ± 0.02 s-1 and 0.30 ± 0.04 s-1 demonstrating the validity of the technique. Results are reported as mean ± SD. Myocardial CK reaction rate constant was 0.29 ± 0.05 s-1, consistent with previously reported studies. Conclusion T1 nom method enables acquisition of 31P saturation transfer MRS under partially relaxed conditions and enables 2D-CSI of kf in myocardium. This work enables applications for in vivo CSI imaging of energetics in heart and other organs in clinically relevant acquisition time. Copyright: © 2020 Bashir et al.

Service system improvements require stakeholder input from across the care continuum to identify gaps and to inform strategic plans that improve HIV service integration and delivery. System dynamics modeling offers a participatory research approach through which stakeholders learn about system complexity and about ways to achieve sustainable system-level improvements. Via an intensive group model building process with a task force of community stakeholders with diverse roles and responsibilities for HIV service implementation, delivery and surveillance, we designed and validated a multi-module system dynamics model of the HIV care continuum, in relation to local prevention and care service capacities. Multiple sources of data were used to calibrate the model for a three-county catchment area of central Connecticut. We feature a core module of the model for the purpose of illustrating its utility in understanding the dynamics of treatment as prevention at the community level. We also describe the methods used to validate the model and support its underlying assumptions to improve confidence in its use by stakeholders for systems understanding and decision making. The model's generalizability and implications of using it for future community-driven strategic planning and implementation efforts are discussed. © 2020 Weeks et al.

Participants demonstrated learning as evidenced by rapid increases in accuracy and consistency in the production of trained targets. This learning generalized to productions of novel vowel targets. Subsequent to learning, sensorimotor adaptation was observed in response to changes in the location-sound mapping.

The vast majority of this literature is based on analyses of gaze patterns as participants view social information, such as talking faces, on a computer screen. However, recent results suggest that generalizing gaze behaviors from computer screens to live interactions may not be valid. This study examines between- and within-group differences in gaze behaviors of children with ASD and their neurotypical (NT) peers during a screen-based and a live-interaction task. Results show between-group differences in gaze only for the screen-based, but not the live-interaction task. We also find that gaze behavior of NT children during the screen-based task significantly correlates with their gaze behavior during the live interaction; individuals who direct a higher percentage of gaze to the face in one task also did so in the other task. However, there is no significant relationship between the gaze patterns of children with ASD for those two tasks. These results strongly caution against using gaze of individuals with ASD recorded during screen-based tasks as a proxy for understanding their gaze behavior during live social interactions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adolescent; autism; child; eye fixation; face; female; human; human relation; male; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Face; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Photic Stimulation; Screen Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071775653

Here, we examine how visual information affects the generalization of dynamic learning during tool use. Subjects rotated a virtual hammer-like object while we varied the object dynamics separately for two rotational directions. This allowed us to quantify the coupling of adaptation between the directions, that is, how adaptation transferred from one direction to the other. Two groups experienced the same dynamics of the object. For one group, the object’s visual configuration was displayed, while for the other, the visual display was uninformative as to the dynamics. We fit a range of context-dependent state-space models to the data, comparing different forms of coupling. We found that when the object’s visual configuration was explicitly provided, there was substantial coupling, such that 31% of learning in one direction transferred to the other. In contrast, when the visual configuration was ambiguous, despite experiencing the same dynamics, the coupling was reduced to 12%. Our results suggest that generalization of dynamic learning of a tool relies, not only on its dynamic behaviour, but also on the visual configuration with which the dynamics is associated. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; geometry; human; learning; tool use; visual information; algorithm; biomechanics; learning; robotics; virtual reality; vision; Algorithms; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Learning; Robotics; Virtual Reality; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062075715

Manual gait training was used as an exemplary case, as it requires therapists to control the non-trivial locomotor dynamics of patients. A virtual analog was developed that allowed naïve subjects to manipulate the leg of a virtual stroke survivor (a virtual patient; VP) walking on a treadmill using a small robotic manipulandum. The task was to make the VP’s leg pass through early, mid, and late swing gait targets. One group of subjects (n = 17) started practice seeing the VP’s affected thigh and shank (i.e., VDCs); a second control group (n = 16) only saw the point-of-contact (VP ankle). It was hypothesized that, if seeing the VP’s leg provides beneficial dynamics information, the VDC group would have better task performance and generalization than controls. Results were not supportive.

This suggests that when learning to manipulate complex dynamics, VDCs can create a dependency that negatively affects generalization if the visual context is changed. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"adult; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; female; gait; human; learning; male; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial; virtual reality exposure therapy; vision; Adult; Female; Gait; Humans; Learning; Male; Stroke; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; Vision, Ocular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072383848

Does the brain achieve this understanding by running simulations in a mental physics engine, which represents variables such as force and mass, or by analyzing patterns of motion without encoding underlying physical quantities? To investigate, we scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed videos of objects interacting in scenarios indicating their mass. Decoding analyses in brain regions previously implicated in intuitive physical inference revealed mass representations that generalized across variations in scenario, material, friction, and motion energy. These invariant representations were found during tasks without action planning, and tasks focusing on an orthogonal dimension (object color).

Embryogenesis and regeneration require plasticity in many tissue types to achieve structural and functional goals in diverse circumstances. Thus, advances in both evolutionary cell biology and regenerative medicine require an understanding of how non-neural tissues could process information. Neurons evolved from ancient cell types that used bioelectric signaling to perform computation. However, it has not been shown whether or how non-neural bioelectric cell networks can support computation. We generalize connectionist methods to non-neural tissue architectures, showing that a minimal non-neural Bio-Electric Network (BEN) model that utilizes the general principles of bioelectricity (electrodiffusion and gating) can compute. We characterize BEN behaviors ranging from elementary logic gates to pattern detectors, using both fixed and transient inputs to recapitulate various biological scenarios. We characterize the mechanisms of such networks using dynamical-systems and information-theory tools, demonstrating that logic can manifest in bidirectional, continuous, and relatively slow bioelectrical systems, complementing conventional neural-centric architectures. Our results reveal a variety of non-neural decision-making processes as manifestations of general cellular biophysical mechanisms and suggest novel bioengineering approaches to construct functional tissues for regenerative medicine and synthetic biology as well as new machine learning architectures. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; bioenergy; bioengineering; decision making; diffusion; human; human experiment; information science; machine learning; nerve cell; regenerative medicine; signal transduction; synthetic biology; algorithm; animal; automated pattern recognition; biological model; biology; biomedical engineering; body patterning; computer language; computer simulation; developmental biology; electrophysiology; embryology; procedures; regeneration; Turbellaria; Algorithms; Animals; Bioengineering; Biomedical Engineering; Body Patterning; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Developmental Biology; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Models, Biological; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Planarians; Programming Languages; Regeneration; Regenerative Medicine; Signal Transduction; Synthetic Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076370929

Design: Participants completed a survey regarding prior surgery exposure and other confounding factors including previous video game experience and self-assessed hand-eye coordination. Following orientation to the laparoscopic simulator (LS) and robotic surgical simulator (RoSS), participants were timed performing the Balloon Grasp and Ball Drop tasks on the RoSS and the Peg Transfer and Ball Drop tasks on the LS. Participants were then randomized to either the laparoscopic or RoSS arm and timed performing the Ball Drop task 10 times and then reassessed performing the Ball Drop using the unpracticed modality. Setting: Clinical Simulation Laboratory at the University of Vermont Participants: A total of 31 medical students with limited experience in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the demographics or prior surgical and videogame experience between the participants in the laparoscopic and robotic arms of the study (X2 = 0.72, p = 0.75). Timed initial assessment of the RoSS Balloon Grasp (p = 0.84) and Ball Drop (p = 0.79) tasks and the LS Peg Transfer (p = 0.14) and Ball Drop (p = 0.44) tasks were not statistically different between the 2 arms. The simulator modality which was practiced yielded the greatest improvement. The degree of improvement on the unpracticed modality was not statistically different between the groups (p = 0.57), and it was not significantly better than 2 rounds of sequential practice on the practiced modality (LS, p = 0.98 and RoSS, p = 0.55). Conclusions: With practice, both groups increased surgical skill on the unpracticed modality.

Existing solutions for optical coherence microscopy (OCM) suffer from either large data size and long acquisition time or a nonideal point spread function. We present volumetric OCM of mouse brain ex vivo with a large depth coverage by leveraging computational adaptive optics (CAO) to significantly reduce the number of OCM volumes that need to be acquired with a Gaussian beam focused at different depths. We demonstrate volumetric reconstruction of ex-vivo mouse brain with lateral resolution of 2.2 μm, axial resolution of 4.7 μm, and depth range of 1/41.2 mm optical path length, using only 11 OCT data volumes acquired on a spectral-domain OCM system. Compared to focus scanning with step size equal to the Rayleigh length of the beam, this is a factor of 4 fewer datasets required for volumetric imaging. Coregistered two-photon microscopy confirmed that CAO-OCM reconstructions can visualize various tissue microstructures in the brain. Our results also highlight the limitations of CAO in highly scattering media, particularly when attempting to reconstruct far from the focal plane or when imaging deep within the sample. © The Authors.

Secondary objectives include exploring the relationship between actual and perceived aptitude, and identifying predictors of superior aptitude. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, multisite study in which participants completed a paper survey, four visuospatial aptitude assessments, and a laparoscopic simulation modeled after the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) peg transfer test (used as a proxy for psychomotor aptitude). SETTING: Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Mayo Clinic School of Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: All second-year medical students who had not yet initiated clinical rotations were eligible. Sixty-four students participated. RESULTS: Students interested in a procedural career exhibited superior psychomotor aptitude (faster FLS task completion time), and a majority of these students correctly identified themselves as having above-average aptitude compared with peers. However, over one quarter of all students, regardless of career interest, incorrectly over- or under-rated their psychomotor aptitude. Upon completing their preclinical curriculum, a minority of students felt prepared to participate or assist in their surgical clinical rotations. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to embarking on their clinical rotations, over one quarter of medical students lack awareness of their psychomotor aptitude and many do not feel prepared to participate in the next phase of their training.

Integrated states are prevalent when performing tasks of high complexity, such as maintaining items in working memory, consistent with models of a global workspace architecture. Recent work has suggested that the balance between integration and segregation is under the control of ascending neuromodulatory systems, such as the noradrenergic system, via changes in neural gain (in terms of the amplification and non-linearity in stimulus-response transfer function of brain regions). In a previous large-scale nonlinear oscillator model of neuronal network dynamics, we showed that manipulating neural gain parameters led to a 'critical' transition in phase synchrony that was associated with a shift from segregated to integrated topology, thus confirming our original prediction. In this study, we advance these results by demonstrating that the gain-mediated phase transition is characterized by a shift in the underlying dynamics of neural information processing. Specifically, the dynamics of the subcritical (segregated) regime are dominated by information storage, whereas the supercritical (integrated) regime is associated with increased information transfer (measured via transfer entropy). Operating near to the critical regime with respect to modulating neural gain parameters would thus appear to provide computational advantages, offering flexibility in the information processing that can be performed with only subtle changes in gain control. Our results thus link studies of whole-brain network topology and the ascending arousal system with information processing dynamics, and suggest that the constraints imposed by the ascending arousal system constrain low-dimensional modes of information processing within the brain.",,"biological model; brain; brain mapping; cognition; computer simulation; human; mental function; nerve cell; nerve cell network; nerve tract; nonlinear system; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; short term memory; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Computer Simulation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory, Short-Term; Mental Processes; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073409480

Yet, despite 2 decades of debates, the key question of how the spin angular momentum flows on the femtosecond timescale remains open. The lack of direct first-principle methods and pictures for such process exacerbates the issue. Here, we unravel the laser-induced demagnetization mechanism of ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAs, using an efficient time-dependent density functional theory approach that enables the direct real-time snapshot of the demagnetization process. Our results show a clear spin-transfer trajectory from the localized Mn-d electrons to itinerant carriers within 20 fs, illustrating the dominant role of spuid interaction. We find that the total spin of localized electrons and itinerant carriers is not conserved in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Immediately after laser excitation, a growing percentage of spin-angular momentum is quickly transferred to the electron orbital via SOC in about 1 ps, then slowly to the lattice via electron-phonon coupling in a few picoseconds, responsible for the 2-stage process observed experimentally. The spin-relaxation time via SOC is about 300 fs for itinerant carriers and about 700 fs for Mn-d electrons. These results provide a quantum-mechanical microscopic picture for the long-standing questions regarding the channels and timescales of spin transfer, as well as the roles of different interactions underlying the GaMnAs demagnetization process. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Background: Prior research on procedural work that directly compared augmented reality instructions to traditional instruction methods (e.g., paper) showed that augmented reality instructions can enhance procedural work, but this was not true for simple tasks in an operational setting. Method: Participants completed simple procedural tasks on spaceflight hardware using an augmented reality instruction method and a paper instruction method. Results: Our results showed that the augmented reality instruction method resulted in faster task completion times and lower levels of mental and temporal demand compared with paper instructions. When participants used the augmented reality instruction method before the paper instruction method, there was a transfer of training that improved a subsequent procedure using the paper instruction method.

Design: A quasi-experimental, pre-/postintervention comparison design examined high fidelity SBT of inter-professional teams using a 2 scenario format with immediate after action structured debriefing. Pre-/postsession Readiness for Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS, 19 items, Likert-type) surveys as well as Interprofessional Teamwork (IPT, 15 items, Likert-type) questionnaires, and postscenario participant- and observer-rated Teamwork Assessment Scales (TAS, 3 subscales, 11 items, Likert-type) were completed during each training session. Mean RIPLS, IPT, and TAS scores were calculated and matched pre-/postscore differences compared using paired t-test or analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment. Setting: A large, urban, academic, state health sciences institution in the Southeastern United States during the 2014 to 2015 academic year. Participants: General surgery residents, emergency medicine residents, and senior undergraduate nursing students comprising ten interprofessional teams. Results: From approximately 48 participants, matched pre-/postsession IPT surveys were available for 42 individuals; 45 had an observer TAS evaluation for both scenarios; and 40 completed TAS peer evaluations for both scenarios. 47 participants had matched RIPLS surveys. Statistically significant improvements in matched pre-/postscore differences occurred for all 15 IPT items. Observer TAS scores significantly improved on 2 of the 3 subscales comparing the second to the first scenario. Peer evaluations statistically improved comparing the second to the first scenario. Two of the 19 RIPLS items demonstrated statistically significant improvement. Conclusions: Interprofessional trauma team transfer training using SBT changes attitudes toward key team-based competencies and leads to learning them in the simulated environment. Such improvement in team-based skill and attitudes is an important first step in adopting team-based behaviors in the actual clinical environment and improving transfer care. © 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Interprofessional; Simulation; Surgical education; Teamwork; Transitions in care; Trauma","Article; comparative study; critically ill patient; emergency medicine; emergency ward; general surgery; high fidelity simulation training; human; injury; nursing student; priority journal; resident; simulation training; teamwork; traumatology; education; health personnel attitude; high fidelity simulation training; hospital emergency service; nursing education; patient care; patient transport; Attitude of Health Personnel; Education, Nursing; Emergency Medicine; Emergency Service, Hospital; General Surgery; High Fidelity Simulation Training; Patient Care Team; Patient Transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064255084

As researchers develop increasingly sophisticated tools to model statistical dependence between the fMRI signal in different brain regions, there is a risk that these models may increasingly capture artifactual relationships between regions, that are the result of noise. Thus, choosing optimal denoising methods is a crucial step to maximize the accuracy and reproducibility of connectivity models. Most comparisons between denoising methods require knowledge of the ground truth: of what is the 'real signal'. For this reason, they are usually based on simulated fMRI data. However, simulated data may not match the statistical properties of real data, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. In this article, we propose an approach to evaluate denoising methods using real (non-simulated) fMRI data. First, we introduce an intersubject version of multivariate pattern dependence (iMVPD) that computes the statistical dependence between a brain region in one participant, and another brain region in a different participant. iMVPD has the following advantages: 1) it is multivariate, 2) it trains and tests models on independent partitions of the real fMRI data, and 3) it generates predictions that are both between subjects and between regions. Since whole-brain sources of noise are more strongly correlated within subject than between subjects, we can use the difference between standard MVPD and iMVPD as a 'discrepancy metric' to evaluate denoising techniques (where more effective techniques should yield smaller differences). As predicted, the difference is the greatest in the absence of denoising methods. Furthermore, a combination of removal of the global signal and CompCorr optimizes denoising (among the set of denoising options tested). © 2019 Li et al.",,"adult; article; brain region; controlled study; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; intermethod comparison; noise; prediction; reproducibility; simulation; algorithm; artifact; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; female; image processing; information processing; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; statistical model; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Brain Mapping; Datasets as Topic; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072602559

However, metrics such as completion time or subjective performance checklists often show poor correlation to transfer of skills into clinical settings. We hypothesize that non-invasive brain imaging can objectively differentiate and classify surgical skill transfer, with higher accuracy than established metrics, for subjects based on motor skill levels. Study design: 18 medical students at University at Buffalo were randomly assigned into control, physical surgical trainer, or virtual trainer groups. Training groups practiced a surgical technical task on respective simulators for 12 consecutive days. To measure skill transfer post-training, all subjects performed the technical task in an ex-vivo environment. Cortical activation was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area, due to their direct impact on motor skill learning. Results: Classification between simulator trained and untrained subjects based on traditional metrics is poor, where misclassification errors range from 20 to 41%. Conversely, fNIRS metrics can successfully classify physical or virtual trained subjects from untrained subjects with misclassification errors of 2.2% and 8.9%, respectively. More importantly, untrained subjects are successfully classified from physical or virtual simulator trained subjects with misclassification errors of 2.7% and 9.1%, respectively. Conclusion: fNIRS metrics are significantly more accurate than current established metrics in classifying different levels of surgical motor skill transfer. Our approach brings robustness, objectivity, and accuracy in validating the effectiveness of future surgical trainers in translating surgical skills to clinically relevant environments. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Brain imaging; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy; Surgical simulators; Surgical skill assessment; Surgical skill transfer; Surgical training","Article; artifact; brain; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; functional neuroimaging; human; laparoscopic surgery; medical student; Monte Carlo method; motor performance; prefrontal cortex; primary motor cortex; priority journal; supplementary motor area; surgical training; task performance; adult; brain; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; education; female; learning; male; medical education; medical student; neuroimaging; neurosurgery; procedures; randomized controlled trial; Adult; Brain; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Neuroimaging; Neurosurgery; Students, Medical; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055552476

To circumvent the difficulty, a prevalent viewpoint simplifies the neuronal morphology as a point representing the soma, and the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents originated from the dendrites are treated as linearly summed at the soma. Despite its extensive applications, the validity of the synaptic current description remains unclear, and the existing point neuron framework fails to characterize the spatiotemporal aspects of dendritic integration supporting specific computations. Using electrophysiological experiments, realistic neuronal simulations, and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that the traditional assumption of linear summation of synaptic currents is oversimplified and underestimates the inhibition effect. We then derive a form of synaptic integration current within the point neuron framework to capture dendritic effects. In the derived form, the interaction between each pair of synaptic inputs on the dendrites can be reliably parameterized by a single coefficient, suggesting the inherent low-dimensional structure of dendritic integration. We further generalize the form of synaptic integration current to capture the spatiotemporal interactions among multiple synaptic inputs and show that a point neuron model with the synaptic integration current incorporated possesses the computational ability of a spatial neuron with dendrites, including direction selectivity, coincidence detection, logical operation, and a bilinear dendritic integration rule discovered in experiment. Our work amends the modeling of synaptic inputs and improves the computational power of a modeling neuron within the point neuron framework. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

While traditional segmentation algorithms underperform due to variations in image quality and shape of the breast region, newer methods from machine learning cannot be readily applied as they need a large training dataset with segmented images. In this paper, we propose to overcome these limitations by combining clustering with deformable image registration. Using clustering, we first identify a set of atlas images that best capture the variation in mammograms. This is done using a clustering algorithm where the number of clusters is determined using model selection on a low-dimensional projection of the images. Then, we use these atlas images to transfer the segmentation to similar images using deformable image registration algorithm. Our technique also overcomes the limitation of very few landmarks for registration in breast images. We evaluated our method on the mini-MIAS and DDSM datasets against three existing state-of-the-art algorithms using two performance metrics, Jaccard Index and Hausdorff Distance. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is indeed capable of identifying different types of mammograms in the dataset and segmenting them accurately. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atlas based image registration; Atlas selection; Breast region segmentation; Clustering; Mammograms","Calcification (biochemistry); Deformation; Image registration; Image segmentation; Large dataset; Machine learning; Mammography; Medical imaging; X ray screens; Atlas selection; Clustering; Deformable image registration; Deformable registration; Mammogram segmentations; Mammograms; Region segmentation; State-of-the-art algorithms; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; Article; breast tissue; controlled study; data analysis software; evaluation study; human; image quality; image segmentation; mammography; priority journal; registration; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; breast; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; factual database; female; Algorithms; Breast; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Mammography; Pattern Recognition, Automated",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067563526

Current modeling efforts are not able to explain clinical observations where drastic differences in sound production are often observed, with no noticeable differences in the vocal fold kinematics. To advance this understanding, an acoustical model for voiced sound generation in the presence of asymmetric intraglottal flows is developed. The source model operates in conjunction with a wave reflection analog propagation scheme and an asymmetric flow description within the glottis. To enable comparison with prior work, the source model is evaluated using a well-studied two-mass vocal fold model. The proposed source model is evaluated through acoustic measures of interest, including radiated sound pressure level, maximum flow declination rate, and spectral tilt, and also via its effects on the vocal fold dynamics. The influence of the model, in comparison to the standard symmetric Bernoulli flow description, results in an increased transfer of energy from the fluid to the vocal folds, increased radiated sound pressure level and maximum flow declination rate, and decreased spectral tilt. These differences are most pronounced for asymmetric vocal fold configurations that mimic unilateral paresis and paralysis, where minor kinematic changes can result in significant acoustic and aerodynamic differences. The results illustrate that fluid effects arising from asymmetric glottal flow can play an important role in the acoustics of pathological voiced speech.

Virtual simulators of these tasks have been developed and validated as part of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) (Arikatla et al. in Int J Med Robot Comput Assist Surg 10:344–355, 2014; Zhang et al. in Surg Endosc 27(10):3603–3615, 2013; Sankaranarayanan et al. in J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech 20(2):153–157, 2010; Qi et al. J Biomed Inform 75:48–62, 2017). The virtual task trainers have many advantages including automatic real-time objective scoring, reduced costs, and eliminating human proctors. In this paper, we extend VBLaST by adding two camera navigation system tasks: (a) pattern matching and (b) path tracing. Methods: A comprehensive camera navigation simulator with two virtual tasks, simplified and cheaper hardware interface (compared to the prior version of VBLaST), graphical user interface, and automated metrics has been designed and developed.

The landscape of jobs and work is changing rapidly, thanks to the emerging new technology and the advancement of knowledge in the scientific fields. This technological and scientific revolution presents an opportunity in the creation of new industries and occupations, enhanced productivity and quality of work life, and the potential for more people to participate in the workforce. But these come at risk and disadvantage of an increased cost of training as well as lack of proper training in a few industries. In this paper, we propose to build a vIIS framework - A Vocational Interactive Immersive Storytelling system that uses storytelling in an Interactive virtual environment to train and assess a worker a new skill. The major advantage of this vIIS system is that it provides constant feedback in an engaging immersive virtual reality environment and has better memory retention and recall of the trained task. For assessment, we intend to collect data such as task completion time, accuracy, error rate, qualitative feedback and also measure transfer learning. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Framework; Interaction; Training; Virtual reality","Job satisfaction; Personnel training; Framework; Immersive virtual reality; Interaction; Interactive virtual environments; Performance assessment; Qualitative feedback; Quality of work life; Scientific revolutions; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069223879

If, on the other hand, learned representations are policies, they may be specific to the task where learning takes place. Here, we test this by asking whether a learned spatial prior generalizes from a sensorimotor estimation task to a two-alternative-forced choice (2-Afc) perceptual comparison task. A model and simulation-based analysis revealed that while participants learn prior distribution in the sensorimotor estimation task, measured priors are consistently broader than sensorimotor priors in the 2-Afc task. That the prior does not fully generalize suggests that sensorimotor priors are more like policies than knowledge. In disagreement with standard Bayesian thought, the modality of the decision has a strong influence on the implied prior distributions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We do not know whether the brain represents abstract and generalizable knowledge or task-specific policies that map internal states to actions. We find that learning in a sensorimotor task does not generalize strongly to a perceptual task, suggesting that humans learned policies and did not truly acquire knowledge.

However, less attention has been given to psycholinguistic data and neurophysiological features recently found in cortical tissue. We focus on a context in which basic linguistic units-such as phonemes-are extracted and robustly classified by humans and other animals from complex acoustic streams in speech data. We are especially motivated by the fact that 8-month-old human infants can accomplish segmentation of words from fluent audio streams based exclusively on the statistical relationships between neighboring speech sounds without any kind of supervision. In this paper, we introduce a biologically inspired and fully unsupervised neurocomputational approach that incorporates key neurophysiological and anatomical cortical properties, including columnar organization, spontaneous micro-columnar formation, adaptation to contextual activations and Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) produced by means of partial N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) depolarization. Its feature abstraction capabilities show promising phonetic invariance and generalization attributes. Our model improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for monosyllabic, disyllabic and trisyllabic word classification tasks in the presence of environmental disturbances such as white noise, reverberation, and pitch and voice variations. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes potential self-organizing cortical principles achieving improvement without any kind of optimization guidance which could minimize hypothetical loss functions by means of-for example-backpropagation. Thus, our computational model outperforms multiresolution spectro-temporal auditory feature representations using only the statistical sequential structure immerse in the phonotactic rules of the input stream.

Non-native species are ubiquitous in ecological communities and integrated into many described ecological interaction networks, including mutualisms. By altering the fitness landscape and rewiring species interactions, such network invasion may carry important implications for ecosystem resistance and resilience under continued environmental change. Here, I hypothesize that the tendency of established non-native species to be generalists may make them more likely than natives to occupy central network roles and may link them to the resistance and resilience of the overall network. I use a quantitative research synthesis of 58 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks, along with extinction simulations, to examine the roles of known non-natives in networks. I show that non-native species in networks enhance network redundancy and may thereby bolster the ecological resistance or functional persistence of ecosystems in the face of disturbance. At the same time, non-natives are unlikely to partner with specialist natives, thus failing to support the resilience of native species assemblages. Non-natives significantly exceed natives in network centrality, normalized degree, and Pollination Service Index. Networks containing nonnatives exhibit lower connectance, more links on average, and higher generality and vulnerability than networks lacking non-natives. As environmental change progresses, specialists are particularly likely to be impacted, reducing species diversity in many communities and network types. This work implies that functional diversity may be retained but taxonomic diversity decline as non-native species become established in networks worldwide. © 2019 Clare E. Aslan.

This structural plasticity can destabilize information transfer in the nervous system. However, neural activity remains stable throughout life, implying that adaptive countermeasures exist that maintain neurotransmission within proper physiological ranges. Aberrant synaptic structure and function have been associated with a variety of neural diseases, including Fragile X syndrome, autism, and intellectual disability.Wehave screened 300 mutants in Drosophila larvae of both sexes for defects in synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction, identifying 12 mutants with severe reductions or enhancements in synaptic growth. Remarkably, electrophysiological recordings revealed that synaptic strength was unchanged in all but one of these mutants compared with WT. We used a combination of genetic, anatomical, and electrophysiological analyses to illuminate three mechanisms that stabilize synaptic strength despite major disparities in synaptic growth. These include compensatory changes in (1) postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor abundance, (2) presynaptic morphology, and (3) active zone structure. Together, this characterization identifies new mutants with defects in synaptic growth and the adaptive strategies used by synapses to homeostatically stabilize neurotransmission in response. © 2019 the authors.","Homeostasis; Neuromuscular junction; Neurotransmission; Plasticity; Synapse; Synaptic growth","animal experiment; Article; confocal microscopy; controlled study; Drosophila; electrophysiology; female; genetic analysis; image analysis; larva; male; morphology; mutant; neuromuscular junction; neurotransmission; nonhuman; priority journal; synapse; synaptic growth; synaptic strength; animal; mutation; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; synaptic transmission; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Drosophila; Female; Male; Mutation; Neuromuscular Junction; Neuronal Plasticity; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065544045

Deploying them as virtual network services (VNS) brings the promise of low-cost agile deployments, which reduce time to market new services. If these virtual services are hosted dynamically over multiple clouds, greater flexibility in optimizing performance and cost can be achieved. On the flip side, when orchestrated over multiple clouds, the stringent performance norms for carrier services become difficult to meet, necessitating novel and innovative placement strategies. In selecting the appropriate combination of clouds for placement, it is important to look ahead and visualize the environment that will exist at the time a virtual network service is actually activated. This serves multiple purposes — clouds can be selected to optimize the cost, the chosen performance parameters can be kept within the defined limits, and the speed of placement can be increased. In this paper, we propose the P-ART (Predictive-Adaptive Real Time) framework that relies on predictive-deductive features to achieve these objectives. With so much riding on predictions, we include in our framework a novel concept-drift compensation technique to make the predictions closer to reality by taking care of long-term traffic variations. At the same time, near real-time update of the prediction models takes care of sudden short-term variations. These predictions are then used by a new randomized placement heuristic that carries out a fast cloud selection using a least-cost latency-constrained policy. An empirical analysis carried out using datasets from a queuing-theoretic model and also through implementation on CloudLab, proves the effectiveness of the P-ART framework. The placement system works fast, placing thousands of functions in a sub-minute time frame with a high acceptance ratio, making it suitable for dynamic placement. We expect the framework to be an important step in making the deployment of carrier-grade VNS on multi-cloud systems, using network function virtualization (NFV), a reality. © 2019 The Authors","Dynamic placement; Machine learning; Multi-cloud systems; Network function virtualization; Service function chain; Virtual network function; Virtual network services","Arts computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Optimization; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Multi-clouds; Optimizing performance; Performance parameters; Placement strategy; Service functions; Short-term variations; Virtual network services; Virtual networks; Network function virtualization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064493598

Loss of Cbl protein function is associated with malignant transformation driven by increased RTK activity. RF E3s, such as the Cbl proteins, interact with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to confer specificity to the ubiquitination process and direct the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to one or more lysines on the target proteins. Using in vitro E3 assays and yeast two-hybrid screens, we found that Ube2d, Ube2e families, Ube2n/2v1, and Ube2w catalyze autoubiquitination of the Cbl protein and Ube2d2, Ube2e1, and Ube 2n/2v1 catalyze Cbl-mediated substrate ubiquitination of the EGFR and SYK. Phosphorylation of the Cbl protein by by Src resulted in increased E3 activity compared to unphosphorylated cbl or Cbl containing a phosphomimetic Y371E mutation. Ubiquitin chain formation depended on the E2 tested with Cbl with Ube2d2 forming both K48 and K63 linked chains, Ube2n/2v1 forming only K63 linked chains, and Ube2w inducing monoubiquitination. In cells, the Ube2d family, Ube2e family, and Ube2n/2v1 contributed to EGFR ubiquitination. Our data suggest that multiple E2s can interact with Cbl and modulate its E3 activity in vitro and in cells. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Results: Three months prior to on-site arrival, a WhatsApp Messenger group was created for information-sharing and distribution of teaching materials. A surgical curriculum was created to incorporate didactics, cartilage framework simulation, and live surgery. During the intensive on-site week, WhatsApp was used to distribute materials and to recap learning points from each case, with pre- and postoperative surgical photographs circulated. Postmodule written, oral, and practical testing was conducted on the final day, and a postmodule survey was administered a month later. Post-tests scores were significantly improved from pretests scores. Initial scores on the written, oral, and practical tests averaged 24.6%. Postmodule scores averaged 86.9% (p < 0.001). Participants rated the use of WhatsApp to be highly important to their learning and requested further use of mobile health technology. Conclusions: WhatsApp Messenger technology complemented a reconstructive surgery education module in a LMIC. WhatsApp provides opportunities for premodule patient screening, real-time discussion, and postmodule review. Its usage was well-received by Haitian otolaryngology trainees and faculty. Our results suggest that the combination of didactic teaching, simulated surgery, and live surgery resulted in successful transfer of both skills and knowledge. © 2018","Capacity building; Education; Low-middle income countries; Patient Care; Surgical simulation","adult; article; capacity building; cartilage; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; curriculum; face surgery; female; Haiti; human; learning; male; middle income country; otorhinolaryngology; patient care; photography; prospective study; reconstructive surgery; simulation; skill; student; surgery; teaching; clinical competence; curriculum; education; external ear; Haiti; medical education; mobile application; plastic surgery; procedures; surgery; text messaging; Adult; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Ear, External; Education, Distance; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Measurement; Female; Haiti; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Mobile Applications; Otolaryngology; Prospective Studies; Surgery, Plastic; Text Messaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056996740

We developed an analysis procedure for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles and used it to demonstrate that even relatively hydrophobic IDPs remain nearly as expanded in water as they are in high denaturant concentrations. In contrast, as demonstrated here, most fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements have indicated that relatively hydrophobic IDPs contract significantly in the absence of denaturant. We use two independent approaches to further explore this controversy. First, using SAXS we show that fluorophores employed in FRET can contribute to the observed discrepancy. Specifically, we find that addition of Alexa-488 to a normally expanded IDP causes contraction by an additional 15%, a value in reasonable accord with the contraction reported in FRET-based studies. Second, using our simulations and analysis procedure to accurately extract both the radius of gyration (Rg) and end-to-end distance (Ree) from SAXS profiles, we tested the recent suggestion that FRET and SAXS results can be reconciled if the Rg and Ree are “uncoupled” (i.e., no longer simply proportional), in contrast to the case for random walk homopolymers. We find, however, that even for unfolded proteins, these two measures of unfolded state dimensions remain proportional. Together, these results suggest that improved analysis procedures and a correction for significant, fluorophore-driven interactions are sufficient to reconcile prior SAXS and FRET studies, thus providing a unified picture of the nature of unfolded polypeptide chains in the absence of denaturant. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Structural characterization of these complexes, including identification of all binding partners, their relative binding affinities, and complex topology, is integral for understanding function. Understanding how proteins assemble and how subunits in a complex interact is a cornerstone of structural biology. Here we report a native mass spectrometry (MS)-based method to characterize subunit interactions in globular protein complexes. We demonstrate that dissociation of protein complexes by surface collisions, at the lower end of the typical surface-induced dissociation (SID) collision energy range, consistently cleaves the weakest protein:protein interfaces, producing products that are reflective of the known structure. We present here combined results for multiple complexes as a training set, two validation cases, and four computational models. We show that SID appearance energies can be predicted from structures via a computationally derived expression containing three terms (number of residues in a given interface, unsatisfied hydrogen bonds, and a rigidity factor). © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Lucas Center for Imaging, Stanford, CA, United States","Diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) provides model-free estimation of the diffusion ensemble average propagator (EAP) and orientation distribution function (ODF) but requires the diffusion data to be acquired on a Cartesian q-space grid. Multi-shell diffusion acquisitions are more flexible and more commonly acquired but have, thus far, only been compatible with model-based analysis methods. Here, we propose a generalized DSI (GDSI) framework to recover the EAP from multi-shell diffusion MRI data. The proposed GDSI approach corrects for q-space sampling density non-uniformity using a fast geometrical approach. The EAP is directly calculated in a preferable coordinate system by multiplying the sampling density corrected q-space signals by a discrete Fourier transform matrix, without any need for gridding. The EAP is demonstrated as a way to map diffusion patterns in brain regions such as the thalamus, cortex and brainstem where the tissue microstructure is not as well characterized as in white matter. Scalar metrics such as the zero displacement probability and displacement distances at different fractions of the zero displacement probability were computed from the recovered EAP to characterize the diffusion pattern within each voxel. The probability averaged across directions at a specific displacement distance provides a diffusion property based image contrast that clearly differentiates tissue types. The displacement distance at the first zero crossing of the EAP averaged across directions orthogonal to the primary fiber orientation in the corpus callosum is found to be larger in the body (5.65 ± 0.09 μm) than in the genu (5.55 ± 0.15 μm) and splenium (5.4 ± 0.15 μm) of the corpus callosum, which corresponds well to prior histological studies. The EAP also provides model-free representations of angular structure such as the diffusion ODF, which allows estimation and comparison of fiber orientations from both the model-free and model-based methods on the same multi-shell data. For the model-free methods, detection of crossing fibers is found to be strongly dependent on the maximum b-value and less sensitive compared to the model-based methods. In conclusion, our study provides a generalized DSI approach that allows flexible reconstruction of the diffusion EAP and ODF from multi-shell diffusion data and data acquired with other sampling patterns. © 2019","Diffusion spectrum imaging; Ensemble average propagator; Model-free; Multi-shell acquisition; Orientation distribution function; Q-space imaging; Sampling density non-uniformity correction","article; brain cortex; brain region; brain stem; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; Fourier transformation; histology; histopathology; probability; sampling; splenium; thalamus; tissues; white matter; brain; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; human; image processing; neuroimaging; procedures; Brain; Computer Simulation; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neuroimaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060859059

Despite the benefits provided by MCPS, many of the ICE medical devices have not been designed to satisfy cybersecurity requirements and, consequently, are vulnerable to recent attacks. Nowadays, ransomware attacks account for 85% of all malware in healthcare, and more than 70% of attacks confirmed data disclosure. With the goal of improving this situation, the main contribution of this paper is an automatic, intelligent and real-time system to detect, classify, and mitigate ransomware in ICE. The proposed solution is fully integrated with the ICE++ architecture, our previous work, and makes use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and classify the spreading phase of ransomware attacks affecting ICE. Additionally, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN)paradigms are considered to mitigate the ransomware spreading by isolating and replacing infected devices. Different experiments returned a precision/recall of 92.32%/99.97% in anomaly detection, an accuracy of 99.99% in ransomware classification, and promising detection and mitigation times. Finally, different labelled ransomware datasets in ICE have been created and made publicly available. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, using simple and generalizable models, we show that even such small step-to-step variability contains considerable information about strategies used to run stably. Deviations in the center of mass motion predict the corrective strategies during the next stance, well in advance of foot touchdown. Horizontal motion is stabilized by total leg impulse modulations, whereas the vertical motion is stabilized by differentially modulating the impulse within stance. We implement these human-derived control strategies on a simple computational biped, showing that it runs stably for hundreds of steps despite incessant noise-like perturbations or larger discrete perturbations.

Neuromuscular stimulation is a therapeutic approach to treat impairments such as stroke or pain, although the resulting inputs to the nervous system due to the stimulation are not well quantified. Stimulation activates both afferents and efferents, and the resulting neural activity is a mix of the effects of both: the changes in afferent activity due to efferent physiological actions plus the alterations due to afferent stimulation. This study quantitatively describes the resulting Golgi tendon organ Ib afferent activity in response to mixed afferent and efferent stimulation. Approach. Neural and stimulated action potentials interact by means of collision, neural resetting, and refractory block. We simulated the action potential patterns of Ib afferents in the human first dorsal interosseous during constant voluntary, stimulated, and combined contractions, varying both stimulation rate and location, and both with and without simultaneous Ib stimulation. Main results. Efferent stimulation affects the firing rate versus force relationships of individual tendon organs, but the effects on the population mean are very small. In contrast, afferent stimulation changes the firing rate versus force relationship of individual afferents by increasing the firing rate, decreasing the force resolution, broadening the distribution of action potential rates, and temporally phase locking a portion of the action potentials. Force resolution is retained in the population mean. The effects of afferent stimulation change with the stimulation rate and location, and with receptor firing rates. Significance. This is the first quantitative description of the changes in afferent feedback during combined efferent and afferent nerve stimulation. The small effects of efferent stimulation on the population response implies that tendon organs could provide accurate force feedback during stimulated contractions. The effects of afferent stimulation can be altered by choice of stimulus rate and site and are generalizable to other afferents. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","afferent stimulation; efferent stimulation; model; nerve stimulation; neuromodulation; tendon organ","Article; feedback system; firing rate; force; motor nerve; nerve potential; nerve stimulation; neuromodulation; peripheral nerve; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sensory nerve; simulation; stimulus response; tendon receptor; action potential; human; mechanoreceptor; muscle contraction; peripheral nerve; physiology; sensory nerve; sensory nerve cell; Action Potentials; Afferent Pathways; Humans; Mechanoreceptors; Muscle Contraction; Neurons, Afferent; Peripheral Nerves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059904039

Our objective was to identify trainee characteristics that predict the transfer of simulator-acquired skill to the operating room. Methods: Trainees completed baseline assessments including intracorporeal suturing (IS) performance, attentional selectivity, self-reported use of mental skills, and self-reported prior clinical and simulated laparoscopic experience and confidence. Residents then followed proficiency-based laparoscopic skills training, and their skill transfer was assessed on a live-anesthetized porcine model. Predictive characteristics for transfer test performance were assessed using multiple linear regression. Results: Thirty-eight residents completed the study. Automaticity, attentional selectivity, resident perceived ability with laparoscopy and simulators, and post-training IS performance were predictive of IS performance during the transfer test.

As a response, the “Don't Gamble Away our Future (DGAOF)” program has been implemented among children in central Illinois. We aim to assess the long-term effectiveness of this school-based youth gambling prevention program in Illinois using the data from 2005 to 2009. The intervention included interactive PowerPoint presentations and prevention materials in parent packets. Students aged 8 to 18 years were eligible to participate in the intervention and the questionnaire pre-post knowledge tests (total score 0-9). Students in 5th grade and above also received a gambling behavior screen test using the Modified South Oaks Gambling Screening for Teens (MSOGST) for identifying probable gamblers. Multivariable generalized mixed models were conducted to detect the effects of a 5-year youth gambling prevention program as controlling potential confounders. A total of 16,262 and 16,421 students completed pre-post tests and MSOGST tests, respectively. Of 16,262, half were female, the majority (76.1%) were from senior high school, and 21.3% received the intervention at least twice. The median gap between interventions was 368 days. Students receiving multiple interventions had higher scores on the pre-test as compared to those receiving a single intervention (P<0.001 for all comparisons among groups), and they demonstrated an increasing trend of awareness about gambling over time (P<0.001 for multiple interventions; P = 0.538 for single intervention). The prevalence of problem gambling had decreased among students receiving the intervention twice as compared to receiving the intervention once (7.9% versus 9.4%; OR = 0.89, 95% CL: 0.82-0.97). However, this effect was not confirmed among students receiving the intervention three or more times. In conclusion, the DGAOF program has demonstrated a positive long-term impact on increasing gambling knowledge and partially reducing pathological gamblers through direct training. It suggests that multiple repeated interventions are important for youth gambling prevention. © 2019 Ren et al.

Study design This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The experimental group (n = 109) received patterned, frequency-modulated oral stimulation via the NTrainer system through a pulsatile pacifier and the control group (n = 101) received a non-pulsatile pacifier. Intent-to-treat analysis (n = 210) was performed to compare the experimental and control groups and the outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Time-to-event analyses for time to reach full oral feeds and length of hospital stay were conducted using Cox proportional hazards models. Results The experimental group had reduction in time to full oral feeds compared to the control group (-4.1 days, HR 1.37 (1.03, 1.82) p = 0.03). In the 29-30 weeks subgroup, infants in the experimental group had a significant reduction in time to discharge (-10 days, HR 1.87 (1.23, 2.84) p < 0.01). This difference was not observed in the 26-28 weeks subgroup. There was no difference in growth, mortality or morbidities between the two groups. Conclusions Patterned, frequency-modulated oro-somatosensory stimulation improves feeding development in premature infants and reduces their length of hospitalization.

However, previously we showed that the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) operates like a single electrotonic compartment, despite having thousands of branch points and total cable length >10 mm (Otopalik et al., 2017a; 2017b). Here we show that compact electrotonic architecture is generalizable to other STG neuron types, and that these neurons present direction-insensitive, linear voltage integration, suggesting they pool synaptic inputs across their neuronal structures. We also show, using simulations of 720 cable models spanning a broad range of geometries and passive properties, that compact electrotonus, linear integration, and directional insensitivity in STG neurons arise from their neurite geometries (diameters tapering from 10-20 µm to < 2 µm at their terminal tips).

In theory, combining transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with electroencephalography (EEG) is compelling, as both use non-invasive electrodes and image-guided dose can be informed by the reciprocity principle. To distinguish real changes in EEG from stimulation artifacts, prior studies applied conventional signal processing techniques (e.g. high-pass filtering, ICA). Here, we address the assumptions underlying the suitability of these approaches. We distinguish physiological artifacts - defined as artifacts resulting from interactions between the stimulation induced voltage and the body and so inherent regardless of tDCS or EEG hardware performance – from methodology-related artifacts - arising from non-ideal experimental conditions or non-ideal stimulation and recording equipment performance. Critically, we identify inherent physiological artifacts which are present in all online EEG-tDCS: 1) cardiac distortion and 2) ocular motor distortion. In conjunction, non-inherent physiological artifacts which can be minimized in most experimental conditions include: 1) motion and 2) myogenic distortion. Artifact dynamics were analyzed for varying stimulation parameters (montage, polarity, current) and stimulation hardware. Together with concurrent physiological monitoring (ECG, respiration, ocular, EMG, head motion), and current flow modeling, each physiological artifact was explained by biological source-specific body impedance changes, leading to incremental changes in scalp DC voltage that are significantly larger than real neural signals. Because these artifacts modulate the DC voltage and scale with applied current, they are dose specific such that their contamination cannot be accounted for by conventional experimental controls (e.g. differing stimulation montage or current as a control). Moreover, because the EEG artifacts introduced by physiologic processes during tDCS are high dimensional (as indicated by Generalized Singular Value Decomposition- GSVD), non-stationary, and overlap highly with neurogenic frequencies, these artifacts cannot be easily removed with conventional signal processing techniques. Spatial filtering techniques (GSVD) suggest that the removal of physiological artifacts would significantly degrade signal integrity. Physiological artifacts, as defined here, would emerge only during tDCS, thus processing techniques typically applied to EEG in the absence of tDCS would not be suitable for artifact removal during tDCS. All concurrent EEG-tDCS must account for physiological artifacts that are a) present regardless of equipment used, and b) broadband and confound a broad range of experiments (e.g. oscillatory activity and event related potentials). Removal of these artifacts requires the recognition of their non-stationary, physiology-specific dynamics, and individualized nature. We present a broad taxonomy of artifacts (non/stimulation related), and suggest possible approaches and challenges to denoising online EEG-tDCS stimulation artifacts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Electrocardiogram (ECG); Electroencephalography (EEG); Finite element method (FEM); Physiological artifact; Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); Transcranial electric stimulation (tES)","adult; Article; artifact; artifact reduction; breathing; electric potential; electroencephalography; electromyogram; eye movement; female; head movement; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; male; methodology related artifact; motion; muscle contracture; normal human; physiological artifact; priority journal; signal processing; transcranial direct current stimulation; adolescent; brain; brain mapping; computer simulation; electroencephalography; physiology; procedures; signal processing; transcranial direct current stimulation; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Artifacts; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055674910

A related problem concerns the timescale of this angular momentum transfer. Experiments have established that intense photoexcitation in several metallic ferromagnets leads to a drop in magnetization on a timescale shorter than 100 femtoseconds—a phenomenon called ultrafast demagnetization2–4. Although the microscopic mechanism for this process has been hotly debated, the key question of where the angular momentum goes on these femtosecond timescales remains unanswered. Here we use femtosecond time-resolved X-ray diffraction to show that most of the angular momentum lost from the spin system upon laser-induced demagnetization of ferromagnetic iron is transferred to the lattice on sub-picosecond timescales, launching a transverse strain wave that propagates from the surface into the bulk. By fitting a simple model of the X-ray data to simulations and optical data, we estimate that the angular momentum transfer occurs on a timescale of 200 femtoseconds and corresponds to 80 per cent of the angular momentum that is lost from the spin system. Our results show that interaction with the lattice has an essential role in the process of ultrafast demagnetization in this system. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",,"ferromagnetic iron; iron; unclassified drug; acceleration; analytic method; demagnetization; Letter; magnetic field; mathematical model; priority journal; simulation; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059798609

Prior research shows that when interacting with novel dynamics humans develop internal models that map neural commands to limb motion and vice versa. Whether this can be extrapolated to locomotor rehabilitation, a continuous and rhythmic activity that involves dynamically complex interactions, is unknown. In this case, humans could default to model-free strategies. These competing hypotheses were tested with a novel interactive locomotor simulator that reproduced the dynamics of hemiparetic gait. A group of 16 healthy subjects practiced using a small robotic manipulandum to alter the gait of a virtual patient (VP) that had an asymmetric locomotor pattern modeled after stroke survivors. The point of interaction was the ankle of the VP’s affected leg, and the goal was to make the VP’s gait symmetric. Internal model formation was probed with unexpected force channels and null force fields. Generalization was assessed by changing the target locomotor pattern and comparing outcomes with a second group of 10 naive subjects who did not practice the initial symmetric target pattern. Results supported the internal model hypothesis with aftereffects and generalization of manipulation skill. Internal models demonstrated refinements that capitalized on the natural pendular dynamics of human locomotion. This work shows that despite the complex interactive dynamics involved in shaping locomotor patterns, humans nevertheless develop and use internal models that are refined with experience. © 2019, American Physiological Society.

Background: Many believe that training on abstract computer-based exercises and video games enhances cognitive capacities to the benefit of performance in operational contexts. The basic research in this area is controversial. Method: We summarize reviews of the basic research data on transfer from training on abstract computer-based exercises and video games and undertake a detailed methodological review of flight and driving transfer studies. Results: Reviews of basic transfer research fail to reveal evidence of general transfer, although a few applied studies are said to show general transfer to driving or flight control. Our review of these applied studies identifies issues with research methods and data interpretation that compromise the credibility of their results to an extent that they do not provide robust evidence of general transfer from abstract computer-based exercises or video games. Conclusion: The state of cognitive training and video game training in relation to transfer has failed to meet early expectations. Much of the research in this area suffers from inadequate experimental control and flawed interpretation of results.

However, information on DDI profiles is incomplete and the experimental determination of DDIs is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Although previous studies have explored various feature spaces for in silico screening of interacting drug pairs, their use of conventional cross-validation prevents them from achieving generalizable performance on drug pairs where neither drug is seen during training. Here we demonstrate for the first time targets of adversely interacting drug pairs are significantly more likely to have synergistic genetic interactions than non-interacting drug pairs. Leveraging genetic interaction features and a novel training scheme, we construct a gradient boosting-based classifier that achieves robust DDI prediction even for drugs whose interaction profiles are completely unseen during training. We demonstrate that in addition to classification power -including the prediction of 432 novel DDIs-our genetic interaction approach offers interpretability by providing plausible mechanistic insights into the mode of action of DDIs. © 2019 Qian et al.",,"alendronic acid; alitretinoin; amlodipine; atorvastatin; belinostat; bumetanide; calcitriol; ceftriaxone; chlorothiazide; chlorpromazine; desflurane; diazoxide; didanosine; fluindostatin; hydrochlorothiazide; isoflurane; liothyronine; lithium; melatonin; nicardipine; promethazine; retinoic acid; retinol; romidepsin; rosuvastatin; sevoflurane; spironolactone; trimethadione; unindexed drug; valproic acid; Article; classifier; computer model; controlled study; drug induced disease; drug interaction; drug potentiation; drug safety; gene interaction; gene targeting; human; polypharmacy; prediction; prescription; biological model; biology; computer simulation; drug database; drug effect; epistasis; genetic database; genetics; machine learning; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Databases, Genetic; Databases, Pharmaceutical; Drug Interactions; Epistasis, Genetic; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Models, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067376005

This paper presents a study of transfer from the game Rock Band to within-game and non-game musical tasks. Thirty-four undergraduates with low to moderate prior Rock Band experience participated in the study. For initial instruction, they were randomly assigned to either a Drill condition, using the built-in training feature of the videogame, or a teacher-led Lesson condition which focused on strategic and procedural knowledge of drumming techniques. Non-game transfer tasks included: (1) drumming along with music sequencing software (GarageBand), (2) a call and response task, and (3) a task where participants commented on the technique of other drummers. Results showed that prior experience with Rock Band was a significant predictor for the GarageBand transfer tasks but not for the call and response or commenting tasks. Both instructional conditions performed equally well on Rock Band tasks, but those in the Lesson condition performed better on commenting tasks, as well as on GarageBand tasks after controlling for Rock Band skill. These findings replicate and extend prior research on the ability of game play experience to transfer to non-game musical tasks, while adding the finding that traditional lessons can effectively augment in-game learning experiences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Interactive learning environments; Media in education; Music; Simulations; Transfer","Computer aided instruction; Personnel training; Teaching; Interactive learning environment; Media in education; Music; Simulations; Transfer; Rocks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054809904

This lineal process means that an organism’s adaptive potential can be restricted by its evolutionary history, the amount of standing genetic variation, and its mutation rate. Lateral gene transfer (LGT) theoretically provides a mechanism to bypass many of these limitations, but the evolutionary importance and frequency of this process in multicellular eukaryotes, such as plants, remains debated. We address this issue by assembling a chromosome-level genome for the grass Alloteropsis semialata, a species surmised to exhibit two LGTs, and screen it for other grass-to-grass LGTs using genomic data from 146 other grass species. Through stringent phylogenomic analyses, we discovered 57 additional LGTs in the A. semialata nuclear genome, involving at least nine different donor species. The LGTs are clustered in 23 laterally acquired genomic fragments that are up to 170 kb long and have accumulated during the diversification of Alloteropsis. The majority of the 59 LGTs in A. semialata are expressed, and we show that they have added functions to the recipient genome. Functional LGTs were further detected in the genomes of five other grass species, demonstrating that this process is likely widespread in this globally important group of plants. LGT therefore appears to represent a potent evolutionary force capable of spreading functional genes among distantly related grass species. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

However, both the large-scale trophic organization of this ecosystem, and its effects on the underlying metabolic flow, remain unexplored. Here, using a simplified model, we provide quantitative support for a multi-level trophic organization of the human gut microbiome, where microbes consume and secrete metabolites in multiple iterative steps. Using a manually-curated set of metabolic interactions between microbes, our model suggests about four trophic levels, each characterized by a high level-to-level metabolic transfer of byproducts. It also quantitatively predicts the typical metabolic environment of the gut (fecal metabolome) in approximate agreement with the real data. To understand the consequences of this trophic organization, we quantify the metabolic flow and biomass distribution, and explore patterns of microbial and metabolic diversity in different levels. The hierarchical trophic organization suggested by our model can help mechanistically establish causal links between the abundances of microbes and metabolites in the human gut. © 2019 Wang et al.

Recently, Zhao, Lesmes, and Lu (2017, 2019) developed the quick Change Detection (qCD) method and applied it to measure the trial-by-trial time course of dark adaptation. In the current study, we conducted two simulations to evaluate the performance of the 3-down/1-up staircase and qCD methods in measuring perceptual learning in a two-alternative forced-choice task. In Study 1, three observers with different time constants (40, 80, and 160 trials) of an exponential learning curve were simulated. Each simulated observer completed staircases with six step sizes (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 60%) and a qCD procedure, each starting at five levels (+50%, +25%, 0, -25%, and-50% different from the true threshold in the first trial). We found the following results: Staircases with 1% and 5% step sizes failed to generate more than five reversals half of the time; and the bias and standard deviations of thresholds estimated from the post hoc segment-by-segment qCD analysis were much smaller than those from the staircase method with the other four step sizes. In Study 2, we simulated thresholds in the transfer phases with the same time constants and 50% transfer for each observer in Study 1.We found that the estimated transfer indexes from qCD showed smaller biases and standard deviations than those from the staircase method. In addition, rescoring the simulated data from the staircase method using the Bayesian estimation component of the qCD method resulted in much-improved estimates. We conclude that the qCD method characterizes the time course of perceptual learning and transfer more accurately, precisely, and efficiently than the staircase method, even with the optimal 10% step size. © 2019 The Authors.","Adaptive testing; Perceptual learning; Quick Change Detection; Staircase; Transfer","Bayes theorem; dark adaptation; decision making; discrimination learning; human; learning curve; perceptive threshold; physiology; repetition priming; Bayes Theorem; Choice Behavior; Dark Adaptation; Discrimination Learning; Humans; Learning Curve; Repetition Priming; Sensory Thresholds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070365866

To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla- Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts. © 2019 Cochran, Cisler.

While it is manifest that cells utilize both intracellular and intercellular interactions, the coupling between the two modules, essential to the coordination of collective polarization, remains an active area of investigation. We propose a generalized reaction- diffusion model to study the role of intracellular interactions in the emergence of longrange polarization, and show that the nonlocality of cytoplasmic interactions, i.e. coupling of membrane proteins localized on different cell-cell junctions, is of vital importance to the faithful detection of weak directional signals, and becomes increasingly more crucial to the stability of polarization against the deleterious effects of large geometric irregularities. We demonstrate that nonlocal interactions are necessary for geometric information to become accessible to the PCP components. The prediction of the model regarding polarization in elongated tissues, is shown to be in agreement with experimental observations, where the polarity emerges perpendicular to the axis of elongation. Core PCP is adopted as a model pathway, in term of which we interpret the model parameters. To this end, we introduce three distinct classes of mutations, (I) in membrane proteins, (II) in cytoplasmic proteins, and (III) local enhancement of geometric disorder. Comparing the in silico and in vivo phenotypes, we show that our model successfully recapitulates the salient phenotypic features of these mutations. Exploring the parameter space helps us shed light on the role of cytoplasmic proteins in cell-cell communications, and make falsifiable predictions regarding the cooperation of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in the establishment of longrange polarization. © 2019 Shadkhoo, Mani.

In many cases, these regions of high bacterial concentration are thought to form when motile cells use chemotaxis to navigate to chemical hotspots. However, what governs the dynamics of bacterial aggregations is unclear. Here, we use an experimental platform to create realistic submillimeter-scale nutrient pulses with controlled nutrient concentrations. By combining experiments, mathematical theory, and agent-based simulations, we show that individual Vibrio ordalii bacteria begin chemotaxis toward hotspots of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when the magnitude of the chemical gradient rises sufficiently far above the sensory noise that is generated by stochastic encounters with chemoattractant molecules. Each DOM hotspot is surrounded by a dynamic ring of chemotaxing cells, which congregate in regions of highDOMconcentration before dispersing as DOM diffuses and gradients become too noisy for cells to respond to. We demonstrate that V. ordalii operates close to the theoretical limits on chemotactic precision. Numerical simulations of chemotactic bacteria, in which molecule counting noise is explicitly taken into account, point at a tradeoff between nutrient acquisition and the cost of chemotactic precision.

Although computing power is increasing, the complexity of the systems being simulated is also increasing. If the computation is not well matched to the computing hardware, simulations can take lengthy times to run, which can make it more difficult to draw inferences from those simulations and also to use them in feedback with living neurons such as in the dynamic clamp. New method: In this paper, we perform a quantitative analysis to get a better sense of how much impact the hardware architectures can have on simulation performance. Three different architectures are implemented on the same hardware platform and compared with respect to simulation time, error, and resources used. Results: The results indicate that a lookup table approach to evaluate functions can decrease simulation time by orders of magnitude with respect to the traditional approach of mathematical operations. Comparison with existing method(s): There are many different ways to implement a lookup table approach to evaluate a function. The method presented in this paper sacrifices some speed for greater generality and accuracy with respect to other published methods. Conclusions: Lookup tables with 32 interpolation points can dramatically speed up computation time of neural simulations without adding significant error. In this paper linear interpolation was used, but higher order interpolation could be used to further reduce simulation time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"algorithm; Article; comparative study; controlled study; feedback system; latent period; mathematical model; membrane current; membrane potential; nerve cell; priority journal; quantitative analysis; simulation; steady state; action potential; animal; biological model; computer; computer simulation; computer system; leech; nerve cell; physiology; software; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Computer Simulation; Computer Systems; Computers; Leeches; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055040413

In these studies, each retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type demonstrated a characteristic stimulus-strength-dependent response to HFS, offering the intriguing possibility of focally targeting retinal neurons to provide useful visual information by retinal prosthetics. Ionic mechanisms are known to affect the responses of electrogenic cells during electrical stimulation. However, how these mechanisms affect RGC responses is not well understood at present, particularly when applying HFS. Here, we investigate this issue via an in silico model of the RGC. We calibrate and validate the model using an in vitro retinal preparation. An RGC model based on accurate biophysics and realistic representation of cell morphology, was used to investigate how RGCs respond to HFS. The model was able to closely replicate the stimulus-strength-dependent suppression of RGC action potentials observed experimentally. Our results suggest that spike inhibition during HFS is due to local membrane hyperpolarization caused by outward membrane currents near the stimulus electrode. In addition, the extent of HFS-induced inhibition can be largely altered by the intrinsic properties of the inward sodium current. Finally, stimulus-strength-dependent suppression can be modulated by a wide range of stimulation frequencies, under generalized electrode placement conditions. In vitro experiments verified the computational modeling data. This modeling and experimental approach can be extended to further our understanding on the effects of novel stimulus strategies by simulating RGC stimulus-response profiles over a wider range of stimulation frequencies and electrode locations than have previously been explored.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: University-based medical center in Quito, Ecuador. Participants: First- and second-year otolaryngology residents in Quito, Ecuador. Results: Residents participated in an intensive 3-day teaching program focused on microtia, nasoseptal abnormalities, and facial paralysis that included didactic lectures, simulation workshops, and live surgery. Residents underwent rigorous pre- and postmodule testing including written, oral, and practical examinations in each subject area. All participants completed anonymous feedback surveys with ratings on a Likert scale from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Nineteen residents completed both pre- and postmodule testing. The training module was successfully implemented and testing performance across all 3 subject areas significantly improved. Resident feedback was exceedingly positive, with average scores for each component ranging from 8.9 to 9.8, with highest scores given to the simulation workshops. The postmodule survey indicated that all residents found the course helpful and they desired additional courses covering more subject areas. Conclusions: Implementation of an intensive surgical training module combining didactics, surgical simulation, and live surgery resulted in the successful transfer of both skills and knowledge. While the long-term benefit of this program is yet to be determined, this model of training may prove to be a useful tool to help address surgical capacity building in the developing world. © 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","capacity building; education; low-middle income countries; Patient Care; surgical simulation","Article; capacity building; cohort analysis; facial nerve paralysis; human; knowledge; microtia; middle income country; nose malformation; nose reconstruction; nose septum reconstruction; otorhinolaryngology; plastic surgery; priority journal; prospective study; reconstructive surgery; residency education; resident; simulation; skill; surgical training; curriculum; Ecuador; education; face; medical education; plastic surgery; poverty; reconstructive surgery; simulation training; surgery; Capacity Building; Curriculum; Ecuador; Face; Humans; Internship and Residency; Otolaryngology; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Surgery, Plastic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050983688

Here, we revisit a fundamental question in signaling pathway analysis: are two molecules ""connected"" in a network? This question is the first step towards understanding the potential influence of molecules in a pathway, and the answer depends on the choice of modeling framework. We examined the connectivity of Reactome signaling pathways using four different pathway representations. We find that Reactome is very well connected as a graph, moderately well connected as a compound graph or bipartite graph, and poorly connected as a hypergraph (which captures many-to-many relationships in reaction networks). We present a novel relaxation of hypergraph connectivity that iteratively increases connectivity from a node while preserving the hypergraph topology. This measure, B-relaxation distance, provides a parameterized transition between hypergraph connectivity and graph connectivity. B-relaxation distance is sensitive to the presence of small molecules that participate in many functionally unrelated reactions in the network. We also define a score that quantifies one pathway's downstream influence on another, which can be calculated as B-relaxation distance gradually relaxes the connectivity constraint in hypergraphs. Computing this score across all pairs of 34 Reactome pathways reveals pairs of pathways with statistically significant influence. We present two such case studies, and we describe the specific reactions that contribute to the large influence score. Finally, we investigate the ability for connectivity measures to capture functional relationships among proteins, and use the evidence channels in the STRING database as a benchmark dataset. STRING interactions whose proteins are B-connected in Reactome have statistically significantly higher scores than interactions connected in the bipartite graph representation. Our method lays the groundwork for other generalizations of graph-theoretic concepts to hypergraphs in order to facilitate signaling pathway analysis. © 2019 Franzese et al.",,"article; case report; clinical article; human; leisure; signal transduction; theoretical study; algorithm; computer simulation; factual database; physiology; signal transduction; statistical model; protein; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Models, Statistical; Proteins; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074674669

FGF2 binding kinetics have been predominantly studied in static culture; however, the endothelium is constantly exposed to flow which may affect FGF2 binding. We therefore used experimental and computational techniques to study how EC FGF2 binding changes in flow. ECs adapted to 24 h of flow demonstrated biphasic FGF2-HSPG binding, with FGF2-HSPG complexes increasing up to 20 dynes/cm2 shear stress and then decreasing at higher shear stresses. To understand how adaptive EC surface remodeling in response to shear stress may affect FGF2 binding to FGFR and HSPG, we implemented a computational model to predict the relative effects of flow-induced surface receptor changes. We then fit the computational model to the experimental data using relationships between HSPG availability and FGF2-HSPG dissociation and flow that were developed from a basement membrane study, as well as including HSPG production. These studies suggest that FGF2 binding kinetics are altered in flow-adapted ECs due to changes in cell surface receptor quantity, availability, and binding kinetics, which may affect cell growth factor response. © 2019, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Binding kinetics; Endothelial cells; Fibroblast growth factor-2; Fluid flow; Heparan sulfate proteoglycans; Mass transport; Shear stress","Cell culture; Cell membranes; Computation theory; Computational methods; Endothelial cells; Fibroblasts; Flow of fluids; Glycoproteins; Growth kinetics; Kinetics; Mass transfer; Shear stress; Sulfur compounds; Basement membrane; Binding kinetics; Cell surface receptors; Computational model; Computational technique; Fibroblast growth factor-2; Heparan sulfate proteoglycans; Surface receptors; Shear flow; fibroblast growth factor 2; fibroblast growth factor receptor; proteoheparan sulfate; animal; biological model; cell culture; computer simulation; mechanical stress; metabolism; phosphorylation; pig; shear strength; signal transduction; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Computer Simulation; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans; Models, Biological; Phosphorylation; Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor; Shear Strength; Signal Transduction; Stress, Mechanical; Swine",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060815734

The traditional Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) offers the most robust and reliable solution; however, MCS is time consuming and unable to support prompt risk decisions. To relieve the computational burden, a novel probabilistic method - AMETA (Aircraft Maintenance Event Tree Analysis) - was developed, which combines the generality of random simulations with the efficiency of analytical probabilistic methods. AMETA consists of a fatigue maintenance event tree and a probabilistic algorithm comprising a set of probabilistic equations. AMETA systematically transforms a complex random maintenance pattern requiring a large number (in the order of billions) of MCSs to more logical and manageable fatigue paths represented by a finite set of probabilistic events to achieve the required computational accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the Importance Sampling Method (ISM) can be used for efficiency improvement. In this paper, the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of AMETA are verified and demonstrated. A procedure was provided to select the most suitable sampling functions for ISM. It is found that AMETA is several orders of magnitude more efficient than MCS for the same level of accuracy. © 2019 SPIE.

All these services impose divergent and often mutually exclusive requirements in terms of data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. To satisfy heterogeneous requirements, 5G systems should have such properties as Quality-of-Experience awareness, adaptability and flexibility, scalability and reliability, support for multiple RATs and backward compatibility, all at a low CAPEX and OPEX. To this end, software-defined networking and network function virtualization have been envisioned as key enabling technologies for 5G, and represent a major paradigm shift for 5G systems. In recent years, a plethora of software-defined mobile network architectures have been introduced worldwide, each with their unique features and drawbacks. Within this context, this paper introduces a new architecture called ARBAT which has been designed to satisfy and exceed the requirements put forth by 5G. ARBAT is characterized by many innovative features such as the Universal Network Device and Unified Cellular Network concepts, multi-slice modular resource management with the AirHYPE wireless hypervisor, network-user application interaction through the xStream platform, and simplified multi-tenant orchestration through ServiceBRIDGE. The novel features of the ARBAT infrastructure plane, data plane, control plane and Management and Orchestration entity are also explained in the paper in detail.

Therapies act on this combined cancer-host system, sometimes with unexpected results. Systematic investigation of mechanistic computational models can augment traditional laboratory and clinical studies, helping identify the factors driving a treatment's success or failure. However, given the uncertainties regarding the underlying biology, these multiscale computational models can take many potential forms, in addition to encompassing high-dimensional parameter spaces. Therefore, the exploration of these models is computationally challenging. We propose that integrating two existing technologies-one to aid the construction of multiscale agent-based models, the other developed to enhance model exploration and optimization-can provide a computational means for high-throughput hypothesis testing, and eventually, optimization. Results: In this paper, we introduce a high throughput computing (HTC) framework that integrates a mechanistic 3-D multicellular simulator (PhysiCell) with an extreme-scale model exploration platform (EMEWS) to investigate high-dimensional parameter spaces. We show early results in applying PhysiCell-EMEWS to 3-D cancer immunotherapy and show insights on therapeutic failure. We describe a generalized PhysiCell-EMEWS workflow for high-throughput cancer hypothesis testing, where hundreds or thousands of mechanistic simulations are compared against data-driven error metrics to perform hypothesis optimization. Conclusions: While key notational and computational challenges remain, mechanistic agent-based models and high-throughput model exploration environments can be combined to systematically and rapidly explore key problems in cancer. These high-throughput computational experiments can improve our understanding of the underlying biology, drive future experiments, and ultimately inform clinical practice. © 2018 The Author(s).","Agent-based model; Cancer; EMEWS; High throughput computing; Hypothesis testing; Immunotherapy; PhysiCell","Autonomous agents; Computation theory; Computational methods; Digital storage; Diseases; Dynamical systems; Integration testing; Agent-based model; Cancer; EMEWS; High-throughput computing; Hypothesis testing; Immunotherapy; PhysiCell; Throughput; human; neoplasm; theoretical model; workflow; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasms; Workflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058918326

Experimentally, this has been investigated in dual adaptation, where participants adjust their reaching movements to opposing visuomotor transformations. Adaptation in these paradigms occurs by distinct processes, such as strategies for each transformation or the implicit acquisition of distinct visuomotor mappings. Although distinct, transformation-dependent aftereffects have been interpreted as support for the latter, they could reflect adaptation of a single visuomotor map, which is locally adjusted in different regions of the workspace. Indeed, recent studies suggest that explicit aiming strategies direct where in the workspace implicit adaptation occurs, thus potentially serving as a cue to enable dual adaptation. Disentangling these possibilities is critical to understanding how humans acquire and maintain motor memories for different skills and tools. We therefore investigated generalization of explicit and implicit adaptation to untrained movement directions after participants practiced two opposing cursor rotations, which were associated with the visual display being presented in the left or right half of the screen. Whereas participants learned to compensate for opposing rotations by explicit strategies specific to this visual workspace cue, aftereffects were not cue sensitive. Instead, aftereffects displayed bimodal generalization patterns that appeared to reflect locally limited learning of both transformations. By varying target arrangements and instructions, we show that these patterns are consistent with implicit adaptation that generalizes locally around movement plans associated with opposing visuomotor transformations. Our findings show that strategies can shape implicit adaptation in a complex manner. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Visuomotor dual adaptation experiments have identified contextual cues that enable learning of separate visuomotor mappings, but the underlying representations of learning are unclear. We report that visual workspace separation as a contextual cue enables the compensation of opposing cursor rotations by a combination of explicit and implicit processes: Learners developed context-dependent explicit aiming strategies, whereas an implicit visuomotor map represented dual adaptation independent from arbitrary context cues by local adaptation around the explicit movement plan. © 2018 the American Physiological Society.","Dual adaptation; Explicit strategies; Implicit learning; Motor learning; Sensorimotor","adult; article; compensation; female; human; human experiment; local adaptation; male; memory; motor learning; rotation; skill; adaptation; hand; learning; movement (physiology); pattern recognition; physiology; psychomotor performance; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Hand; Humans; Learning; Male; Movement; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Psychomotor Performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058929679

However, little is known about how potential cross-context interference, or spillover, of individual behavioural strategy impact overall cooperation. We consider three plausible spillover modes, quantifying and comparing their effects on the evolution of cooperation. In our model, social interactions take place on two network layers: repeated interactions with close neighbours in a lattice, and one-shot interactions with random individuals. Spillover can occur during the learning process with accidental cross-layer strategy transfer, or during social interactions with errors in implementation. Our analytical results, using extended pair approximation, are in good agreement with extensive simulations. We find double-edged effects of spillover: increasing the intensity of spillover can promote cooperation provided cooperation is favoured in one layer, but too much spillover is detrimental. We also discover a bistability phenomenon: spillover hinders or promotes cooperation depending on initial frequencies of cooperation in each layer. Furthermore, comparing strategy combinations emerging in each spillover mode provides good indication of their co-evolutionary dynamics with cooperation. Our results make testable predictions that inspire future research, and sheds light on human cooperation across social domains. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"adult; article; coevolution; error; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; prediction; simulation; social interaction; algorithm; cooperation; game; human relation; Algorithms; Cooperative Behavior; Game Theory; Interpersonal Relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046623066

We employ a multivariate Granger Causality-based approach to estimating directed in-network interactions and quantify its advantages using extensive realistic synthetic BOLD data simulations to match Human Connectome Project (HCP) data specification. We then apply our framework to resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data provided by the HCP to estimate the directed connectome of the human brain. We show that the functional interactions between parietal and prefrontal cortices commonly observed in rs-fMRI studies are not symmetrical, but consists of directional connectivity from parietal areas to prefrontal cortices rather than vice versa. These effects are localized within the same hemisphere and do not generalize to cross-hemispheric functional interactions. Our data are consistent with neurophysiological evidence that posterior parietal cortices involved in processing and integration of multi-sensory information modulate the function of more anterior prefrontal regions implicated in action control and goal-directed behaviour. The directionality of functional connectivity can provide an additional layer of information in interpreting rs-fMRI studies both in health and disease. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"connectome; diagnostic imaging; human; image processing; multivariate analysis; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prefrontal cortex; Connectome; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Nerve Net; Prefrontal Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044953410

Alterations in dendritic geometry and branching patterns are often accompanied by deficits that impact learning and memory. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel predictive model of neuronal dendritic damages caused by exposure to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, such as X-rays, γ-rays and high-energy protons. We established in silico representations of mouse hippocampal dentate granule cell layer (GCL) and CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are frequently examined in radiation-induced cognitive decrements. The in silico representations are used in a stochastic model that describes time dependent dendritic damage induced by exposure to low LET radiation. Changes in morphometric parameters, such as total dendritic length, number of branch points and branch number, including the Sholl analysis for single neurons are described by the model. Our model based predictions for different patterns of morphological changes based on energy deposition in dendritic segments (EDDS) will serve as a useful basis to compare specific patterns of morphological alterations caused by EDDS mechanisms. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"animal; biological model; computer simulation; cytology; dendrite; hippocampus; Markov chain; mouse; radiation response; Animals; Computer Simulation; Dendrites; Hippocampus; Mice; Models, Neurological; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044954449

Peer-assisted learning may address this need, but few rigorous evaluations have been conducted in real-world settings. A pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in 12 Ugandan districts provided facility-based, team training for prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage and birth asphyxia at 125 facilities. Three approaches to facilitating simulation-based, peer assisted learning were compared. The primary outcome was the proportion of births with uterotonic given within one minute of birth. Outcomes were evaluated using observation of birth and supplemented by skills assessments and service delivery data. Individual and composite variables were compared across groups, using generalized linear models. Overall, 107, 195, and 199 providers were observed at three time points during 1,716 births across 44 facilities. Uterotonic coverage within one minute increased from: full group: 8% (CI 4%–12%) to 50% (CI 42%–59%); partial group: 19% (CI 9%–30%) to 42% (CI 31%–53%); and control group: 11% (5%–7%) to 51% (40%–61%). Observed care of mother and newborn improved in all groups. Simulated skills maintenance for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis remained high across groups 7 to 8 months after the intervention. Simulated skills for newborn bag-and-mask ventilation remained high only in the full group.

Transitions to or out of synchrony for coupled oscillators depend on several factors, such as individual frequencies, coupling, interaction time delays and network structure-function relation. Here, using a generalized Kuramoto model of time-delay coupled phase oscillators with frequency-weighted coupling, we study the stability of incoherent and coherent states and the transitions to or out of explosive (abrupt, first-order like) phase synchronization. We analytically derive the exact formulas for the critical coupling strengths at different time delays in both directions of increasing (forward) and decreasing (backward) coupling strengths. We find that time-delay does not affect the transition for the backward direction but can shift the transition for the forward direction of increasing coupling strength. These results provide valuable insights into our understanding of dynamical mechanisms for explosive synchronization in presence of often unavoidable time delays present in many physical and biological systems. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"computer simulation; mathematical computing; theoretical model; time factor; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055071261

This technique relies on assumptions that may not be satisfied when studying genomics datasets. For example, random CV (RCV) assumes that a randomly selected set of samples, the test set, well represents unseen data. This assumption doesn't hold true where samples are obtained from different experimental conditions, and the goal is to learn regulatory relationships among the genes that generalize beyond the observed conditions. In this study, we investigated how the CV procedure affects the assessment of supervised learning methods used to learn gene regulatory networks (or in other applications). We compared the performance of a regression-based method for gene expression prediction estimated using RCV with that estimated using a clustering-based CV (CCV) procedure. Our analysis illustrates that RCV can produce over-optimistic estimates of the model's generalizability compared to CCV. Next, we defined the 'distinctness' of test set from training set and showed that this measure is predictive of performance of the regression method. Finally, we introduced a simulated annealing method to construct partitions with gradually increasing distinctness and showed that performance of different gene expression prediction methods can be better evaluated using this method. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"article; controlled study; gene regulatory network; human; learning; prediction; simulation; validation process; algorithm; biological model; biology; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; neoplasm; procedures; reproducibility; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genomics; Humans; Models, Biological; Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045973756

Desert harvester ant colonies forage for seeds, and regulate foraging to manage a tradeoff between spending and obtaining water. Foragers lose water while outside in the dry air, but ants obtain water by metabolizing the fats in the seeds they eat. Previous work shows that the rate at which an outgoing forager leaves the nest depends on its recent rate of brief antennal contacts with incoming foragers carrying food. We examine how this process can yield foraging rates that are robust to uncertainty and responsive to temperature and humidity across minute-to-hour timescales. To explore possible mechanisms, we develop a low-dimensional analytical model with a small number of parameters that captures observed foraging behavior. The model uses excitability dynamics to represent response to interactions inside the nest and a random delay distribution to represent foraging time outside the nest. We show how feedback from outgoing foragers returning to the nest stabilizes the incoming and outgoing foraging rates to a common value determined by the volatility of available foragers. The model exhibits a critical volatility above which there is sustained foraging at a constant rate and below which foraging stops. To explain how foraging rates adjust to temperature and humidity, we propose that foragers modify their volatility after they leave the nest and become exposed to the environment. Our study highlights the importance of feedback in the regulation of foraging activity and shows how modulation of volatility can explain how foraging activity responds to conditions and varies across colonies. Our model elucidates the role of feedback across many timescales in collective behavior, and may be generalized to other systems driven by excitable dynamics, such as neuronal networks. © 2018 Pagliara et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",,"article; excitability; feedback system; forager; foraging behavior; humidity; modulation; nerve cell network; nonhuman; plant leaf; uncertainty; animal; animal behavior; animal communication; ant; biological model; computer simulation; feeding behavior; physiology; social behavior; temperature; Animal Communication; Animals; Ants; Behavior, Animal; Computer Simulation; Feeding Behavior; Humidity; Models, Biological; Social Behavior; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059274686

However, little is known about learner's perceptions of the agents or the relationship between the perceptions and learning. In this study, the authors revise the Agent Persona Instrument, a measurement tool designed to examine how learners perceive pedagogical agents. The factor structure of the revised instrument was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. Next, k-means clustering was used to examine how participants’ ratings on the instrument cluster into groups based on their perceptions of the virtual human. After describing the qualities of the clusters within the data, linear regression was used to examine to what extent the cluster membership influenced participant's scores on a transfer test of learning. The results indicated that cluster membership only explained a small amount of variance in transfer test scores. This study provides a revised instrument for measuring pedagogical agent persona. It implemented a novel method for investigating perceptions of pedagogical agents using k-means clustering which was able to identify two unique groups of participants based on their perceptions of the agent. Finally, it presents empirical results indicating that learner's perceptions of the agent had a small influence on their learning outcome scores. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agent persona instrument; API; Pedagogical agent; Persona effect; Virtual human","Computer aided instruction; Factor analysis; Learning systems; Virtual reality; Cluster memberships; Confirmatory factor analysis; Instrument clusters; K - means clustering; Multi-media learning; Pedagogical agents; Persona effect; Virtual humans; E-learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049725762

We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of information between brain regions from spike-train data commonly obtained in neurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in information theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one process to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated spike-train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring functional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the transfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of transfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before presenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle method, for spiketrain data that is split into multiple trials, determines significant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of neurons by comparing to a created baseline distribution using a rigorous statistical test. This is in contrast to either globally comparing all neuron transfer entropy values or comparing pairwise values to a single baseline value. In establishing the viability of this method by comparison to several alternative approaches in the literature, we find evidence that preserving the inter-spike-interval timing is important. We then use the trial-shuffle method to investigate information flow within a model network as we vary model parameters. This includes investigating the global flow of information within a connectivity network divided into two well-connected subnetworks, going beyond local transfer of information between pairs of neurons. © 2018 Walker, Newhall.",,"article; brain region; entropy; functional connectivity; information science; intermethod comparison; nerve cell; quantitative analysis; simulation; spike; biological model; brain; physiology; Brain; Entropy; Models, Neurological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056262674

A novel SPH formulation for modeling isothermally-incompressible fluids, which allows for the accurate simulation of thermally-driven, liquid-phase metal expansion/contraction, is presented and verified.

The physics of a track deposition process is explored through numerical experiments, and the influence of processing parameters on the quality of the finished melt-track is investigated.

The objective of this study was to evaluate climate change impacts on crop production and nitrate leaching in two distinct climatic zones in Canada. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was selected for the semiarid regions of Western Canada (Swift Current, SK) and maize (Zea mays L.) was chosen for the more humid regions of central Canada (Woodslee, ON). Climate scenarios were based upon simulations from a Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and crop simulations were conducted using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model. Compared to the baseline climate scenario, wheat yields increased by 8, 8, 11, 15%, whereas maize yields decreased by 15, 25, 22, 41% under RCP4.5 2050s (2041–2070), RCP4.5 2080s (2071–2100), RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s scenarios, respectively. Annual nitrate leaching increased by 19, 57, 73, 129% at Swift Current and by 84, 117, 208, 317% at Woodslee under the four scenarios, respectively. Adaptation measures suggested that fertilizer N rate for spring wheat should be increased to 80–100 kg N ha-1 to obtain optimal yields although this will result in an additional risk of 5–8 kg N ha-1 nitrate leaching at Swift Current. The fertilizer N rate of 150 kg N ha-1 was found to be suitable for high maize yields at Woodslee. New wheat and maize cultivars with long growing seasons would enable crop growth to match the phenological stage and hence maintain high crop yields to adapt to increased temperatures in the future. © 2018 He et al.

Adaptive stimulus-selection methods seek to select stimuli that are maximally informative about the PF given data observed so far in an experiment and thereby reduce the number of trials required to estimate the PF. Here we develop new adaptive stimulus-selection methods for flexible PF models in tasks with two or more alternatives. We model the PF with a multinomial logistic regression mixture model that incorporates realistic aspects of psychophysical behavior, including lapses and multiple alternatives for the response. We propose an information-theoretic criterion for stimulus selection and develop computationally efficient methods for inference and stimulus selection based on adaptive Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling.We apply these methods to data from macaque monkeys performing a multi-alternative motion-discrimination task and show in simulated experiments that our method can achieve a substantial speed-up over random designs. These advances will reduce the amount of data needed to build accurate models of multi-alternative PFs and can be extended to high-dimensional PFs that would be infeasible to characterize with standard methods. © 2018 The Authors.","Adaptive stimulus selection; Bayesian adaptive design; Closed-loop experiments; Psychometric function; Sequential optimal design","algorithm; animal; Macaca; Markov chain; Monte Carlo method; movement perception; physiology; psychological model; psychometry; psychophysics; statistical model; stimulus generalization; Algorithms; Animals; Generalization, Stimulus; Logistic Models; Macaca; Markov Chains; Models, Psychological; Monte Carlo Method; Motion Perception; Psychometrics; Psychophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056803448

We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the BG–PFC interplay. We propose that the BG bias PFC activity by removing the inhibition of cortico–thalamo–cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the PFC. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model’s predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the BG with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico–BG–cortical loops. © 2018 the authors.","Basal ganglia; Category learning; Computational model; Physiological data; Prefrontal cortex","article; corpus striatum; learning; nonhuman; prediction; prefrontal cortex; rhesus monkey; simulation; stimulus; teaching; animal; basal ganglion; classification; computer simulation; female; human; learning; nerve tract; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; procedures; theoretical model; Animals; Basal Ganglia; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Learning; Models, Theoretical; Neural Pathways; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055848007

National Ave, Springfield, MO  65897, United States","Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) is a special mobile ad hoc network that composed of facilities such as vehicle nodes and roadside units. Message transfer among vehicle nodes has been a great challenge due to the network’s highly variable topology and the selfish nature of vehicle nodes. Thus, it is very necessary to propose a mechanism to improve the cooperation among vehicle nodes to guarantee the effective message transmission. Currently, incentive-based cooperation mechanisms are commonly used to encourage nodes to participate in message transmission. Those mechanisms are based on traditional economics and generally assume that the decision-making behavior of nodes is completely independent. Also, the cooperation of nodes depends on whether the cooperation behavior can obtain the higher utility. But researches in behavioral economics have shown that due to the existence of altruistic reciprocity, the behavior of nodes is affected by not only their utility but also the behavioral motives of other nodes, so as to obtain different results from traditional incentive-based mechanisms. Therefore, the paper introduces the reciprocal altruistic from behavioral economics and proposes the reciprocal altruistic factor to reconstruct the utility function of nodes. The reconstructed utility function reflects the interaction of behavioral motives among nodes, which promotes the node’s cooperative behavior. Also, since the Network Formation Game (NFG) is a common mathematical model for studying the interaction and communication links formation among network nodes, hence the paper regards NFG in traditional economics as the research object. A Behavior Economics-based Message Transmission Cooperation Guarantee Mechanism named BMCGM is proposed, which motivates nodes to participate in the message transmission to reduce the transmission delay ratio. The simulation results show that the BMCGM reduces message transmission delay by at least 30.3% compared with the recent representative cooperation transmission mechanism. © 2018 by the authors.

An advantage of immersive virtual reality that has not been fully leveraged is that it can introduce transient visual perturbations on top of the visual environment being displayed. The goal of this study was to determine whether transient visual perturbations introduced in immersive virtual reality modify electrocortical activity and behavioral outcomes in human subjects practicing a novel balancing task during walking. We studied three groups of healthy young adults (5 male and 5 female for each) while they learned a balance beam walking task for 30 min under different conditions. Two groups trained while wearing a virtual reality headset, and one of those groups also had half-second visual rotation perturbations lasting ~10% of the training time. The third group trained without virtual reality. We recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and movement kinematics. We hypothesized that virtual reality training with perturbations would increase electrocortical activity and improve balance performance compared with virtual reality training without perturbations. Our results confirmed the hypothesis. Brief visual perturbations induced increased theta spectral power and decreased alpha spectral power in parietal and occipital regions and improved balance performance in posttesting. Our findings indicate that transient visual perturbations during immersive virtual reality training can boost short-term motor learning by inducing a cognitive change, minimizing the negative effects of virtual reality on motor training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that transient visual perturbations in virtual reality during balance training can boost short-term motor learning by inducing a cognitive change, overcoming the negative effects of immersive virtual reality. As a result, subjects training in immersive virtual reality with visual perturbations have equivalent performance improvement as training in real-world conditions. Visual perturbations elicited cortical responses in occipital and parietal regions and may have improved the brain’s ability to adapt to variations in sensory input. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

We showed that the method allowed children with motor impairments to improve at a 3D tracing task to become as proficient as typically developing children and that the training improved 2D figure copying. In this study, we expanded the training protocol to include a wider variety of ages (5–10-year-olds) and we made the figures traced in training the same as in figure copying, but varied the scale of training and copying figures to assess the generality of learning. Forty-eight children were assigned to groups trained using large or small figures. All were tested before training with a tracing task and a copying task. Then, the children trained over five sessions in the tracing task with either small or large figures. Finally, the tracing and copying tasks were tested again following training. A mean speed measure was used to control for path length variations in the timed task. Performance on both tasks at both baseline and posttest varied as a function of the size of the figure and age. In addition, tracing performance also varied with the level of support. In particular, speeds were higher with more support, larger figures and older children. After training, performance improved. Speeds increased. In tracing, performance improved more for large figures traced by children who trained on large figures. In copying, however, performance only improved significantly for children who had trained on small figures and it improved equally for large and small figures. In conclusion, training by tracing smaller figures yielded better learning that was not, however, specific to the scale of drawn figures. Small figures exhibit greater mean curvature. We infer that it yielded better general improvement. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Compliance control; Manual control; Motor development; Prospective control; Specificity","Article; Beery-Buktenica developmental test of visual-motor integration; child; comparative study; computer graphics; controlled study; drawing; female; handwriting; human; kindergarten; learning; male; Movement Assessment Battery for Children; preschool child; primary school; priority journal; school child; skill; training; velocity; virtual reality; age; analysis of variance; child development; compliance (physical); computer interface; depth perception; movement (physiology); perception; physiology; psychomotor performance; questionnaire; teaching; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Compliance; Computer Graphics; Depth Perception; Female; Humans; Male; Movement; Psychomotor Performance; Size Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Teaching; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049095330

The objective of this paper is to profile the evolutionary development, performance metrics, and satisfaction queries of this innovative effort. Methods: Sixty-one high school students, grades 9–12, took part in the (SMMS) program during the 2015 SAGES Annual Congress. The students completed a surgical skills lab session where they attempted tasks associated with the development of open surgical and laparoscopic skills. The lab included a warm-up with the validated Super Monkey Ball video game, Top Gun Pea Drop task, FLS Peg Transfer task, open knot tying station, and open instrument tie station. Results: The following are the results of the surgical skills lab. For the Super Monkey Ball task, 60 students participated with an average score of 73.0 s (SD = 53.9; range 59.1–87.0; median = 74). Sixty students participated in the Surgeons Knot and Pea Drop tasks with average times of 26.6 s (SD = 19.3; range 21.7–31.6; median = 21.0) and 113.8 s (SD = 65.9; range 96.6–131.0; median = 101.0), respectively. Sixty students participated in the Instrument Tie and 56 students participated in the Peg Transfer stations with average times of 51.7 s (SD = 34.5; range 42.8–60.6; median = 39.5) and 173.1 s (SD = 25.0; range 166.4–179.8; median = 180.0), respectively. 51 (83.6%) agreed that the Mini Med School made them more likely to consider a career in medicine. When asked if the program made them more likely to consider a career in surgery 42 (68.8%) agreed. All 61 respondents (100%) said that they would recommend the program to others. Conclusions: The SMMS program showed that the students had an excellent aptitude for the performance of validated surgical subtasks with high satisfaction, and increased consideration of a career in medicine/surgery. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the impact on workforce recruitment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Career choice; High school; Pipeline; Premedical; Surgical education; Surgical skills","academic achievement; Article; decision making; education program; educational status; female; high school student; human; laparoscopy; male; open surgery; priority journal; school; self report; student satisfaction; surgical training; video game; adolescent; clinical competence; education; general surgery; mentoring; United States; Adolescent; Career Choice; Clinical Competence; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Mentoring; Schools; United States; Video Games",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044726550

For spike train models of individual neurons, many goodness-of-fit measures rely on the time-rescaling theorem and assess model quality using rescaled spike times. Recently, there has been increasing interest in statistical models that describe the simultaneous spiking activity of neuron populations, either in a single brain region or across brain regions. Classically, such models have used spike sorted data to describe relationships between the identified neurons, but more recently clusterless modeling methods have been used to describe population activity using a single model. Here we develop a generalization of the time-rescaling theorem that enables comprehensive goodness-of-fit analysis for either of these classes of population models. We use the theory of marked point processes to model population spiking activity, and show that under the correct model, each spike can be rescaled individually to generate a uniformly distributed set of events in time and the space of spike marks. After rescaling, multiple well-established goodness-of-fit procedures and statistical tests are available. We demonstrate the application of these methods both to simulated data and real population spiking in rat hippocampus.

Although some clinical studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms involved in these practices, an extensive study from an engineering point of view has not yet been conducted. Herein, we aim to identify the key parameters in the needle-free injection process and study their effects on microjet characteristics. The total stagnation pressure of an impinging microjet determines the penetration capabilities of the injection and is monitored with the aid of both experimental and computational tools employed on a typical commercial injector. Our findings indicated that the filling ratio and driving pressure had significant impacts on the peak and average stagnation pressures of the impinging microjet. Furthermore, the penetration characteristics of a standard nozzle and injection fluid could be controlled by an effective combination of the filling level and driving pressure, and thus, they can be considered as vital parameters when performing skin remodeling procedures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational fluid dynamics simulation; Fluid-tissue interaction; Microjet; Needle-free injection; Skin scar treatment; Stagnation pressure","Computational fluid dynamics; Controlled drug delivery; Needles; Targeted drug delivery; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Computational tools; Invasive drug delivery; Micro-jet; Penetration characteristic; Stagnation pressures; Tissue interactions; Treatment techniques; Jets; polyacrylamide gel; Article; computational fluid dynamics; dispersion; energy transfer; friction; geometry; mechanical stress; mechanics; pressure; priority journal; skin penetration; skin scar; skin surface; velocity; viscosity; computer simulation; devices; drug delivery system; human; hydrodynamics; procedures; scar; skin; theoretical model; Cicatrix; Computer Simulation; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Models, Theoretical; Pressure; Skin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051386876

Closed-loop electrical brain stimulation systems may enable a precisely-tailored treatment for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders by controlling the stimulation based on neural activity feedback in real time. Developing model-based closed-loop systems requires a principled system identification framework to quantify the effect of input stimulation on output neural activity by learning an input-output (IO) dynamic model from data. Further, developing these systems needs a realistic clinical simulation testbed to design and validate the closed-loop controllers derived from the IO models before testing in human patients. Approach. First, we design a control-theoretic system identification framework to build dynamic IO models for neural activity that are amenable to closed-loop control design. To enable tractable model-based control, we use a data-driven linear state-space IO model that characterizes the effect of input on neural activity in terms of a low-dimensional hidden neural state. To learn the model parameters, we design a novel input waveform - a pulse train modulated by stochastic binary noise (BN) parameters - that we show is optimal for collecting informative IO datasets in system identification and conforms to clinical safety requirements. Second, we further extend this waveform to a generalized BN (GBN)-modulated waveform to reduce the required system identification time. Third, to enable extensive testing of system identification and closed-loop control, we develop a real-time closed-loop clinical hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation testbed using the microelectrode recording and stimulation device, which incorporates stochastic noises, unknown disturbances and stimulation artifacts. Using this testbed, we implement both the system identification and the closed-loop controller by taking control of mood in depression as an example. Results. Testbed simulation results show that the closed-loop controller designed from IO models identified with the BN-modulated waveform achieves tight control, and performs similar to a controller that knows the true IO model of neural activity. When system identification time is limited, performance is further improved using the GBN-modulated waveform. Significance. The system identification framework with the new BN-modulated waveform and the clinical HIL simulation testbed can help develop future model-based closed-loop electrical brain stimulation systems for treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain stimulation; closed-loop control; neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders; system identification","analytical parameters; Article; brain computer interface; brain depth stimulation; brain function; computer simulation; conceptual framework; control theoretic system identification framework; controlled study; electroencephalogram; human; mental disease; mood disorder; neurologic disease; nonhuman; priority journal; pulse rate; real time closed-loop clinical simulation; steady state; stochastic binary noise; waveform; affect; algorithm; artifact; biological model; brain; brain depth stimulation; computer simulation; computer system; depression; electrostimulation; Markov chain; microelectrode; Monte Carlo method; physiology; procedures; psychology; Affect; Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Computer Simulation; Computer Systems; Deep Brain Stimulation; Depression; Electric Stimulation; Humans; Microelectrodes; Models, Neurological; Monte Carlo Method; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056657752

We created two “serious” video game training interventions to improve that judgment. The interventions’ central theoretical construct was the representativeness heuristic, which, in trauma triage, would mean judging the severity of an injury by how well it captures (or “represents”) the key features of archetypes of cases requiring transfer to a trauma center. Drawing on clinical experience, medical records, and an expert panel, we identified features characteristic of representative and nonrepresentative cases. The two interventions instantiated both kinds of cases. One was an adventure game, seeking narrative engagement; the second was a puzzle-based game, emphasizing analogical reasoning. Both incorporated feedback on diagnostic errors, explaining their sources and consequences. In a four-arm study, they were compared with an intervention using traditional text-based continuing medical education materials (active control) and a no-intervention (passive control) condition. A sample of 320 physicians working at nontrauma centers in the United States was recruited and randomized to a study arm. The primary outcome was performance on a validated virtual simulation, measured as the proportion of undertriaged patients, defined as ones who had severe injuries (according to American College of Surgeons guidelines) but were not transferred. Compared with the control group, physicians exposed to either game undertriaged fewer such patients [difference = −18%, 95% CI: −30 to −6%, P = 0.002 (adventure game); −17%, 95% CI: −28 to −6%, P = 0.003 (puzzle game)]; those exposed to the text-based education undertriaged similar proportions (difference = +8%, 95% CI: −3 to +19%, P = 0.15). © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Very few methodologies exist for the joint analysis of replicated ChIP-seq data, with approaches ranging from combining the results of analyzing replicates individually to joint modeling of all replicates. Combining the results of individual replicates analyzed separately can lead to reduced peak classification performance compared to joint modeling. Currently available methods for joint analysis may fail to control the false discovery rate at the nominal level. Results: We propose BinQuasi, a peak caller for replicated ChIP-seq data, that jointly models biological replicates using a generalized linear model framework and employs a one-sided quasilikelihood ratio test to detect peaks. When applied to simulated data and real datasets, BinQuasi performs favorably compared to existing methods, including better control of false discovery rate than existing joint modeling approaches. BinQuasi offers a flexible approach to joint modeling of replicated ChIP-seq data which is preferable to combining the results of replicates analyzed individually.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","Background: The study of learning in populations of subjects can provide insights into the changes that occur in the brain with aging, drug intervention, and psychiatric disease. New method: We introduce a separable two-dimensional (2D) random field (RF) model for analyzing binary response data acquired during the learning of object-reward associations across multiple days. The method can quantify the variability of performance within a day and across days, and can capture abrupt changes in learning. Results: We apply the method to data from young and aged macaque monkeys performing a reversal-learning task. The method provides an estimate of performance within a day for each age group, and a learning rate across days for each monkey. We find that, as a group, the older monkeys require more trials to learn the object discriminations than do the young monkeys, and that the cognitive flexibility of the younger group is higher. We also use the model estimates of performance as features for clustering the monkeys into two groups. The clustering results in two groups that, for the most part, coincide with those formed by the age groups. Simulation studies suggest that clustering captures inter-individual differences in performance levels. Comparison with existing method(s): In comparison with generalized linear models, this method is better able to capture the inherent two-dimensional nature of the data and find between group differences. Conclusions: Applied to binary response data from groups of individuals performing multi-day behavioral experiments, the model discriminates between-group differences and identifies subgroups. © 2018 The Authors","Aging; Bayesian inference; Behavior; Change-point test; EM algorithm; Gibbs sampling; Laplace prior; Learning; MAP estimation; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Reversal learning task; Separable random field model","animal experiment; Article; controlled study; female; groups by age; learning; Macaca; nonhuman; priority journal; reversal learning; reward; simulation; task performance; aging; animal; cognition; Markov chain; nonlinear system; perceptive discrimination; physiology; rhesus monkey; Aging; Animals; Cognition; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Macaca mulatta; Markov Chains; Nonlinear Dynamics; Reversal Learning; Reward",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049610929

In this paper, we analyze and characterize the interference between MPI and I/O traffic on fat-tree networks, highlighting the role of important factors such as message sizes, communication intervals, and job sizes. We also investigate several strategies for reducing MPI-I/O interference, and the benefits and tradeoffs of each approach for different scenarios. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Fat-tree; I/O; Interference; MPI; Network; Simulation","Data transfer; Forestry; Networks (circuits); Wave interference; Fat trees; Job size; MPI-I/O; Network congestions; Network resource; Performance bottlenecks; Simulation; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054787627

Evaluations of vision prostheses and sensory substitution devices have frequently relied on repeated training and then testing with the same small set of items. These multiple forced-choice tasks produced above chance performance in blind users, but it is unclear if the observed performance represents restoration of vision that transfers to novel, untrained items. Approach. Here, we tested the generalizability of the forced-choice paradigm on discrimination of low-resolution word images. Extensive visual training was conducted with the same 10 words used in previous BrainPort tongue stimulation studies. The performance on these 10 words and an additional 50 words was measured before and after the training sessions. Main results. The results revealed minimal performance improvement with the untrained words, demonstrating instead pattern discrimination limited mostly to the trained words. Significance. These findings highlight the need to reconsider current evaluation practices, in particular, the use of forced-choice paradigms with a few highly trained items. While appropriate for measuring the performance thresholds in acuity or contrast sensitivity of a functioning visual system, performance on such tasks cannot be taken to indicate restored spatial pattern vision. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","object recognition; pattern discrimination; prosthetic vision evaluation; vision rehabilitation","Object recognition; Restoration; Contrast sensitivity; Pattern discrimination; Performance improvements; Prosthetic vision; Sensory substitution; Training sessions; Vision prosthesis; Vision rehabilitation; Prosthetics; accuracy; adolescent; adult; Article; contrast sensitivity; female; forced choice method; human; multiple choice test; nonhuman; normal human; priority journal; reaction time; simulation; visual discrimination; word recognition; automated pattern recognition; perceptive discrimination; physiology; prosthesis design; psychomotor performance; reading; recognition; visual acuity; visual prosthesis; Contrast Sensitivity; Discrimination (Psychology); Humans; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prosthesis Design; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Reading; Recognition (Psychology); Visual Acuity; Visual Prosthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053127000

As the dapivirine vaginal ring moves forward through regulatory review and open-label extension studies, the potential public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this new prevention method are not fully known. We used mathematical modeling to explore the impact and cost-effectiveness of the ring in different implementation scenarios alongside scale-up of other HIV prevention interventions. Given the knowledge gaps about key factors influencing the ring’s implementation, including potential uptake and delivery costs, we engaged in a stakeholder consultation process to elicit plausible parameter ranges and explored scenarios to identify the possible range of impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness. Methods and findings We used the Goals model to simulate scenarios of oral and ring pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation among female sex workers and among other women 21 years or >21 years with multiple male partners, in Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. In these scenarios, we varied antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, dapivirine ring coverage and ring effectiveness (encompassing efficacy and adherence) by risk group. Following discussions with stakeholders, the maximum level of PrEP coverage (oral and/or ring) considered in each country was equal to modern contraception use minus condom use in the two age groups. We assessed results for 18 years, from 2018 to 2035. In South Africa, for example, the HIV infections averted by PrEP (ring plus oral PrEP) ranged from 310,000 under the highest-impact scenario (including ART held constant at 2017 levels, high ring coverage, and 85% ring effectiveness) to 55,000 under the lowest-impact scenario (including ART reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets by 2020, low ring coverage, and 30% ring effectiveness). This represented a range of 6.4% to 2.2% of new HIV infections averted. Given our assumptions, the addition of the ring results in 11% to 132% more impact than oral PrEP alone. The cost per HIV infection averted for the ring ranged from US$13,000 to US$121,000. Conclusions This analysis offers a wide range of scenarios given the considerable uncertainty over ring uptake, consistency of use, and effectiveness, as well as HIV testing, prevention, and treatment use over the next two decades. This could help inform donors and implementers as they decide where to allocate resources in order to maximize the impact of the dapivirine ring in light of funding and implementation constraints. Better understanding of the cost and potential uptake of the intervention would improve our ability to estimate its cost-effectiveness and assess where it can have the most impact. © 2019 Reidy et al.

There is evidence that T-cells achieve this remarkable performance utilizing a network architecture based on a generalization of kinetic proofreading (KPR). KPR-based mechanisms actively consume energy to increase the specificity beyond what is possible in equilibrium. An important theoretical question that arises is to understand the trade-offs and fundamental limits on accuracy, speed, and dissipation (energy consumption) in KPR and its generalization. Here, we revisit this question through numerical simulations where we simultaneously measure the speed, accuracy, and energy consumption of the KPR and adaptive sorting networks for different parameter choices. Our simulations highlight the existence of a “feasible operating regime” in the speed-energy-accuracy plane where T-cells can quickly differentiate between foreign and self ligands at reasonable energy expenditure. We give general arguments for why we expect this feasible operating regime to be a generic property of all KPR-based biochemical networks and discuss implications for our understanding of the T cell receptor circuit. © 2018 Cui, Mehta.

Although several different types of learning have been successfully modeled using a universal computer, in general, learning cannot be described by an algorithm. In other words, algorithmic approach to describing the functioning of biological systems is not sufficient for adequate grasping of what is life. Since biosystems are parts of the physical world, one might hope that adding some physical mechanisms and principles to the concept of algorithm could provide extra possibilities for describing learning in its full generality. However, a straightforward approach to that through the so-called physical hypercomputation so far has not been successful. Here an alternative approach is proposed. Biosystems are described as achieving enumeration of possible physical compositions though random incremental modifications inflicted on them by active operating resources (AORs) in the environment. Biosystems learn through algorithmic regulation of the intensity of the above modifications according to a specific optimality criterion. From the perspective of external observers, biosystems move in the space of different algorithms driven by random modifications imposed by the environmental AORs. A particular algorithm is only a snapshot of that motion, while the motion itself is essentially trans-algorithmic. In this conceptual framework, death of unfit members of a population, for example, is viewed as a trans-algorithmic modification made in the population as a biosystem by environmental AORs. Numerous examples of AOR utilization in biosystems of different complexity, from viruses to multicellular organisms, are provided. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Active operating resource; Kinetic force principle; Mutation rate; Optimization; Physical computability; Stability","Biological systems; Convergence of numerical methods; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Active operating resource; Algorithmic approach; Conceptual frameworks; Multicellular organisms; Mutation rates; Non-stationary environment; Particular algorithms; Physical computability; Bioinformatics; algorithm; biological model; computer simulation; creativity; human; learning; physical phenomena; systems biology; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Creativity; Humans; Learning; Models, Biological; Physical Phenomena; Systems Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049966503

The integration of viruses into the human genome is associated with multiple cancers, and these can now be detected using next-generation sequencing methods such as whole genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing. Results: We designed a novel computational workflow, HGT-ID, to identify the integration of viruses into the human genome using the sequencing data. The HGT-ID workflow primarily follows a four-step procedure: i) pre-processing of unaligned reads, ii) virus detection using subtraction approach, iii) identification of virus integration site using discordant and soft-clipped reads and iv) HGT candidates prioritization through a scoring function. Annotation and visualization of the events, as well as primer design for experimental validation, are also provided in the final report. We evaluated the tool performance with the well-understood cervical cancer samples. The HGT-ID workflow accurately detected known human papillomavirus (HPV) integration sites with high sensitivity and specificity compared to previous HGT methods. We applied HGT-ID to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-genome sequencing data (WGS) from liver tumor-normal pairs. Multiple hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration sites were identified in TCGA liver samples and confirmed by HGT-ID using the RNA-Seq data from the matched liver pairs. This shows the applicability of the method in both the data types and cross-validation of the HGT events in liver samples. We also processed 220 breast tumor WGS data through the workflow; however, there were no HGT events detected in those samples. Conclusions: HGT-ID is a novel computational workflow to detect the integration of viruses in the human genome using the sequencing data. It is fast and accurate with functions such as prioritization, annotation, visualization and primer design for future validation of HGTs.

Here, we present and benchmark Galene, a versatile multi-platform software tool for image-based correction of sample motion blurring in both time resolved and conventional laser scanning fluorescence microscopy data in two and three dimensions. We show that Galene is able to resolve intravital FLIM-FRET images of intra-abdominal organs in murine models and NADH autofluorescence of human dermal tissue imaging subject to a wide range of physiological motions. Thus, Galene can enable FLIM imaging in situations where a stable imaging platform is not always possible and rescue previously discarded quantitative imaging data. © Warren et al.",,"isoflurane; scopolamine; guanosine triphosphate; neuropeptide; protein tyrosine kinase; Rac1 protein; Rac1 protein, mouse; algorithm; amplitude modulation; Article; autofluorescence imaging; biological activity; blurred vision; breathing rate; calculation; clinical chemistry; clinical evaluation; comparative study; conceptual framework; controlled study; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; fluorescence; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; frequency analysis; functional magnetic resonance imaging; health care planning; histogram; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunology; in vivo study; intravital microscopy; karyotype; magnitude estimation method; Monte Carlo method; morphology; nonhuman; performance; peristalsis; physiological feedback; process optimization; quantitative analysis; rock; anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; cell adhesion; computer simulation; fluorescence microscopy; genetic procedures; human; intestine; metabolism; metastasis; motion; mouse; pancreas tumor; pathology; physiology; skin; software; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Animals; Biosensing Techniques; Cell Adhesion; Computer Simulation; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Guanosine Triphosphate; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Intestines; Intravital Microscopy; Mice; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Models, Biological; Motion; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neuropeptides; Pancreatic Neoplasms; rac1 GTP-Binding Protein; Skin; Software; src-Family Kinases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052062668

Conventionally, a time-consuming and laborious training procedure is performed on each new user to collect sufficient individualized data, hindering the applications of BCIs on monitoring brain states (e.g. drowsiness) in real-world settings. This study proposes applying hierarchical clustering to assess the inter- and intra-subject variability within a large-scale dataset of EEG collected in a simulated driving task, and validates the feasibility of transferring EEG-based drowsiness-detection models across subjects. A subject-transfer framework is thus developed for detecting drowsiness based on a large-scale model pool from other subjects and a small amount of alert baseline calibration data from a new user. The model pool ensures the availability of positive model transferring, whereas the alert baseline data serve as a selector of decoding models in the pool. Compared with the conventional within-subject approach, the proposed framework remarkably reduced the required calibration time for a new user by 90% (18.00 min–1.72 ± 0.36 min) without compromising performance (p = 0.0910) when sufficient existing data are available. These findings suggest a practical pathway toward plug-and-play drowsiness detection and can ignite numerous real-world BCI applications. © 2018","Brain-computer interface (BCI); Drowsiness; EEG baseline; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA); Subject-transfer decoding","Article; attention test; brain computer interface; car driving; cluster analysis; drowsiness; electroencephalography; hierarchical cluster analysis; human; human experiment; normal human; priority journal; simulation; virtual reality; brain; calibration; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; signal processing; wakefulness; Brain; Brain Waves; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Calibration; Cluster Analysis; Electroencephalography; Humans; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044567738

Conventionally, magnetization transfer ratio with asymmetric analysis (MTRasym) has been used to quantify the APT effect. However, some studies indicate that MTRasym is contaminated by water longitudinal relaxation time (T1w), and thus it is necessary to normalize T1w in MTRasym to obtain specific quantification of the APT effect. So far, whether to use MTRasym or the T1w-normalized MTRasym is still under debate in the field. In this paper, the influence of T1w on the quantification of APT was evaluated through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and phantom studies for different experimental conditions. Results indicate that there are two types of T1w effect (T1w recovery and T1w-related saturation), which have inverse influences on the steady-state MTRasym. In situations with no or weak direct water saturation (DS) effect, there is only the T1w recovery effect, and MTRasym linearly depends on T1w. In contrast, in situations with significant DS effects, the dependence of MTRasym on T1w is complex, and is dictated by the competition of these two T1w effects. Therefore, by choosing appropriate irradiation powers, MTRasym could be roughly insensitive to T1w. Moreover, in non-steady-state acquisitions with very short irradiation time, MTRasym is also roughly insensitive to T1w. Therefore, for steady-state APT imaging at high fields or with very low irradiation powers, where there are no significant DS effects, it is necessary to normalize T1w to improve the specificity of MTRasym. However, in clinical MRI systems (usually low fields or non-steady-state acquisitions), T1w normalization may not be necessary when appropriate sequence parameters are chosen.

This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. Methods We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. Results Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence. Conclusions Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children. Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home. © 2018 Adler et al.

Since most of these devices are powered by batteries, a fundamental trade-off to be addressed is the depleted energy and the achieved data throughput in wireless data transmission. By exploiting the rate-adaptive capacities of wireless devices, most existing works on energy-efficient data transmission try to design rate-adaptive transmission policies to maximize the amount of transmitted data bits under the energy constraints of devices. Such solutions, however, cannot apply to scenarios where data packets have respective deadlines and only integrally transmitted data packets contribute. Thus, this paper introduces a notion of weighted throughput, which measures how much total value of data packets are successfully and integrally transmitted before their own deadlines. By designing efficient rate-adaptive transmission policies, this paper aims to make the best use of the energy and maximize the weighted throughput. What is more challenging but with practical significance, we consider the fading effect of wireless channels in both offline and online scenarios. In the offline scenario, we develop an optimal algorithm that computes the optimal solution in pseudo-polynomial time, which is the best possible solution as the problem undertaken is NP-hard. In the online scenario, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm based on optimal properties derived for the optimal offline solution. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2018 by the authors.

However, as a result of both cardiac and respiratory motion, only one two-dimensional T1 map can be acquired in one breath-hold with most current techniques, which limits its application for whole heart evaluation in routine clinical practice. In this study, an electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered three-dimensional Look–Locker method was developed for cardiac T1 measurement. Fast three-dimensional data acquisition was achieved with a spoiled gradient-echo sequence in combination with a stack-of-spirals trajectory and through-time non-Cartesian generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) acceleration. The effects of different magnetic resonance parameters on T1 quantification with the proposed technique were first examined by simulating data acquisition and T1 map reconstruction using Bloch equation simulations. Accuracy was evaluated in studies with both phantoms and healthy subjects. These results showed that there was close agreement between the proposed technique and the reference method for a large range of T1 values in phantom experiments. In vivo studies further demonstrated that rapid cardiac T1 mapping for 12 three-dimensional partitions (spatial resolution, 2 × 2 × 8 mm3) could be achieved in a single breath-hold of ~12 s. The mean T1 values of myocardial tissue and blood obtained from normal volunteers at 3 T were 1311 ± 66 and 1890 ± 159 ms, respectively. In conclusion, a three-dimensional T1 mapping technique was developed using a non-Cartesian parallel imaging method, which enables fast and accurate T1 mapping of cardiac tissues in a single short breath-hold.

Contrary to the experience in laparoscopy, simulator training for robotic surgery is not widely employed partly because robotic surgical simulators are expensive. We sought to determine the effect of a robotic simulation curriculum and whether robotic surgical skills could be derived from those psychomotor skills attained in laparoscopic training. Methods: Twenty-seven trainees with no prior robotic experience and limited laparoscopy exposure were randomly assigned to one of three training groups: no simulator training, training on a fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS™) standard box trainer, and training on a robotic computer based simulator (da Vinci Skills Simulator™). Baseline robotic surgical skills were assessed on the clinical robot docked to a standard FLS trainer box on two tasks—intracorporeal knot tying and peg transfer. Subjects subsequently underwent four 1-h long training sessions in their assigned training environment over a course of several weeks. Robotic surgical skills were reassessed on the robot on the same two tasks used to assess skills prior to training. Results: FLS training resulted in a greater score improvement than no training for both knot and peg scores. FLS training was also determined to result in greater score improvement than robotic simulator training for knot tying. There was no significant difference in peg transfer or knot tying scores when comparing robotic simulator training and no training. Conclusions: Robotic surgical skills can be in part derived from psychomotor skills developed in a laparoscopic trainer, especially for complex skills such as intracorporeal knot tying. Acquisition of robotic surgical skills may be enhanced by practice on a laparoscopic simulator using the FLS curriculum. This may be especially helpful when a robotic simulator is not available or is poorly accessible. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Laparoscopy; Randomized controlled trial; Robotic surgical procedures; Robotics; Simulation training","adult; Article; curriculum; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; priority journal; psychomotor performance; robot assisted surgery; simulation; skill; surgical training; clinical competence; controlled study; education; general surgery; laparoscopy; medical education; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; robotic surgical procedure; simulation training; United States; Adult; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Prospective Studies; Psychomotor Performance; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037165925

One hypothesis, supported experimentally, is that some symptoms of these disorders are associated with pathological synchronization of neurons in the basal ganglia and thalamus. For this reason, there has been interest in recent years in finding efficient ways to desynchronize neurons that are both fast-acting and low-power. Recent results on coordinated reset and periodically forced oscillators suggest that forming distinct clusters of neurons may prove to be more effective than achieving complete desynchronization, in particular by promoting plasticity effects that might persist after stimulation is turned off. Current proposed methods for achieving clustering frequently require either multiple input sources or precomputing the control signal. We propose here a control strategy for clustering, based on an analysis of the reduced phase model for a set of identical neurons, that allows for real-time, single-input control of a population of neurons with low-amplitude, low total energy signals. After demonstrating its effectiveness on phase models, we apply it to full state models to demonstrate its validity. We also discuss the effects of coupling on the efficacy of the strategy proposed and demonstrate that the clustering can still be accomplished in the presence of weak to moderate electrotonic coupling. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Clustering; Coupling; Neural oscillators; Parkinson’s; Phase models","action potential amplitude; Article; cluster analysis; control strategy; current amplitude; energy transfer; firing rate; membrane stabilization; nerve cell membrane; nerve cell plasticity; nerve conduction; nerve stimulation; oscillatory potential; priority journal; signal transduction; simulation; stimulus response; validity; animal; biological model; brain; computer simulation; cytology; human; nerve cell; physiology; time factor; Animals; Brain; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044741547

Vocal fold vibration is driven by pressures on the vocal fold surface, which are determined by the shape of the glottis and the contact between vocal folds. Characterization of three-dimensional glottal shapes and contact patterns can lead to increased understanding of normal and abnormal physiology of the voice, as well as to development of improved vocal fold models, but a large inventory of shapes has not been directly studied previously. This study aimed to take an initial step toward characterizing vocal fold contact patterns systematically. Vocal fold motion and contact was modeled based on normal mode vibration, as it has been shown that vocal fold vibration can be almost entirely described by only the few lowest order vibrational modes. Symmetric and asymmetric combinations of the four lowest normal modes of vibration were superimposed on left and right vocal fold medial surfaces, for each of three prephonatory glottal configurations, according to a surface wave approach. Contact patterns were generated from the interaction of modal shapes at 16 normalized phases during the vibratory cycle.

To assess the existence of these zones and their interaction, we characterized the resonance properties of a biophysically-realistic compartmental model of a neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neuron. Consistent with recently published theoretical and empirical findings, our model was configured to have a “hot zone” in distal apical dendrite and apical tuft where both high-and low-threshold Ca2+ ionic conductances had densities 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the apical dendrite. We simulated injection of broad spectrum sinusoidal currents with linearly increasing frequency to calculate the input impedance of individual compartments, the transfer impedance between the soma and key compartments within the dendritic tree, anda dimensionless termwe introduce called resonance quality. We show that input resonance analysis distinguished at least four distinct zones within the model based on properties of their frequency preferences: basal dendrite which displayed little resonance; soma/proximal apical dendrite which displayed resonance at 5–23Hz, strongest at 5–10Hz and hyperpolarized/resting membrane potentials; distal apical dendrite which displayed resonance at 8–19Hz, strongest at 10Hz and depolarized membrane potentials; and apical tuft which displayed a weak resonance largely between 8 and 10Hz across a wide range of membrane potentials. Transfer resonance analysis revealed that changes in subthreshold electrical coupling were found to modulate the transfer resonant frequency of signals transmitted from distal apical dendrite and apical tuft to the soma, which would impact the frequencies that individual neurons are expected to respond to and reinforce. Furthermore, eliminating the hot zone was found to reduce amplification of resonance within the model, which contributes to reduced excitability when perisomatic and distal apical regions receive coincident stimulating current injections. These results indicate that the interactions between different functional zones should be considered in a more complete understanding of neuronal integration. Resonance analysis may therefore be a useful tool for assessing the integration of inputs across the entire neuronal membrane. © 2018 Felton, Yu, Boothe, Oie and Franaszczuk.","Association; Electrical coupling; Functional division; Ionic conductance; Layer 5 pyramidal neuron; Resonance","Association reactions; Integral equations; Integration; Membranes; Natural frequencies; Resonance; Electrical coupling; Functional division; Membrane characteristics; Membrane potentials; Orders of magnitude; Pyramidal neuron; Sinusoidal currents; Synaptic integration; Neurons; action potential; analysis; apical tuft; Article; basal dendrite; compartment model; dendrite; distal apical dendrite; feedback system; input resonance analysis; membrane potential; neocortex; oscillation; positive feedback; proximal apical dendrite; pyramidal nerve cell; subthreshold oscillation; transfer resonance analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049502669

Design: Prospective crossover study. Setting: Multidisciplinary simulation center and motion analysis laboratory, Mayo Clinic. Participants: Novices were medical students and surgical interns without laparoscopic experience. Experts were surgeons with at least 3 years of experience in laparoscopic surgery. Methods: This was the first exposure to iPT for both groups. Completion time and performance metrics were recorded. A scoring rubric was used to calculate a normalized performance score between 0 and 100. Wilcoxon rank sum and Mann-Whitney tests were performed with α = 0.05. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were graphed for the 2 task scores to assess the tasks’ sensitivity and specificity in differentiating laparoscopic experience level. Main Outcome Measures: Performance measures of completion time, transferred triangles, dropped triangles (errors), and the overall performance score on both tasks between- and within-subjects (i.e., novices and experts). Results: Thirty-six novices and eight experts participated. Both experts and novices had longer completion time and lower scores during iPT than rPT (p < 0.05). Within iPT, novice completion times were 144 seconds longer (p = 0.04), and performance score was 35 points lower than experts (p < 0.01). No differences between novices and experts were observed for completion time or performance scores (p > 0.05) for rPT. The iPT scores had a higher sensitivity and specificity than the rPT (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: iPT = 0.91; rPT = 0.69). Conclusions: iPT is a valid assessment of advanced laparoscopic skills for surgical trainees with higher specificity and sensitivity than rPT. As advanced minimally invasive surgery becomes more common, it is important that tasks such as iPT be included in surgical simulation curricula and training assessment. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","assessment; in situ simulation; motor skill; Patient Care; sensitivity analysis; validation study","Article; crossover procedure; effect size; experience; female; human; inverted peg transfer; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopy; male; medical expert; medical practice; medical student; performance measurement system; priority journal; rank sum test; receiver operating characteristic; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; simulation training; skill; surgeon; surgical training; task performance; validation study; adult; clinical competence; comparative study; education; general surgery; laparoscope; motor performance; nonparametric test; operation duration; procedures; prospective study; simulation training; task performance; Adult; Clinical Competence; Cross-Over Studies; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Laparoscopes; Laparoscopy; Male; Motor Skills; Operative Time; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Simulation Training; Statistics, Nonparametric; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031316139

Results from several decades of studying this phenomenon have culminated in recent years in various promising attempts to decode the attentional state of a listener in a competing-speaker environment from non-invasive neuroimaging recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, most existing approaches compute correlation-based measures by either regressing the features of each speech stream to the M/EEG channels (the decoding approach) or vice versa (the encoding approach). To produce robust results, these procedures require multiple trials for training purposes. Also, their decoding accuracy drops significantly when operating at high temporal resolutions. Thus, they are not well-suited for emerging real-time applications such as smart hearing aid devices or brain-computer interface systems, where training data might be limited and high temporal resolutions are desired. In this paper, we close this gap by developing an algorithmic pipeline for real-time decoding of the attentional state. Our proposed framework consists of three main modules: (1) Real-time and robust estimation of encoding or decoding coefficients, achieved by sparse adaptive filtering, (2) Extracting reliable markers of the attentional state, and thereby generalizing the widely-used correlation-based measures thereof, and (3) Devising a near real-time state-space estimator that translates the noisy and variable attention markers to robust and statistically interpretable estimates of the attentional state with minimal delay. Our proposed algorithms integrate various techniques including forgetting factor-based adaptive filtering,ℓ1-regularization, forward-backward splitting algorithms, fixed-lag smoothing, and Expectation Maximization. We validate the performance of our proposed framework using comprehensive simulations as well as application to experimentally acquired M/EEG data. Our results reveal that the proposed real-time algorithms perform nearly as accurately as the existing state-of-the-art offline techniques, while providing a significant degree of adaptivity, statistical robustness, and computational savings. © 2018 Miran, Akram, Sheikhattar, Simon, Zhang and Babadi.","Attention; Auditory; Bayesian filtering; Dynamic estimation; EEG; MEG; Real-time; State-space models","Article; auditory discrimination; auditory stimulation; Bayes theorem; controlled study; electroencephalography; human; learning algorithm; magnetoencephalography; mathematical computing; mathematical model; neuroimaging; process model; selective attention; speech analysis; speech perception; stimulus response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046636735

Our present experiments demonstrate the efficacy of such training using a first-person perspective movement videogame-based platform in samples of students and Soldiers. Effectiveness was assessed by manipulating KR during a training phase and withdrawing it in a subsequent transfer phase. Relative to a no KR control condition, KR systematically improved performance for both Soldiers and students. These results build upon our previous findings that demonstrated that a video game-based platform can be used to create a movement-centred sustained attention task with important elements of traditional vigilance. The results indicate that KR effects in sustained attention extend to a first person perspective movement based paradigm, and that these effects occur in professional military as well as a more general population. Such sustained attention training can save lives and the present findings demonstrate one particular avenue to achieve this goal.

These processes are not generally observable but are inferred from their collective influence on behavior. Is there a robust way to uncover the hidden processes? A standard approach is to consider a state space model where the hidden states change following experience of error and then fit the model to the measured data by minimizing the squared error between measurement and model prediction. We found that this least-squares algorithm (LMSE) often yielded unrealistic predictions about the hidden states, possibly because of its neglect of the stochastic nature of error-based learning. We found that behavioral data during adaptation was better explained by a system in which both error-based learning and movement production were stochastic processes. To uncover the hidden states of learning, we developed a generalized expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In simulation, we found that although LMSE tracked the measured data marginally better than EM, EM was far more accurate in unmasking the time courses and properties of the hidden states of learning. In a power analysis designed to measure the effect of an intervention on sensorimotor learning, EM significantly reduced the number of subjects that were required for effective hypothesis testing. In summary, we developed a new approach for analysis of data in sensorimotor experiments. The new algorithm improved the ability to uncover the multiple processes that contribute to learning from error. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor learning is supported by multiple adaptive processes, each with distinct error sensitivity and forgetting rates. We developed a generalized expectation maximization algorithm that uncovers these hidden processes in the context of modern sensorimotor learning experiments that include error-clamp trials and set breaks. The resulting toolbox may improve the ability to identify the properties of these hidden processes and reduce the number of subjects needed to test the effectiveness of interventions on sensorimotor learning. © 2018 the American Physiological Society.

We explored possible association with early child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional neurodevelopmental assessment of 12–48 month-old children using the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) and the Gensini Gavito Scale (GGS). We used the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-10 (HSCL-10) and Goldberg Depression Anxiety Scale (GDAS) to screen for symptoms of maternal depression-anxiety. We used the cyanogen content in household cassava flour and urinary thiocyanate (SCN) as biomarkers of dietary cyanogen exposure. We employed multivariable generalized linear models (GLM) with Gamma link function to determine predictors of early child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Results The mean (SD) and median (IQR) of cyanogen content of cassava household flour were above the WHO cut-off points of 10 ppm (52.18 [3279]) and 50 (30–50) ppm, respectively. Mean (SD) urinary levels of thiocyanate and median (IQR) were respectively 81781 (47459) and 688 (344–1032) μmole/l in mothers, and 61749 (44948) and 688 (344–688) μmole/l in children reflecting individual high levels as well as a community-wide cyanogenic exposure. The concentration of cyanide in cassava flour was significantly associated with early child neurodevelopment, motor development and cognitive ability as indicated by univariable linear regression (p < 0.05). After adjusting for biological and socioeconomic predictors at multivariable analyses, fine motor proficiency and child neurodevelopment remained the main predictors associated with the concentration of cyanide in cassava flour: coefficients of -008 to -.15 (p < 001). We also found a significant association between child linear growth, early child neurodevelopment, cognitive ability and motor development at both univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses coefficients of 1.44 to 7.31 (p < 001). Conclusion Dietary cyanogen exposure is associated with early child neurodevelopment, cognitive abilities and motor development, even in the absence of clinically evident paralysis.

The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST-PC © ) is a virtual simulator that was developed as a computerized version of the pattern cutting (PC) task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system. To establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PC © , we assessed trainees’ learning curves using the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method and compared them with those on the FLS. Methods: Twenty-four medical students were randomly assigned to an FLS training group, a VBLaST training group, or a control group. Fifteen training sessions, 30 min in duration per session per day, were conducted over 3 weeks. All subjects completed pretest, posttest, and retention test (2 weeks after posttest) on both the FLS and VBLaST © simulators. Performance data, including time, error, FLS score, learning rate, learning plateau, and CUSUM score, were analyzed. Results: The learning curve for all trained subjects demonstrated increasing performance and a performance plateau. CUSUM analyses showed that five of the seven subjects reached the intermediate proficiency level but none reached the expert proficiency level after 150 practice trials. Performance was significantly improved after simulation training, but only in the assigned simulator. No significant decay of skills after 2 weeks of disuse was observed. Control subjects did not show any learning on the FLS simulator, but improved continually in the VBLaST simulator. Conclusions: Although VBLaST © - and FLS-trained subjects demonstrated similar learning rates and plateaus, the majority of subjects required more than 150 trials to achieve proficiency. Trained subjects demonstrated improved performance in only the assigned simulator, indicating specificity of training. The virtual simulator may provide better opportunities for learning, especially with limited training exposure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Convergent validity; Cumulative summation (CUSUM); Learning curve; Surgical training; Virtual reality","analytical error; Article; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; human; laparoscopic surgery; learning curve; medical student; outcome assessment; pretest posttest design; priority journal; simulation training; skill; surgical training; transfer of learning; validation process; virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer; virtual reality; clinical competence; education; laparoscopy; medical education; procedures; randomized controlled trial; simulation training; United States; validation study; virtual reality; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Laparoscopy; Learning Curve; Simulation Training; Students, Medical; United States; Virtual Reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031775886

While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure. © 2018 Lieder et al.",,"article; associative learning; behavior; executive function; human; human experiment; nerve tract; plasticity; reinforcement; self control; stimulus; transfer of learning; visual attention; adaptation; attention; biological model; biology; brain; cognition; computer simulation; coping behavior; decision making; learning; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; psychological model; reward; Adaptation, Physiological; Adaptation, Psychological; Association Learning; Attention; Brain; Cognition; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Decision Making; Humans; Learning; Models, Neurological; Models, Psychological; Neural Pathways; Neuronal Plasticity; Reward",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046358518

The continuous high-frequency (200-600Hz) electric organ discharge (EOD) of Eigenmannia, a weakly electric fish, underlies its electrosensing and communication. EODs reflect APs fired by the muscle-derived electrocytes of the electric organ (EO). Cholinergic synapses at the excitable posterior membranes of the elongated electrocytes control AP frequency. Based on whole-fish O2 consumption, ATP demand per EOD-linked AP increases exponentially with AP frequency. Continual EOD-AP generation implies first, that ion homeostatic processes reliably counteract any dissipation of posterior membrane ENa and EK and second that high frequency synaptic activation is reliably supported. Both of these processes require energy. To facilitate an exploration of the expected energy demands of each, we modify a previous excitability model and include synaptic currents able to drive APs at frequencies as high as 600 Hz. Synaptic stimuli are modeled as pulsatile cation conductance changes, with or without a small (sustained) background conductance. Over the full species range of EOD frequencies (200–600 Hz) we calculate frequency-dependent “Na+-entry budgets” for an electrocyte AP as a surrogate for required 3Na+/2K+-ATPase activity. We find that the cost per AP of maintaining constant-amplitude APs increases nonlinearly with frequency, whereas the cost per AP for synaptic input current is essentially constant. This predicts that Na+ channel density should correlate positively with EOD frequency, whereas AChR density should be the same across fish. Importantly, calculated costs (inferred from Na+-entry through Nav and ACh channels) for electrocyte APs as frequencies rise are much less than expected from published whole-fish EOD-linked O2 consumption. For APs at increasingly high frequencies, we suggest that EOD-related costs external to electrocytes (including packaging of synaptic transmitter) substantially exceed the direct cost of electrocyte ion homeostasis. © 2018 Joos et al.

Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff. © 2018 Franklin, Frank.",,"article; human; learning; reward; statistics; stochastic model; theoretical study; Bayes theorem; biology; cluster analysis; computer simulation; information science; Markov chain; nonparametric test; psychological model; task performance; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Humans; Information Theory; Learning; Models, Psychological; Reward; Statistics, Nonparametric; Stochastic Processes; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046365643

Methods This is a prospective validation study with a fully crossed (person × scenario × rater) study design. The Concise Assessment of Leader Management (CALM) instrument was designed by pediatric emergency medicine and graduate medical education experts to be used off the shelf to evaluate and provide formative feedback to resuscitation leaders. Four experts reviewed 16 videos of in situ simulated pediatric resuscitations and scored resuscitation leader performance using the CALM instrument. The videos consisted of 4 pediatric emergency department resuscitation teams each performing in 4 pediatric resuscitation scenarios (cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, seizure, and sepsis). We report on content and internal structure (reliability) validity of the CALM instrument. Results Content validity was supported by the instrument development process that involved professional experience, expert consensus, focused literature review, and pilot testing. Internal structure validity (reliability) was supported by the generalizability analysis. The main component that contributed to score variability was the person (33%), meaning that individual leaders performed differently. The rater component had almost zero (0%) contribution to variance, which implies that raters were in agreement and argues for high interrater reliability. Conclusions These results provide initial evidence to support the validity of the CALM instrument as a reliable assessment instrument that can facilitate formative feedback to leaders of pediatric simulated resuscitations. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Resuscitation; Simulation; Team leader","checklist; constructive feedback; education; emergency health service; leadership; pediatrics; prospective study; resuscitation; simulation training; standards; validation study; Checklist; Emergency Medical Services; Formative Feedback; Leadership; Pediatrics; Prospective Studies; Resuscitation; Simulation Training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045441297

Our streamlined method uses standard bioinformatic file formats, allowing users to seamlessly integrate new and existing utilities into the pipeline as desired, and introduces a method for evaluating the specificity of each probe molecule that connects simulated hybridization energetics to rapidly generated sequence alignments using supervised machine learning. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing genome-scale probe discovery in numerous model organism genomes and showcase the performance of the resulting probes with diffraction-limited and single-molecule superresolution imaging of chromosomal and RNA targets.

We have developed the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) that simulates tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) curriculum. This study aims to show convergent validity of the VBLaST pattern cutting module via the CUSUM method to quantify learning curves along with motor skill transfer from simulation environments to ex vivo tissue samples. Methods: 18 medical students at the University at Buffalo, with no prior laparoscopic surgical skills, were placed into the control, FLS training, or VBLaST training groups. Each training group performed pattern cutting trials for 12 consecutive days on their respective simulation trainers. Following a 2-week break period, the trained students performed three pattern cutting trials on each simulation platform to measure skill retention. All subjects then performed one pattern cutting task on ex vivo cadaveric peritoneal tissue. FLS and VBLaST pattern cutting scores, CUSUM scores, and transfer task completion times were reported. Results: Results indicate that the FLS and VBLaST trained groups have significantly higher task performance scores than the control group in both the VBLaST and FLS environments (p < 0.05). Learning curve results indicate that three out of seven FLS training subjects and four out of six VBLaST training subjects achieved the “senior” performance level. Furthermore, both the FLS and VBLaST trained groups had significantly lower transfer task completion times on ex vivo peritoneal tissue models (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We characterized task performance scores for trained VBLaST and FLS subjects via CUSUM analysis of the learning curves and showed evidence that both groups have significant improvements in surgical motor skill.

Their rapid development, ability to model human diseases, utility for testing genetic variants identified from next-generation sequencing, amenity to CRISPR mutagenesis, and potential for therapeutic compound screening, has led to their wide-spread adoption in diverse fields of study. However, their power for large-scale screens is limited by the absence of automated genotyping tools for live animals. This constrains potential drug screen options, limits analysis of embryonic and larval phenotypes, and requires raising additional animals to adulthood to ensure obtaining an animal of the desired genotype. Our objective was to develop an automated system that would rapidly obtain cells and DNA from zebrafish embryos and larvae for genotyping, and that would keep the animals alive. We describe the development, testing, and validation of a zebrafish embryonic genotyping device, termed ""ZEG"" (Zebrafish Embryo Genotyper). Using microfluidic harmonic oscillation of the animal on a roughened glass surface, the ZEG is able to obtain genetic material (cells and DNA) for use in genotyping, from 24 embryos or larvae simultaneously in less than 10 minutes. Loading and unloading of the ZEG is performed manually with a standard pipette tip or transfer pipette. The obtained genetic material is amplified by PCR and can be used for subsequent analysis including sequencing, gel electrophoresis, or high-resolution melt-analysis. Sensitivity of genotyping and survival of animals are both greater than 90%. There are no apparent effects on body morphology, development, or motor behavior tests. In summary, the ZEG device enables rapid genotyping of live zebrafish embryos and larvae, and animals are available for downstream applications, testing, or raising. © 2018 Lambert et al.

To mitigate ROS damage, organisms have evolved a variety of antioxidant systems to counteract these harmful molecules, however in certain pathological conditions these protective mechanisms can be overwhelmed. We have recently demonstrated that Peptide Inhibitor of Complement C1 (PIC1) mitigates peroxidase activity of the heme bearing proteins myeloperoxidase, hemoglobin, and myoglobin through a reversible process. To determine if this property of PIC1 was antioxidant in nature, we tested PIC1 in a number of well-established antioxidant assays. PIC1 showed dose-dependent antioxidant activity in a total antioxidant (TAC) assay, hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay, oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assay as well as the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to screen for PIC1 antioxidant activity in human plasma. The antioxidant activity of PIC1 in the TAC assay, as well as the HORAC/ORAC assay demonstrated that this peptide acts via the single electron transport (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms, respectively. Consistent with this mechanism of action, PIC1 did not show activity in a metal chelating activity (MCA) assay. PIC1 contains two vicinal cysteine residues and displayed similar antioxidant activity to the well characterized cysteine-containing tripeptide antioxidant molecule glutathione (GSH). Consistent with the role of the cysteine residues in the antioxidant activity of PIC1, oxidation of these residues significantly abrogated antioxidant activity. These results demonstrate that in addition to its described complement inhibiting activity, PIC1 displays in vitro antioxidant activity. © 2018 Gregory Rivera et al.

The ability to conduct accurate, patient specific computer simulations would provide surgeons with valuable insight into the physical processes occurring within the tissue as it is heated or cooled. Several studies have modeled tissue as porous media, yet fully coupled thermoporomechanics (TPM) models are limited. Therefore, this study introduces a small deformation theory of modeling the TPM occurring within biological tissue. Next, the model is used to simulate the mass, momentum, and energy balance occurring within an artery wall when heated by a tissue fusion device and compared to experimental values. Though limited by its small strain assumption, the model predicted final tissue temperature and water content within one standard deviation of experimental data for seven of seven simulations. Additionally, the model showed the ability to predict the final displacement of the tissue to within 15% of experimental results. These results promote potential design of novel medical devices and more accurate simulations allowing for scientists and surgeons to quickly, yet accurately, assess the effects of surgical procedures as well as provide a first step toward a fully coupled large deformation TPM finite element (FE) model. © 2018 by ASME.","bioheat transfer; biomechanics; Finite element modeling; poromechanics; thermoporomechanics; tissue fusion","Biomechanics; Biomedical equipment; Deformation; Medical computing; Porous materials; Tissue; Bio-heat transfer; Biological tissues; Experimental values; Poro-mechanics; Surgical procedures; thermoporomechanics; Tissue fusions; Tissue temperatures; Finite element method; arterial tissue; artery wall; Article; biomechanics; computer simulation; deformation; energy balance; entropy; experimental study; finite element analysis; kinematics; measurement accuracy; mechanics; physical phenomena; porosity; standard; stress strain relationship; temperature; thermal conductivity; thermoporomechanics; tissue temperature; water content; artery; cytology; temperature; Arteries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Finite Element Analysis; Mechanical Phenomena; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041171857

To render spatialized sounds within a virtual reality (VR) headset, either individualized or generic Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are usually employed. The former require arduous calibrations, but enable accurate auditory source localization, which may lead to a heightened sense of presence within VR. The latter obviate the need for individualized calibrations, but result in less accurate auditory source localization. Previous research on auditory source localization in the real world suggests that our representation of acoustic space is highly plastic. In light of these findings, we investigated whether auditory source localization could be improved for users of generic HRTFs via cross-modal learning. The results show that pairing a dynamic auditory stimulus, with a spatio-temporally aligned visual counterpart, enabled users of generic HRTFs to improve subsequent auditory source localization. Exposure to the auditory stimulus alone or to asynchronous audiovisual stimuli did not improve auditory source localization. These findings have important implications for human perception as well as the development of VR systems as they indicate that generic HRTFs may be enough to enable good auditory source localization in VR. © 2018 Berger, Gonzalez-Franco, Tajadura-Jiménez, Florencio and Zhang.","Auditory perception; Auditory training; Cross-modal perception; Cross-modal plasticity; HRTF (head related transfer function); Spatial audio; Virtual reality","article; auditory stimulation; calibration; head; hearing; human; learning; plasticity; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041845498

We hypothesized that a comprehensive mental skills curriculum (MSC) would minimize resident performance deterioration under stress. Methods: Twenty-four residents were stratified then randomized to receive mental skills and FLS training (MSC group), or only FLS training (control group). Laparoscopic suturing skill was assessed on a live porcine model with and without external stressors. Outcomes were compared with t-tests. Results: Twenty-three residents completed the study. The groups were similar at baseline. There were no differences in suturing at posttest or transfer test under normal conditions. Both groups experienced significantly decreased performance when stress was applied, but the MSC group significantly outperformed controls under stress. Conclusions: This MSC enabled residents to perform significantly better than controls in the simulated OR under unexpected stressful conditions.

We numerically identify which of the experimentally measured initial conditions are vulnerable to CD colonization, then formalize the notion of CD susceptibility analytically. We simulate fecal transplantation, a clinically successful treatment for CDI, and discover that both the transplant timing and transplant donor are relevant to the the efficacy of the treatment, a result which has clinical implications. We incorporate two nongeneric yet dangerous attributes of CD into the gLV model, sporulation and antibiotic-resistant mutation, and for each identify relevant SIR techniques that describe the desired attribute.

Lapses in sustained attention are frequent and often problematic, with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Recent work has had some success in finding signatures of sustained attention in whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) measures during basic tasks, but since FC can be dynamic and task-dependent, it remains unclear how fully these signatures would generalize to a more complex and naturalistic scenario. To this end, we used a previously defined whole-brain FC network – a marker of attention that was derived from a sustained attention task – to predict the ability of participants to recall material during a free-viewing reading task. Though the predictive network was trained on a different task and set of participants, the strength of FC in the sustained attention network predicted reading recall significantly better than permutation tests where behavior was scrambled to simulate chance performance. To test the generalization of the method used to derive the sustained attention network, we applied the same method to our reading task data to find a new FC network whose strength specifically predicts reading recall. Even though the sustained attention network provided significant prediction of recall, the reading network was more predictive of recall accuracy. The new reading network's spatial distribution indicates that reading recall is highest when temporal pole regions have higher FC with left occipital regions and lower FC with bilateral supramarginal gyrus. Right cerebellar to right frontal connectivity is also indicative of poor reading recall. We examine these and other differences between the two predictive FC networks, providing new insight into the task-dependent nature of FC-based performance metrics. © 2017","fMRI; Functional connectivity; Reading; Sustained attention","accuracy; adult; Article; attention; auditory stimulation; correlational study; female; functional connectivity; human; male; mental performance; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; reading; recall; speech test; steady state; supramarginal gyrus; sustained attention; task performance; visual stimulation; attention; brain; comprehension; connectome; diagnostic imaging; nerve cell network; oculography; physiology; procedures; recall; young adult; biological marker; Adult; Attention; Biomarkers; Brain; Comprehension; Connectome; Eye Movement Measurements; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Recall; Nerve Net; Reading; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032791586

Each subject completed a 5-week training using four simulation tasks. Pre- and post-training data were collected using both a simulator and robot. Peri-training data were collected after each session. Skill learning, time spent on PM (TPM), and cognitive workloads were compared between groups. Results: After the simulation training, CG showed substantially lower simulation task scores (82.9 ± 6.0) compared with EG (93.2 ± 4.8). Both groups demonstrated improved physical model tasks performance with the actual robot, but the EG had a greater improvement in two tasks. The EG exhibited lower global mental workload/distress, higher engagement, and a better understanding regarding using PM to improve performance. The EG’s TPM was initially long but substantially shortened as the group became familiar with PM. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the current VR simulator offered limited self-skill learning and additional mentoring still played an important role in improving the robotic surgery simulation training. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Mentoring; Performance metrics; Robotic surgery; Simulation; Training; Virtual reality","adult; Article; cognition; controlled study; human; learning; physical model; priority journal; resident; robot assisted surgery; simulation training; surgical training; task performance; virtual reality; workload; clinical competence; cognition; education; medical education; mentor; mentoring; procedures; questionnaire; robotic surgical procedure; simulation training; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Clinical Competence; Cognition; Humans; Internship and Residency; Mentoring; Mentors; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality; Workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021127892

A cylindrical phantom containing 24 anthropomorphic liver lesions (modeled from patient lesions) was designed using computer-aided design software (Rhinoceros 3D). Lesions had irregular shapes, 2 sizes (523, 2145 mm3), and 2 contrast levels (80, 100 HU). The phantom was printed with a state-of-the-art multimaterial 3D printer (Stratasys J750). CT images were acquired on a clinical CT scanner (Siemens Flash) at 4 dose levels (CTDIVol, 32 cm phantom: 1.5, 3, 6, 22 mGy) and reconstructed using 2 FBP kernels (B31f, B45f) and 2 iterative kernels (SAFIRE, strength-2: I31f, and I44f). 3D-TTFs were estimated by combining TTFs measured using low-contrast rod inserts (in-plane) and a slanted edge (z-direction) printed in-phantom. CAD versions of lesions were blurred by 3D-TTFs and virtually superimposed into corresponding phantom images using a previously validated technique. We compared lesion morphometry (i.e., size and shape) measurements between 3D printed ""physical"" and TTF-blurred ""simulated"" lesions across multiple acquisitions. Lesion size was quantified using a commercial segmentation software (Syngo.via). Lesion shape was quantified by measuring the Jaccard index between the segmented masks of paired physical and simulated lesions. The relative volume difference D between physical and simulated lesions was mostly less than the natural variability COV of the physical lesions. For large and small lesions, the COV1,o was greater or similar to Do in 12 and 13 out of 16 imaging scenarios, respectively. Simulated and physical lesion shapes were similar, with an average simulated-physical Jaccard index of 0.70 (out of max value of unity).

For algorithm performance evaluation that generalizes to a targeted population of cases, ideally, test datasets randomly drawn from the targeted population are used. To ensure that test results generalize to new data, the algorithm needs to be evaluated on new and independent test data each time a new performance evaluation is required. However, medical test datasets of sufficient quality are often hard to acquire, and it is tempting to utilize a previously-used test dataset for a new performance evaluation. With extensive simulation studies, we illustrate how such a «naive» approach to test data reuse can inadvertently result in overfitting the algorithm to the test data, even when only a global performance metric is reported back from the test dataset. The overfitting behavior leads to a loss in generalization and overly optimistic conclusions about the algorithm performance. We investigate the use of the Thresholdout method of Dwork et. al. (Ref. 1) to tackle this problem. Thresholdout allows repeated reuse of the same test dataset. It essentially reports a noisy version of the performance metric on the test data, and provides theoretical guarantees on how many times the test dataset can be accessed to ensure generalization of the reported answers to the underlying distribution. With extensive simulation studies, we show that Thresholdout indeed substantially reduces the problem of overfitting to the test data under the simulation conditions, at the cost of a mild additional uncertainty on the reported test performance. We also extend some of the theoretical guarantees to the area under the ROC curve as the reported performance metric. © 2018 SPIE.","Adaptive data analysis; area under the ROC curve (AUC); classification performance; continuous machine learning; data reuse; receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC); reusable holdout; Thresholdout","Artificial intelligence; Curve fitting; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Quality control; Statistical tests; Area under the ROC curve; Classification performance; Data reuse; Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves; reusable holdout; Thresholdout; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047843672

The first approach requires explicit models for both the target and the background, and employs a generalized likelihood ratio in order to obtain a detector that is optimized to those specific models. When this approach is most successful, a closed-form solution is obtained that permits the detector to be efficiently applied. A specific example of this approach is outlined in some detail, leading to the elliptically-contoured finite-Target matched filter (EC-FTMF), a variant of the classical FTMF algorithm that uses a multivariate t-distribution instead of a Gaussian as the model for the background. The second approach also requires an explicit model of the target, but does not need a model for the background. In this second approach, matched pairs of data samples are created: for each pixel in the original hyperspectral image, a corresponding pixel is generated by implanting the target into the original pixel. These matched pairs are used as training data for a machine learning algorithm to classify pixels as either non-Target or target. Here we use a support vector machine, but the matched pair machine learning (MPML) framework does not restrict the choice of classifier type. Detectors using both approaches are applied both to simulated data (with Gaussian and with multivariate fit distributed backgrounds) and to real hyperspectral data with known, referenced targets. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This paper describes a novel approach to spectrally resolved fluorescence microscopy, termed sensorFRET, that enables quantitative measurement of FRET efficiency. This approach is an improvement on existing methods (FLIM, sRET, luxFRET, pFRET), as it does not require single fluorophore standards to be measured with every experiment and the acquisition is intensity independent, allowing the laser power to be optimized for varying levels of fluorophore expression. Additionally, it was found that all spectral based methods, including sensorFRET, fail at specific fluorophore-excitation wavelength combinations. These combinations can be determined a priori using sensorFRET, whereas other methods would give no indication of inaccuracies. This method was thoroughly validated and compared to existing methods using simulated spectra, Fluorescein and TAMRA dye mixtures as a zero FRET control, and Cerulean-Venus FRET standards as positive FRET controls. Simulations also provided a means of quantifying the uncertainty in each measurement by relating the fit residual of noisy spectra to the standard deviation of the measured FRET efficiency. As an example application, Teal-Venus force sensitive biosensors integrated into E-cadherin were used to resolve piconewton scale forces along different parts of an individual cell junction. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester; cadherin; fluorescein; rhodamine; cell junction; chemistry; fluorescence microscopy; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; genetic procedures; human; procedures; Biosensing Techniques; Cadherins; Fluorescein; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Humans; Intercellular Junctions; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Rhodamines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034435436

A 31P MRF sequence (CK-MRF) was developed to quantify the forward rate constant of ATP synthesis via CK ((Formula presented.)), the T1 relaxation time of PCr ((Formula presented.)), and the PCr-to-ATP concentration ratio ((Formula presented.). The CK-MRF sequence used a balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP)-type excitation with ramped flip angles and a unique saturation scheme sensitive to the exchange between PCr and γATP. Parameter estimation was accomplished by matching the acquired signals to a dictionary generated using the Bloch-McConnell equation. Simulation studies were performed to examine the susceptibility of the CK-MRF method to several potential error sources. The accuracy of nonlocalized CK-MRF measurements before and after an ischemia–reperfusion (IR) protocol was compared with the magnetization transfer (MT-MRS) method in rat hindlimb at 9.4 T (n = 14). The reproducibility of CK-MRF was also assessed by comparing CK-MRF measurements with both MT-MRS (n = 17) and four angle saturation transfer (FAST) (n = 7). Simulation results showed that CK-MRF quantification of (Formula presented.) was robust, with less than 5% error in the presence of model inaccuracies including dictionary resolution, metabolite T2 values, inorganic phosphate metabolism, and B1 miscalibration. Estimation of (Formula presented.) by CK-MRF (0.38 ± 0.02 s−1 at baseline and 0.42 ± 0.03 s−1 post-IR) showed strong agreement with MT-MRS (0.39 ± 0.03 s−1 at baseline and 0.44 ± 0.04 s−1 post-IR). (Formula presented.) estimation was also similar between CK-MRF and FAST (0.38 ± 0.02 s−1 for CK-MRF and 0.38 ± 0.11 s−1 for FAST). The coefficient of variation from 20 s CK-MRF quantification of (Formula presented.) was 42% of that by 150 s MT-MRS acquisition and was 12% of that by 20 s FAST acquisition. This study demonstrates the potential of a 31P spectroscopic MRF framework for rapid, accurate and reproducible quantification of chemical exchange rate of CK in vivo.

The objective of this study was to estimate the range of injury risks to humans due to UAS impact. Three commercially-available UAS models that varied in mass (1.2–11 kg) were evaluated to estimate the range of risk associated with UAS-human interaction. Live flight and falling impact tests were conducted using an instrumented Hybrid III test dummy. On average, live flight tests were observed to be less severe than falling impact tests. The maximum risk of AIS 3+ injury associated with live flight tests was 11.6%, while several falling impact tests estimated risks exceeding 50%. Risk of injury was observed to increase with increasing UAS mass, and the larger models tested are not safe for operations over people in their current form. However, there is likely a subset of smaller UAS models that are safe to operate over people. Further, designs which redirect the UAS away from the head or deform upon impact transfer less energy and generate lower risk. These data represent a necessary impact testing foundation for future UAS regulations on operations over people. © 2017, The Author(s).","Brain; Cervical spine; Concussion; Drone; Neck; Skull","Bone; Brain; Drones; Impact testing; Risk perception; Cervical spine; Concussion; Flight test; Human interactions; Hybrid III test dummies; Neck; Skull; Unmanned aircraft system; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); aircraft accident; Article; association; falling; falling impact test; flight; head and neck injury; high risk behavior; human; human relation; life threat; live flight test; medical parameters; model; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; safety; acceleration; adult; aircraft; biological model; cervical vertebra; computer simulation; head injury; injuries; male; neck injury; pathophysiology; procedures; risk assessment; traffic accident; Acceleration; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aircraft; Cervical Vertebrae; Computer Simulation; Head Injuries, Closed; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Neck Injuries; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029528938

Here we study the performance of such task allocation mechanisms measured in terms of the time for individuals to allocate to tasks. We ask: (1) Is task allocation fundamentally difficult, and thus costly? (2) Does the performance of task allocation mechanisms depend on the number of individuals? And (3) what other parameters may affect their efficiency? We use techniques from distributed computing theory to develop a model of a social insect colony, where workers have to be allocated to a set of tasks; however, our model is generalizable to other systems. We show, first, that the ability of workers to quickly assess demand for work in tasks they are not currently engaged in crucially affects whether task allocation is quickly achieved or not. This indicates that in social insect tasks such as thermoregulation, where temperature may provide a global and near instantaneous stimulus to measure the need for cooling, for example, it should be easy to match the number of workers to the need for work. In other tasks, such as nest repair, it may be impossible for workers not directly at the work site to know that this task needs more workers. We argue that this affects whether task allocation mechanisms are under strong selection. Second, we show that colony size does not affect task allocation performance under our assumptions. This implies that when effects of colony size are found, they are not inherent in the process of task allocation itself, but due to processes not modeled here, such as higher variation in task demand for smaller colonies, benefits of specialized workers, or constant overhead costs. Third, we show that the ratio of the number of available workers to the workload crucially affects performance. Thus, workers in excess of those needed to complete all tasks improve task allocation performance. This provides a potential explanation for the phenomenon that social insect colonies commonly contain inactive workers: these may be a ‘surplus’ set of workers that improves colony function by speeding up optimal allocation of workers to tasks. Overall our study shows how limitations at the individual level can affect group level outcomes, and suggests new hypotheses that can be explored empirically. © 2017 Radeva et al.",,"adult; cooling; female; human; human experiment; insect society; male; nonhuman; stimulus; theoretical study; thermoregulation; worker; workload; algorithm; animal; animal behavior; biological model; biology; computer simulation; insect; physiological feedback; physiology; social behavior; systems biology; task performance; Algorithms; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Temperature Regulation; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Feedback, Physiological; Insecta; Models, Biological; Social Behavior; Systems Biology; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039906071

Diseases such as macular degeneration can change visual sensory processing, introducing central vision loss (a scotoma). However, humans can learn to direct a new preferred retinal location to regions of interest for simple visual tasks. Whether such learned compensatory saccades are optimal and generalize to more complex tasks, which require integrating information across a large area of the visual field, is not well understood. Here, we explore the possible effects of central vision loss on the optimal saccades during a face identification task, using a gaze-contingent simulated scotoma. We show that a new foveated ideal observer with a central scotoma correctly predicts that the human optimal point of fixation to identify faces shifts from just below the eyes to one that is at the tip of the nose and another at the top of the forehead. However, even after 5000 trials, humans of both sexes surprisingly do not change their initial fixations to adapt to the new optimal fixation points to faces. In contrast, saccades do change for tasks such as object following and to a lesser extent during search. Our findings argue against a central brain motor-compensatory mechanism that generalizes across tasks. They instead suggest task specificity in the learning of oculomotor plans in response to changes in front-end sensory processing and the possibility of separate domain-specific representations of learned oculomotor plans in the brain. © 2017 the authors.","Foveation; Optimality; Saccades; Scotoma","Article; cell specificity; central scotoma; controlled study; crowding (vision); eye movement; eye tracking; facial recognition; human; macular degeneration; oculomotor nerve; priority journal; psychophysics; sensory nerve cell; stimulus response; task performance; visual impairment; visual stimulation; adaptation; extraocular muscle; female; innervation; learning; male; pathophysiology; psychomotor performance; saccadic eye movement; scotoma; vision; young adult; Adaptation, Physiological; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Oculomotor Muscles; Psychomotor Performance; Saccades; Scotoma; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035112968

Here we present Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis (MCPA), which works by learning mappings between the activity patterns of the populations as a factor of the information being processed. These maps are used to predict the activity from one neural population based on the activity from the other population. Successful MCPA-based decoding indicates the involvement of distributed computational processing and provides a framework for probing the representational structure of the interaction. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of MCPA in realistic circumstances. In addition, we demonstrate that MCPA can be applied to different signal modalities to evaluate a variety of hypothesis associated with information coding in neural communications. We apply MCPA to fMRI and human intracranial electrophysiological data to provide a proof-of-concept of the utility of this method for decoding individual natural images and faces in functional connectivity data. We further use a MCPA-based representational similarity analysis to illustrate how MCPA may be used to test computational models of information transfer among regions of the visual processing stream. Thus, MCPA can be used to assess the information represented in the coupled activity of interacting neural circuits and probe the underlying principles of information transformation between regions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Decoding; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG); Multivariate statistical analysis; Representation similarity analysis","adult; Article; brain electrophysiology; classification; connectome; controlled study; electroencephalogram; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; image analysis; information processing; male; middle aged; multi connection pattern analysis; normal human; priority journal; psychophysiology; simulation; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; biological model; brain; brain mapping; computer simulation; machine learning; nerve cell network; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Humans; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Pattern Recognition, Automated",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028556690

The system consists of geared knee and ankle motors, parallel springs for each motor, an ultracapacitor, and controllable four-quadrant power converters. The goal is to maximize the performance of the system by finding optimal controls and design parameters. A model of the system dynamics was developed, and used to solve a combined trajectory and design optimization problem. The objectives of the optimization were to minimize tracking error relative to human joint motions, as well as energy use. The optimization problem was solved by the method of direct collocation, based on joint torque and joint angle data from ten subjects walking at three speeds. After optimization of controls and design parameters, the simulated system could operate at zero energy cost while still closely emulating able-bodied gait. This was achieved by controlled energy transfer between knee and ankle, and by controlled storage and release of energy throughout the gait cycle. Optimal gear ratios and spring parameters were similar across subjects and walking speeds. © 2017 Rohani et al.

These characteristics are typically studied in isolation, leaving the interaction largely unknown. Here we examined how the temporal decay of visuomotor adaptation influences the spatial generalization of the motor recalibration. First, we quantified the extent to which adaptation decayed over time. Subjects reached to a peripheral target, and a rotation was applied to the visual feedback of the unseen motion. The retention of this adaptation over different delays (0-120 s) 1) decreased by 29.0 ± 6.8% at the longest delay and 2) was represented by a simple exponential, with a time constant of 22.5 ± 5.6 s. On the basis of this relationship we simulated how the spatial generalization of adaptation would change with delay. To test this directly, we trained additional subjects with the same perturbation and assessed transfer to 19 different locations (spaced 15° apart, symmetric around the trained location) and examined three delays (~4, 12, and 25 s). Consistent with the simulation, we found that generalization around the trained direction (±15°) significantly decreased with delay and distance, while locations >60° displayed near-constant spatiotemporal transfer. Intermediate distances (30° and 45°) showed a difference in transfer across space, but this amount was approximately constant across time. Interestingly, the decay at the trained direction was faster than that based purely on time, suggesting that the spatial transfer of adaptation is modified by concurrent passive (time dependent) and active (movement dependent) processes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Short-term motor adaptation exhibits distinct spatial and temporal characteristics. Here we investigated the interaction of these features, utilizing a simple motor adaptation paradigm (recalibration of reaching arm movements in response to rotated visual feedback). We examined the changes in the spatial generalization of motor adaptation for different temporal manipulations and report that the spatiotemporal generalization of motor adaptation is generally local and is influenced by both passive (time dependent) and active (movement dependent) learning processes. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Decay; Generalization; Motor adaptation; Spatiotemporal generalization; Stability","Article; female; hand movement; human; human experiment; male; memory; motion; motor control; movement (physiology); normal human; priority journal; sensorimotor function; simulation; task performance; visual adaptation; visual feedback; visuomotor adaptation; adult; arm; brain; innervation; learning; movement (physiology); physiological feedback; physiology; time; vision; Adult; Arm; Brain; Feedback, Physiological; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Male; Movement; Time; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032025865

Identifying the appropriate stimulation parameters (intensity, frequency and anode/cathode assignment) is an arduous task and requires extensive mapping of the spinal cord using evoked potentials. Effective visualization and detection of muscle evoked potentials induced by scES from the recorded electromyography (EMG) signals is critical to identify the optimal configurations and the effects of specific scES parameters on muscle activation. The purpose of this work was to develop a novel approach to automatically detect the occurrence of evoked potentials, quantify the attributes of the signal and visualize the effects across a high number of scES parameters. This new method is designed to automate the current process for performing this task, which has been accomplished manually by data analysts through observation of raw EMG signals, a process that is laborious and time-consuming as well as prone to human errors. The proposed method provides a fast and accurate five-step algorithms framework for activation detection and visualization of the results including: conversion of the EMG signal into its 2-D representation by overlaying the located signal building blocks; de-noising the 2-D image by applying the Generalized Gaussian Markov Random Field technique; detection of the occurrence of evoked potentials using a statistically optimal decision method through the comparison of the probability density functions of each segment to the background noise utilizing log-likelihood ratio; feature extraction of detected motor units such as peak-to-peak amplitude, latency, integrated EMG and Min-max time intervals; and finally visualization of the outputs as Colormap images. In comparing the automatic method vs. manual detection on 700 EMG signals from five individuals, the new approach decreased the processing time from several hours to less than 15 seconds for each set of data, and demonstrated an average accuracy of 98.28% based on the combined false positive and false negative error rates. The sensitivity of this method to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was tested using simulated EMG signals and compared to two existing methods, where the novel technique showed much lower sensitivity to the SNR. © 2017 Mesbah et al.

Design Observational prospective cohort study. Design Classification Prospective cohort. Setting Urban teaching university hospital. Participants (Patients) Thirty-one obstetrics and gynecology residents, postgraduate years 1 to 4. Intervention We assessed 4 basic laparoscopic skills at 2 sessions. The first session was the baseline; 6 months later the same skills were assessed under audiovisual stressors. We compared the effect of stress on accuracy and efficiency between the 2 sessions. Measurements and Main Results A linear model was used to analyze time. Under stress, residents were more efficient in 3 of the 4 modules. Ring transfer (hand-eye coordination and bimanual dexterity), p = 0.0304. Ring of fire (bimanual dexterity and measure of depth perception), p = 0.0024 and dissection glove (respect of delicate tissue planes), p = 0.0002. Poisson regression was used to analyze the total number of penalties. Residents were more likely to acquire penalties under stress. Ring transfer, p = 0.0184 and cobra (hand-to-hand coordination), p = 0.0487 yielded a statistically significant increase in penalties in the presence of stressors. Dissection glove p = 0.0605 yielded a nonsignificant increase in penalties.

STP is traditionally studied using intracellular recordings of postsynaptic potentials or currents evoked by presynaptic spikes. However, STP also affects the statistics of postsynaptic spikes. Here we present two model-based approaches for estimating synaptic weights and short-term plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spike observations alone. We extend a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicts postsynaptic spiking as a function of the observed pre- and postsynaptic spikes and allow the connection strength (coupling term in the GLM) to vary as a function of time based on the history of presynaptic spikes. Our first model assumes that STP follows a Tsodyks-Markram description of vesicle depletion and recovery. In a second model, we introduce a functional description of STP where we estimate the coupling term as a biophysically unrestrained function of the presynaptic inter-spike intervals. To validate the models, we test the accuracy of STP estimation using the spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons with known synaptic dynamics. We first test our models using the responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to simulated presynaptic input with different types of STP, and then use simulated spike trains to examine the effects of spike-frequency adaptation, stochastic vesicle release, spike sorting errors, and common input. We find that, using only spike observations, both model-based methods can accurately reconstruct the time-varying synaptic weights of presynaptic inputs for different types of STP. Our models also capture the differences in postsynaptic spike responses to presynaptic spikes following short vs long inter-spike intervals, similar to results reported for thalamocortical connections. These models may thus be useful tools for characterizing short-term plasticity from multi-electrode spike recordings in vivo. © 2017 Ghanbari et al.",,"adaptation; Article; controlled study; nerve cell plasticity; postsynaptic potential; presynaptic potential; pyramidal nerve cell; spike wave; statistical model; stochastic model; thalamocortical tract; action potential; animal; biological model; biology; cytology; male; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; rat; visual cortex; Wistar rat; Action Potentials; Animals; Computational Biology; Male; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Neuronal Plasticity; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Visual Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030450538

Among these oscillations, hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs) are one of the most prominent. SPW-Rs occurring in the hippocampus are suggested to play essential roles in memory consolidation as well as information transfer to the neocortex. To-date, most of the knowledge about SPW-Rs comes from experimental studies averaging responses from neuronal populations monitored by conventional microelectrodes. In this work, we investigate spatiotemporal characteristics of SPW-Rs and how microelectrode size and distance influence SPW-R recordings using a biophysical model of hippocampus. We also explore contributions from neuronal spikes and synaptic potentials to SPW-Rs based on two different types of network activity. Our study suggests that neuronal spikes from pyramidal cells contribute significantly to ripples while high amplitude sharp waves mainly arise from synaptic activity. Our simulations on spatial reach of SPW-Rs show that the amplitudes of sharp waves and ripples exhibit a steep decrease with distance from the network and this effect is more prominent for smaller area electrodes. Furthermore, the amplitude of the signal decreases strongly with increasing electrode surface area as a result of averaging. The relative decrease is more pronounced when the recording electrode is closer to the source of the activity. Through simulations of field potentials across a high-density microelectrode array, we demonstrate the importance of finding the ideal spatial resolution for capturing SPW-Rs with great sensitivity. Our work provides insights on contributions from spikes and synaptic potentials to SPW-Rs and describes the effect of measurement configuration on LFPs to guide experimental studies towards improved SPW-R recordings. © 2017 Canakci et al.

Objective: To investigate the retention of laparoscopic and robotic skills after simulation training. Methods: We present the second stage of a randomized single-blinded controlled trial in which 40 simulation-naïve medical students were randomly assigned to practice peg transfer tasks on either laparoscopic (N = 20, Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery, Venture Technologies Inc., Waltham, MA) or robotic (N = 20, dV-Trainer, Mimic, Seattle, WA) platforms. In the first stage, two expert surgeons evaluated participants on both tasks before (Stage 1: Baseline) and immediately after training (Stage 1: Post-training) using a modified validated global rating scale of laparoscopic and robotic operative performance. In Stage 2, participants were evaluated on both tasks 11–20 weeks after training. Results: Of the 40 students who participated in Stage 1, 23 (11 laparoscopic and 12 robotic) underwent repeat evaluation. During Stage 2, there were no significant differences between groups in objective or subjective measures for the laparoscopic task. Laparoscopic-trained participants’ performances on the laparoscopic task were improved during Stage 2 compared to baseline measured by time to task completion, but not by the modified global rating scale.

We investigate possible bifurcation structures that arise at the onset of seizure-like activity resulting from depolarization block in inhibitory neurons. Networks of conductance-based excitatory and inhibitory neurons are simulated to characterize different types of transitions to the seizure state, and a mean field model is developed to verify the generality of the observed phenomena of excitatory-inhibitory dynamics. Specifically, the inhibitory population’s activation function in the Wilson-Cowan model is modified to be non-monotonic to reflect that inhibitory neurons enter depolarization block given strong input. We find that a physiological state and a seizure state can coexist, where the seizure state is characterized by high excitatory and low inhibitory firing rate. Bifurcation analysis of the mean field model reveals that a transition to the seizure state may occur via a saddle-node bifurcation or a homoclinic bifurcation. We explain the hysteresis observed in network simulations using these two bifurcation types. We also demonstrate that extracellular potassium concentration affects the depolarization block threshold; the consequent changes in bifurcation structure enable the network to produce the tonic to clonic phase transition observed in biological epileptic networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Depolarization block; Excitatory-inhibitory network; Seizures; Wilson-Cowan model","potassium; Article; controlled study; excitatory postsynaptic potential; firing rate; inhibitory postsynaptic potential; nerve cell membrane steady potential; phase transition; potassium cell level; priority journal; seizure; spike; action potential; biological model; epilepsy; human; nerve cell; pathophysiology; physiology; seizure; Action Potentials; Epilepsy; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Seizures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019578918

Participants completed a baseline evaluation on laparoscopic (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery Program, Los Angeles, CA) and robotic (dV-Trainer, Mimic, Seattle, WA) simulation peg transfer tasks.

The purpose of this study was to compare the energy transferred during SILS compared to traditional four-port laparoscopic surgery (TRD). Method: In a laparoscopic simulator, instruments were inserted via SILS or TRD setup. The monopolar generator delivered energy to a laparoscopic L-hook instrument for 5-s activations on 30-Watts coag mode. The primary outcome (stray current) was quantified by measuring the heat of liver tissue held adjacent to the non-electrically active 10-mm telescope tip and Maryland grasper in both the SILS and TRD setups. To control for the potential confounder of stray energy coupling via wires outside the surgical field, the camera cord and active electrode wires were oriented parallel or completely separated. Results: SILS and TRD setups create similar amounts of stray current as measured by increased tissue temperature at the non-electrically active telescope tip (41 ± 12 vs. 39 ± 10 °C; p = 0.71). Stray current was greater in SILS compared to TRD at the tip of the non-electrically active Maryland forceps (38 ± 9 vs. 20 ± 10 °C; p < 0.01). Separation of the active electrode and camera cords did not change the amount of stray energy in the SILS orientation for either telescope (39 ± 10 °C bundled vs. 36 ± 10 °C separated; p = 0.40) or grasper (38 ± 9 °C bundled vs. 34 ± 11 °C separated; p = 0.19) but did in the TRD orientation (41 ± 12 bundled vs. 24 ± 10 separated; p < 0.01). When SILS was compared to TRD with the cords separated, SILS increased stray energy at both the telescope tip and grasper tip (36 ± 10 vs. 24 ± 10 °C; p < 0.01 and 34 ± 11 vs. 17 ± 8 °C; p < 0.01). Conclusion: SILS increases stray energy transfer nearly twice as much as TRD with the use of the monopolar instrument. Strategies to mitigate the amount of stray energy in the TRD setup such as separation of the active electrode and camera cords are not effective in the SILS setup. These practical findings should enhance surgeons using the SILS approach of increased stray energy that could result in injury. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Antenna coupling; Capacitive coupling; Electrosurgery; Patient safety; Radiofrequency energy","animal tissue; Article; bovine; controlled study; energy transfer; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic access port; laparoscopic forceps; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopic surgical instrument; laparoscopy; liver tissue; Maryland; nonhuman; priority journal; simulator; telescope; thermal injury; trocar; animal; burn; devices; electrocoagulation; electrode; electrosurgery; heat; injuries; laparoscopy; liver; procedures; risk; simulation training; surgeon; surgical equipment; surgical wound; Animals; Burns; Cattle; Electrocoagulation; Electrodes; Electrosurgery; Hot Temperature; Laparoscopy; Liver; Risk; Simulation Training; Surgeons; Surgical Instruments; Surgical Wound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995802411

The first step of human biosonar is the transmission (mouth click) and subsequent reception of the resultant sound through the ear. Existing head-related transfer function (HRTF) data bases provide descriptions of reception of the resultant sound. For the current report, we collected a large database of click emissions with three blind people expertly trained in echolocation, which allowed us to perform unprecedented analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the first ever description of the spatial distribution (i.e. beam pattern) of human expert echolocation transmissions, as well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail not available before. Our data show that transmission levels are fairly constant within a 60° cone emanating from the mouth, but levels drop gradually at further angles, more than for speech. In terms of spectro-temporal features, our data show that emissions are consistently very brief (~3ms duration) with peak frequencies 2-4kHz, but with energy also at 10kHz. This differs from previous reports of durations 3-15ms and peak frequencies 2-8kHz, which were based on less detailed measurements. Based on our measurements we propose to model transmissions as sum of monotones modulated by a decaying exponential, with angular attenuation by a modified cardioid. We provide model parameters for each echolocator. These results are a step towards developing computational models of human biosonar. For example, in bats, spatial and spectro-temporal features of emissions have been used to derive and test model based hypotheses about behaviour. The data we present here suggest similar research opportunities within the context of human echolocation. Relatedly, the data are a basis to develop synthetic models of human echolocation that could be virtual (i.e. simulated) or real (i.e. loudspeaker, microphones), and which will help understanding the link between physical principles and human behaviour.",,"adult; animal; biological model; blindness; echolocation; factual database; human; male; middle aged; mouth; physiology; signal processing; sound detection; Adult; Animals; Blindness; Databases, Factual; Echolocation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Mouth; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Localization; Sound Spectrography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030616028

The details of this transfer are thought to reveal how the brain represents what it learns. Generalization has been a central focus in studies of sensorimotor adaptation, and its pattern has been well characterized: Learning of new dynamic and kinematic transformations in one region of space tapers off in a Gaussian-like fashion to neighboring untrained regions, echoing tuned population codes in the brain. In contrast to common allusions to generalization in cognitive science, generalization in visually guided reaching is usually framed as a passive consequence of neural tuning functions rather than a cognitive feature of learning. While previous research has presumed that maximum generalization occurs at the instructed task goal or the actual movement direction, recent work suggests that maximum generalization may occur at the location of an explicitly accessible movement plan. Here we provide further support for plan-based generalization, formalize this theory in an updated model of adaptation, and test several unexpected implications of the model. First, we employ a generalization paradigm to parameterize the generalization function and ascertain its maximum point. We then apply the derived generalization function to our model and successfully simulate and fit the time course of implicit adaptation across three behavioral experiments. We find that dynamics predicted by plan-based generalization are borne out in the data, are contrary to what traditional models predict, and lead to surprising implications for the behavioral, computational, and neural characteristics of sensorimotor adaptation. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Adaptation; Explicit learning; Generalization; Motor learning; Movement planning","adult; Article; behavior; explicit memory; feedback system; female; human; human experiment; learning; learning environment; male; motor learning; movement (physiology); priority journal; sensorimotor function; adaptation; adolescent; biological model; motivation; motor activity; physiology; psychophysics; sensory feedback; young adult; Adaptation, Physiological; Adolescent; Adult; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Goals; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Motor Activity; Psychophysics; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022343038

However, it has yet to be tested whether learning the dynamics of moving can transfer to the corresponding movement. Here we present a series of experiments that investigate this isometric training paradigm. Subjects were asked to hold a handle and generate forces as their arms were constrained to a static position. A precise simulation of reaching was used to make a graphic rendering of an arm moving realistically in response to the measured interaction forces and simulated environmental forces. Such graphic rendering was displayed on a horizontal display that blocked their view to their actual (statically constrained) arm and encouraged them to believe they were moving. We studied adaptation of horizontal, planar, goal-directed arm movements in a velocity-dependent force field. Our results show that individuals can learn to compensate for such a force field in a virtual environment and transfer their new skills to the actual free motion condition, with performance comparable to practice while moving. Such nonmoving techniques should impact various training conditions when moving may not be possible. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provided early evidence supporting that training movement skills without moving is possible. In contrast to previous studies, our study involves 1) exploiting cross-modal sensory interactions between vision and proprioception in a motionless setting to teach motor skills that could be transferable to a corresponding physical task, and 2) evaluates the movement skill of controlling muscle-generated forces to execute arm movements in the presence of external forces that were only virtually present during training. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Isometric; Motor adaptation; Motor learning; Visual feedback","adaptation; adult; arm movement; Article; force; human; human experiment; isometric exercise; motion; motor performance; priority journal; simulation training; velocity; virtual reality; arm; female; learning; male; motion; muscle isometric contraction; physiological feedback; physiology; task performance; Adult; Arm; Feedback, Physiological; Female; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Learning; Male; Motion; Motor Skills; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021973612

This paper proposes a new multivariate fuzzy system identification algorithm to design binary rule-based classification structures through making use of the repulsive forces between the cluster prototypes of different class labels. This approach is coupled with the potential discrimination power of each dimension in the feature space to increase the generalization potential. To address this issue, first the multivariate variant of a newly proposed soft clustering algorithm along with its mathematical foundations is proposed. Next, the discriminatory power of each individual feature is computed, using the multivariate membership values in the proposed clustering algorithm to achieve the most accurate firing degree in each rule. The main advantage of this method is to handle unbalanced datasets yielding superior true positive measure while keeping the false positive rate low enough to avoid the natural bias toward class labels containing larger number of training samples. To validate the proposed approaches, a series of numerical experiments on publicly available datasets and a real clinical dataset collected by our team were conducted. Simulation results demonstrated achievement of the primary goals of this research. © 2017","Clustering; Fuzzy systems; Multivariate analysis; System identification","Classification (of information); Fuzzy systems; Identification (control systems); Linguistics; Multivariant analysis; Religious buildings; Clustering; Discriminatory power; False positive rates; Generalization capability; Mathematical foundations; Multi variate analysis; Numerical experiments; Rule-based classification system; Clustering algorithms; accuracy; Article; calculation; classification algorithm; data analysis; fuzzy system; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; multivariate analysis; predictive value; probability; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016504556

This hypothesis has been tested previously by measuring the information transfer between brain areas, and by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling. Yet, information transfer is a function of the amount of information available in the information source—such that transfer decreases even for unchanged coupling when less source information is available. Therefore, we reconsidered past interpretations of reduced information transfer as a sign of decoupling, and asked whether impaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer. An important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in locally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced as changes in information transfer. We tested this prediction by recording local field potentials in two ferrets after administration of isoflurane in concentrations of 0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in area V1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—as predicted by our alternative hypothesis. The decrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC compared to V1. Information transfer between V1 and PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a stronger decrease from PFC to V1. This links the stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger decrease in source entropy—suggesting reduced source entropy reduces information transfer. This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic targets of isoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the synapses formed by interareal axonal projections. Thus, changes in information transfer under isoflurane seem to be a consequence of changes in local processing more than of decoupling between brain areas. We suggest that source entropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in information transfer as decoupling. © 2017 Wollstadt et al.",,"4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; isoflurane; nicotinic receptor; inhalation anesthetic agent; isoflurane; analysis of variance; anesthesia; Article; biology; consciousness disorder; correlation coefficient; electric potential; electrophysiology; entropy; information processing; nonhuman; prefrontal cortex; process optimization; protein protein interaction; simulation; spatial autocorrelation analysis; striate cortex; synapse; anesthesia; animal; chemically induced; consciousness; drug effects; female; mental function; Mustela putorius furo; pathophysiology; physiology; unconsciousness; Anesthesia; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Animals; Consciousness; Female; Ferrets; Isoflurane; Mental Processes; Prefrontal Cortex; Unconsciousness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021701625

To better understand how the human nervous system plans and controls movements, neuromechanists employ simple tasks such as upper extremity reaches and isometric force tasks. However, these simple tasks rarely consider impacts and may not capture aspects of motor control that arise from real-world complexity. Here we compared existing models of motor control with the results of a periodic targeted impact task extended from Bernstein’s seminal work: hammering a nail into wood. We recorded impact forces and kinematics from 10 subjects hammering at different frequencies and with hammers with different physical properties (mass and face area). We found few statistical differences in most measures between different types of hammer, demonstrating human robustness to minor changes in dynamics. Because human motor control is thought to obey optimality principles, we also developed a feedforward optimal simulation with a neuromechanically inspired cost function that reproduces the experimental data. However, Fitts’ Law, which relates movement time to distance traveled and target size, did not match our experimental data.

In particular, quantum dot circuits represent model systems for the study of strong electronic correlations, epitomized by the Kondo effect. We use circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures to study the internal degrees of freedom of this many-body phenomenon. Specifically, we couple a quantum dot to a high-quality-factor microwave cavity to measure with exceptional sensitivity the dot's electronic compressibility, that is, its ability to accommodate charges. Because electronic compressibility corresponds solely to the charge response of the electronic system, it is not equivalent to the conductance, which generally involves other degrees of freedom such as spin. Here, by performing dual conductance and compressibility measurements in the Kondo regime, we uncover directly the charge dynamics of this peculiar mechanism of electron transfer. The Kondo resonance, visible in transport measurements, is found to be 'transparent' to microwave photons trapped in the high-quality cavity, thereby revealing that (in such a many-body resonance) finite conduction is achieved from a charge frozen by Coulomb interaction. This freezing of charge dynamics is in contrast to the physics of a free electron gas. We anticipate that the tools of cavity quantum electrodynamics could be used in other types of mesoscopic circuits with many-body correlations, providing a model system in which to perform quantum simulation of fermion-boson problems. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In this paper, we present mechanisms of bidirectional gaze - the coordinated production and detection of gaze cues - by which a virtual character can coordinate its gaze cues with those of its human user. We implement these mechanisms in a hybrid stochastic/heuristic model synthesized from data collected in human-human interactions. In three lab studies wherein a virtual character instructs participants in a sandwich-making task, we demonstrate how bidirectional gaze can lead to positive outcomes in error rate, completion time, and the agent's ability to produce quick, effective nonverbal references. The first study involved an on-screen agent and the participant wearing eye-tracking glasses. The second study demonstrates that these positive outcomes can be achieved using head-pose estimation in place of full eye tracking. The third study demonstrates that these effects also transfer into virtual-reality interactions. © 2017 ACM.","Bidirectional gaze; Dyadic gaze; Embodied agents; Gaze coordination; Interactive gaze; Joint attention; Verbal referencing","Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Image recognition; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Virtual reality; Bidirectional gaze; Dyadic gaze; Embodied agent; Gaze coordination; Interactive gaze; Joint attention; Verbal referencing; Eye tracking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030750059

Among the most defining features of grid-cell activity are the 60° rotational symmetry of grids and preservation of grid scale across environments. Grid cells, however, do display a limited degree of adaptation to environments. It remains unclear if this level of environment invariance generalizes to human grid-cell analogs, where the relative contribution of visual input to the multimodal sensory input of the EC is significantly larger than in rodents. Patients diagnosed with nontractable epilepsy who were implanted with entorhinal cortical electrodes performing virtual navigation tasks to memorized locations enabled us to investigate associations between grid-like patterns and environment. Here, we report that the activity of human entorhinal cortical neurons exhibits adaptive scaling in grid period, grid orientation, and rotational symmetry in close association with changes in environment size, shape, and visual cues, suggesting scale invariance of the frequency, rather than the wavelength, of spatially periodic activity. Our results demonstrate that neurons in the human EC represent space with an enhanced flexibility relative to neurons in rodents because they are endowed with adaptive scalability and context dependency.","Entorhinal cortex; Grid cell; Human; Single unit; Spatial memory","adult; Article; case report; entorhinal cortex; epilepsy; female; firing rate; grid cell; human; human cell; male; microelectrode; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; single unit activity; spatial memory; spatial memory test; spatial orientation; video game; virtual reality; entorhinal cortex; nerve cell; pathology; pathophysiology; Adult; Entorhinal Cortex; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Male; Neurons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018821987

This strict requirement is relaxed for van der Waals epitaxy, in which epitaxy on layered or two-dimensional (2D) materials is mediated by weak van der Waals interactions, and which also allows facile layer release from 2D surfaces. It has been thought that 2D materials are the only seed layers for van der Waals epitaxy. However, the substrates below 2D materials may still interact with the layers grown during epitaxy (epilayers), as in the case of the so-called wetting transparency documented for graphene. Here we show that the weak van der Waals potential of graphene cannot completely screen the stronger potential field of many substrates, which enables epitaxial growth to occur despite its presence. We use density functional theory calculations to establish that adatoms will experience remote epitaxial registry with a substrate through a substrate-epilayer gap of up to nine ångströms; this gap can accommodate a monolayer of graphene. We confirm the predictions with homoepitaxial growth of GaAs(001) on GaAs(001) substrates through monolayer graphene, and show that the approach is also applicable to InP and GaP. The grown single-crystalline films are rapidly released from the graphene-coated substrate and perform as well as conventionally prepared films when incorporated in light-emitting devices. This technique enables any type of semiconductor film to be copied from underlying substrates through 2D materials, and then the resultant epilayer to be rapidly released and transferred to a substrate of interest. This process is particularly attractive in the context of non-silicon electronics and photonics, where the ability to re-use the graphene-coated substrates allows savings on the high cost of non-silicon substrates. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Differential co-expression analysis helps further detect alterations of regulatory activities in case/control comparison. Co-expression networks estimated from single transcriptomic study is often unstable and not generalizable due to cohort bias and limited sample size. With the rapid accumulation of publicly available transcriptomic studies, co-expression analysis combining multiple transcriptomic studies can provide more accurate and robust results. Results: In this paper, we propose a meta-analytic framework for detecting differentially co-expressed networks (MetaDCN). Differentially co-expressed seed modules are first detected by optimizing an energy function via simulated annealing. Basic modules sharing common pathways are merged into pathway-centric supermodules and a Cytoscape plug-in (MetaDCNExplorer) is developed to visualize and explore the findings. We applied MetaDCN to two breast cancer applications: ER+/ER- comparison using five training and three testing studies, and ILC/IDC comparison with two training and two testing studies. We identified 20 and 4 supermodules for ER+/ER- and ILC/IDC comparisons, respectively. Ranking atop are 'immune response pathway' and 'complement cascades pathway' for ER comparison, and 'extracellular matrix pathway' for ILC/IDC comparison. Without the need for prior information, the results from MetaDCN confirm existing as well as discover novel disease mechanisms in a systems manner. © 2016 The Author.

This subsequently affects how stimuli are associated with meanings and behaviors. Here, human listeners were trained with frequency-modulated (FM) tonal sweeps (500–1000 Hz) in a paradigm where one FM rate (8.29 octaves per second) required a ‘Target’ response, while a rate either slower (5.76 octaves per second) or faster (11.94 octaves per second) required a ‘Non-Target’ response. Training led to a shift in ‘Target’ responding along the FM rate dimension away from the ‘Target’ in a direction opposite the trained ‘Non-Target’. This peak shift was paralleled by an asymmetry in acuity along the FM rate dimension in an untrained ABX task (a.k.a. match-to-sample). Performance improved relative to pre-training on trials where the ‘Target’ was contrasted with stimuli nearer the trained ‘Non-Target’. Performance worsened on trials containing stimuli displaced along the FM dimension further from the trained ‘Non-Target’. A connectionist model of perceptual learning containing non-associative representational modification and associative-based task-specific reweighting was able to simulate behavior. Simulations generated novel testable predictions regarding peak shift and worsening as a result of discrimination learning. Data have theoretical and practical consequences for predicting trends in the generalization of learned behaviors and modifiable perceptual acuities. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Connectionism; Discrimination learning; Negative generalization; Self-organizing map (SOM); Transfer","adult; Article; behavior; conditioning; discrimination learning; female; frequency modulation; human; learning; male; network learning; normal human; perception; perceptual learning; prediction; priority journal; simulation; task performance; training; auditory stimulation; hearing; learning; physiology; psychological model; psychophysics; young adult; Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Auditory Perception; Discrimination Learning; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Psychoacoustics; Transfer (Psychology); Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012165244

The proposed locally-constrained CCA (cCCA) model is formulated in terms of a multivariate constrained optimization problem and solved efficiently with numerical optimization techniques. To evaluate the performance of this cCCA model, simulated data are generated with a Signal-To-Noise Ratio of 0.25, which is realistic to the noise level contained in episodic memory fMRI data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods are used to compare the performance of different models. The cCCA model with optimum parameters (called optimum-cCCA) obtains the largest area under the ROC curve. Furthermore, a novel validation method is proposed to validate the selected optimum-cCCA parameters based on ROC from simulated data and real fMRI data. Results for optimum-cCCA are then compared with conventional fMRI analysis methods using data from an episodic memory task. Wavelet-resampled resting-state data are used to obtain the null distribution of activation. For simulated data, accuracy in detecting activation increases for the optimum-cCCA model by about 43% as compared to the single voxel analysis with comparable Gaussian smoothing. Results from the real fMRI data set indicate a significant increase in activation detection, particularly in hippocampus, para-hippocampal area and nearby medial temporal lobe regions with the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Constrained canonical correlation analysis (cCCA); Episodic memory task; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); Multivariate analysis; Numerical optimization","Article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; dentate gyrus; dentate hilus; entorhinal cortex; episodic memory; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA2 region; hippocampal CA3 region; human; image processing; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; normal distribution; parahippocampal gyrus; process optimization; receiver operating characteristic; resting state network; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; subiculum; task performance; algorithm; area under the curve; biological model; brain mapping; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Brain Mapping; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011407810

However, independent vector analysis (IVA), which has exhibited great potential for group analysis of magnitude-only fMRI data, has rarely been applied to complex-valued fMRI data. The main challenges in this application include the extremely noisy nature and large variability of the source component vector (SCV) distribution. New method To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive fixed-point IVA algorithm for analyzing multiple-subject complex-valued fMRI data. We exploited a multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution (MGGD)- based nonlinear function to match varying SCV distributions in which the MGGD shape parameter was estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. To achieve our de-noising goal, we updated the MGGD-based nonlinearity in the dominant SCV subspace, and employed a post-IVA de-noising strategy based on phase information in the IVA estimates. We also incorporated the pseudo-covariance matrix of fMRI data into the algorithm to emphasize the noncircularity of complex-valued fMRI sources. Results Results from simulated and experimental fMRI data demonstrated the efficacy of our method. Comparison with existing method(s) Our approach exhibited significant improvements over typical complex-valued IVA algorithms, especially during higher noise levels and larger spatial and temporal changes. As expected, the proposed complex-valued IVA algorithm detected more contiguous and reasonable activations than the magnitude-only method for task-related (393%) and default mode (301%) spatial maps. Conclusions The proposed approach is suitable for decomposing multi-subject complex-valued fMRI data, and has great potential for capturing additional subject variability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Complex-valued fMRI data; Independent vector analysis (IVA); MGGD; Noncircularity; Post-IVA phase de-noising; Shape parameter; Subspace de-noising","algorithm; Article; brain; brain mapping; contrast to noise ratio; controlled study; covariance; data analysis; default mode network; diagnostic value; finger tapping test; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; human experiment; independent vector analysis; maximum likelihood method; multivariate analysis; noise; nonlinear system; normal distribution; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; radiological parameters; signal processing; spatial memory; task performance; temporal summation; voxel based morphometry; artifact; biological model; brain mapping; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; finger; hearing; motor activity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; rest; statistical model; Algorithms; Artifacts; Auditory Perception; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Fingers; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; Motor Activity; Multivariate Analysis; Nonlinear Dynamics; Rest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014874142

Methods: Sixty-eight participants, 53 residents and 15 attending surgeons, performed the Top Gun Pea Drop, FLS Peg Pass, intracorporeal suturing, and two video games (SMB and U). SMB is an over-the-counter game, and U was formulated for laparoscopic skill training. Results: Spearman’s rank correlations were performed looking at performance comparing the three validated laparoscopic training tasks, and SMB/U. The SMB score had a moderate correlation with intracorporeal suturing (ρ = 0.39, p < 0.01), and the finalscore involving all three tasks (ρ = 0.39, p < 0.01), but low correlations with Pea Drop Drill and FLS Peg Transfer (ρ = 0.11, 0.18, p < 0.01). The U score had a small correlation with intracorporeal suturing and final score (ρ = 0.09, 0.13, p < 0.01). However, there were correlations between U score and Pea Drop Drill, and FLS Peg Transfer (ρ = 0.24, 0.27, p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: In this study, SMB had a very significant correlation with intracorporeal suturing. U demonstrated more of a correlation with basic skills. At this point, our conclusion would be that both are effective for laparoscopic skill training, and they should be used in tandem rather than alone. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Intracorporeal suturing; Minimally invasive surgical skills; Video games","Article; experience; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; resident; surgeon; surgical training; suture technique; video game; adult; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; devices; education; laparoscopy; medical education; standards; surgeon; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Surgeons; Suture Techniques; User-Computer Interface; Video Games",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986309700

The goal is to enable the network traffic to flow smoothly through the underlying network, resulting in an optimal quality of experience to the end-users. Proper chaining of network functions leads to optimal utilization of distributed resources. This has been a de-facto model in the telecom industry with network functions deployed over underlying hardware. Though this model has served the telecom industry well so far, it has been adapted mostly to suit the static behavior of network services and service demands due to the deployment of the services directly over physical resources. This results in network ossification with larger delays to the end-users, especially with the data-centric model in which the computational resources are moving closer to end users. A novel networking paradigm, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), meets the user demands dynamically and reduces operational expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx), by implementing network functions in the software layer known as virtual network functions (VNFs). VNFs are then interconnected to form a complete end-to-end service, also known as service function chains (SFCs). In this work, we study the problem of deploying service function chains over network function virtualized architecture. Specifically, we study virtual network function placement problem for the optimal SFC formation across geographically distributed clouds. We set up the problem of minimizing inter-cloud traffic and response time in a multi-cloud scenario as an ILP optimization problem, along with important constraints such as total deployment costs and service level agreements (SLAs). We consider link delays and computational delays in our model. The link queues are modeled as M/D/1 (single server/Poisson arrival/deterministic service times) and server queues as M/M/1 (single server/Poisson arrival/exponential service times) based on the statistical analysis. In addition, we present a novel affinity-based approach (ABA) to solve the problem for larger networks. We provide a performance comparison between the proposed heuristic and simple greedy approach (SGA) used in the state-of-the-art systems. Greedy approach has already been widely studied in the literature for the VM placement problem. Especially we compare our proposed heuristic with a greedy approach using first-fit decreasing (FFD) method. By observing the results, we conclude that the affinity-based approach for placing the service functions in the network produces better results compared against the simple greedy (FFD) approach in terms of both, total delays and total resource cost. We observe that with a little compromise (gap of less than 10% of the optimal) in the solution quality (total delays and cost), affinity-based heuristic can solve the larger problem more quickly than ILP. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Affinity; Greedy; Multi-cloud; Network function virtualization; Optimal placement; Service function chaining","Chains; Costs; Heuristic methods; Network architecture; Optimization; Problem solving; Quality of service; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Affinity; Greedy; Multi-clouds; Optimal placements; Service functions; Network function virtualization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014078758

Each of these steps typically requires the solution of an ill-posed inverse problem and thus necessitates additional regularization. Recently developed single-step QSM algorithms directly relate the unprocessed GRE phase to the unknown susceptibility distribution, thereby requiring the solution of a single inverse problem. In this work, we show that such a holistic approach provides susceptibility estimation with artifact mitigation and develop efficient algorithms that involve simple analytical solutions for all of the optimization steps. Our methods employ total variation (TV) and total generalized variation (TGV) to jointly perform the background removal and dipole inversion in a single step. Using multiple spherical mean value (SMV) kernels of varying radii permits high-fidelity background removal whilst retaining the phase information in the cortex. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed single-step methods reduce the reconstruction error by up to 66% relative to the multi-step methods that involve SMV background filtering with the same number of SMV kernels, followed by TV- or TGV-regularized dipole inversion. In vivo single-step experiments demonstrate a dramatic reduction in dipole streaking artifacts and improved homogeneity of image contrast. These acquisitions employ the rapid three-dimensional echo planar imaging (3D EPI) and Wave-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) trajectories for signal-to-noise ratio-efficient whole-brain imaging. Herein, we also demonstrate the multi-echo capability of the Wave-CAIPI sequence for the first time, and introduce an automated, phase-sensitive coil sensitivity estimation scheme based on a 4-s calibration acquisition.

These whales exhibit continuous filtration, namely, with the mouth kept partially opened and the baleen exposed to oncoming prey-laden waters while fluking. The process is an example of crossflow filtration (CFF) in which most of the particulates (prey) are separated from the substrate (water) without ever coming into contact with the filtering surface (baleen). This paper discusses the simulation of baleen filtration hydrodynamics based on a type of hydraulic circuit modeling commonly used in microfluidics, but adapted to the much higher Reynolds number flows typical of whale hydrodynamics. This so-called Baleen Hydraulic Circuit (BHC) model uses as input the basic characteristics of the flows moving through a section of baleen observed in a previous flume study by the authors. The model has low-spatial resolution but incorporates the effects of fluid viscosity, which doubles or more a whale's total body drag in comparison to non-feeding travel. Modeling viscous friction is crucial here since exposing the baleen system to the open ocean ends up tripling a whale's total wetted surface area. Among other findings, the BHC shows how CFF is enhanced by a large filtration surface and hence large body size; how it is carried out via the establishment of rapid anteroposterior flows transporting most of the prey-water slurry towards the oropharyngeal wall; how slower intra-baleen flows manage to transfer most of the substrate out of the mouth, all the while contributing only a fraction to overall oral cavity drag; and how these anteroposterior and intra-baleen flows lose speed as they approach the oropharyngeal wall. © 2017 Potvin, Werth.

Linear energy transfer (LET) has been scored from energy deposits in a cell nucleus; for very low-energy ions, it has been defined locally within thin slabs. The simulations show that protons and helium ions induce more DNA damage than heavier ions do at the same LET.

We can recognize these action categories across variations in actors, objects, and settings; moreover, we can recognize them from both dynamic and static visual input. However, the neural systems that support action recognition across these perceptual differences are unclear. Here, we used multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to identify brain regions that support visual action categorization in a formatindependent way. Human participants were scanned while viewing eight categories of interactions (e.g., pulling) depicted in two visual formats: (1) visually controlled videos of two interacting actors and (2) visually varied photographs selected from the internet involving different actors, objects, and settings. Action category was decodable across visual formats in bilateral inferior parietal, bilateral occipitotemporal, left premotor, and left middle frontal cortex.

The Langmuir waves are modulated by solitary waves in the linear stage and electrostatic whistler waves in the nonlinear stage. Modulational instability leads to Langmuir collapse and electron heating that fills in cavitons. The high pressure is released via excitation of a short-wavelength ion acoustic mode that is damped by electrons and reexcites small-scale Langmuir waves; this process closes a feedback loop that maintains the continuous coherent emission. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

In this study, we developed a forward genetic screen for the identification of host factors required for antiviral RNAi in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using whole-genome sequencing and a computational pipeline, we identified aminophospholipid transporting ATPase 2 (ALA2) and the related ALA1 in the type IV subfamily of P-Type ATPases as key components of antiviral RNAi. ALA1 and ALA2 are flippases, which are transmembrane lipid transporter proteins that transport phospholipids across cellular membranes. We found that the ala1/ala2 single-And double-mutant plants exhibited enhanced disease susceptibility to cucumber mosaic virus when the virus-encoded function to suppress RNAi was disrupted. Notably, the antiviral activity of both ALA1 and ALA2 was abolished by a single amino acid substitution known to inactivate the flippase activity. Genetic analysis revealed that ALA1 and ALA2 acted to enhance the amplification of the viral siRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 1 (RDR1) and RDR6 and of the endogenous virus-Activated siRNAs by RDR1. RNA virus replication by plant viral RdRPs occurs inside vesicle-like membrane invaginations induced by the recruitment of the viral RdRP and host factors to subcellular membrane microdomains enriched with specific phospholipids. Our results suggest that the phospholipid transporter activity of ALA1/ALA2 may be necessary for the formation of similar invaginations for the synthesis of dsRNA precursors of highly abundant viral and host siRNAs by the cellular RdRPs.","Cucumber mosaic virus; Lipid flippase; Mutcan; RNA interference; Viral siRNAs","adenosine triphosphatase; alanine; amino acid; aminophospholipid; antivirus agent; carrier protein; lipid; lipid flippase; phospholipid; RNA directed RNA polymerase; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis protein; phospholipid; phospholipid transfer protein; RdRP1 protein, Arabidopsis; small interfering RNA; amino acid substitution; antiviral activity; Arabidopsis; Article; biogenesis; cell membrane; chemical structure; Cucumber mosaic virus; disease predisposition; gene amplification; gene mutation; gene silencing; genetic screening; nonhuman; phospholipid transfer; plant defense; plant development; plant genetics; priority journal; RNA interference; RNA virus; virus replication; whole genome sequencing; Arabidopsis; Cucumovirus; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; mutation; physiology; plant disease; RNA interference; transgenic plant; virology; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cucumovirus; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Mutation; Phospholipid Transfer Proteins; Phospholipids; Plant Diseases; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA Interference; RNA Replicase; RNA, Small Interfering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011685134

The pore space is filled with bone marrow, a highly cellular fluid. Together, the bone and marrow behave as a poroelastic solid. In poroelasticity theory, the permeability is the primary material property that governs the momentum transfer between the solid and fluid constituents. In the linearized theory, the permeability of a material depends on the shape and connectivity of the pores. Developing a model of the relationship between trabecular microarchitecture and permeability could lead to improved simulations of trabecular bone mechanical response, which can be used to investigate bone adaptation, mechanobiological signaling, and progression of diseases such as osteoporosis. This study used finite element models of the trabecular pore space to calculate the complete anisotropic permeability tensor of 12 human and 18 porcine femoral trabecular bone samples. The sensitivity of the simulations to model assumptions and post-processing was analyzed to improve confidence in the result. The orthotropic permeability tensor depended on the fabric tensor, trabecular spacing, and structure model index through a power law relationship.

Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is a powerful tool to investigate the neural mechanisms of perception and can be used to restore sensation for patients who have lost it. While sensitivity to ICMS has previously been characterized, no systematic framework has been developed to summarize the detectability of individual ICMS pulse trains or the discriminability of pairs of pulse trains. Approach. We develop a simple simulation that describes the responses of a population of neurons to a train of electrical pulses delivered through a microelectrode. We then perform an ideal observer analysis on the simulated population responses to predict the behavioral performance of non-human primates in ICMS detection and discrimination tasks. Main results. Our computational model can predict behavioral performance across a wide range of stimulation conditions with high accuracy (R 2 = 0.97) and generalizes to novel ICMS pulse trains that were not used to fit its parameters. Furthermore, the model provides a theoretical basis for the finding that amplitude discrimination based on ICMS violates Weber's law. Significance. The model can be used to characterize the sensitivity to ICMS across the range of perceptible and safe stimulation regimes. As such, it will be a useful tool for both neuroscience and neuroprosthetics. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","computational model; detection; discrimination; intracortical microstimulation; non-human primates; psychophysics","Computational methods; Error detection; Mammals; Microelectrodes; Computational model; discrimination; Microstimulation; Non-human primate; psychophysics; Computation theory; animal experiment; Article; behavior; brain depth stimulation; chronaxy; comparative study; evoked response; forced choice method; intracortical microstimulation; membrane potential; microelectrode; nerve cell; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; refractory period; rhesus monkey; task performance; action potential; animal; biological model; brain; brain depth stimulation; computer simulation; human; male; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; Action Potentials; Animals; Brain; Computer Simulation; Deep Brain Stimulation; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Macaca mulatta; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010383614

S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Providence, RI, United States","Point process generalized linear models (PP-GLMs) provide an important statistical framework for modeling spiking activity in single-neurons and neuronal networks. Stochastic stability is essential when sampling from these models, as done in computational neuroscience to analyze statistical properties of neuronal dynamics and in neuro-engineering to implement closed-loop applications. Here we show, however, that despite passing common goodness-of-fit tests, PP-GLMs estimated from data are often unstable, leading to divergent firing rates. The inclusion of absolute refractory periods is not a satisfactory solution since the activity then typically settles into unphysiological rates. To address these issues, we derive a framework for determining the existence and stability of fixed points of the expected conditional intensity function (CIF) for general PP-GLMs. Specifically, in nonlinear Hawkes PP-GLMs, the CIF is expressed as a function of the previous spike history and exogenous inputs. We use a mean-field quasi-renewal (QR) approximation that decomposes spike history effects into the contribution of the last spike and an average of the CIF over all spike histories prior to the last spike. Fixed points for stationary rates are derived as self-consistent solutions of integral equations. Bifurcation analysis and the number of fixed points predict that the original models can show stable, divergent, and metastable (fragile) dynamics. For fragile models, fluctuations of the single-neuron dynamics predict expected divergence times after which rates approach unphysiologically high values. This metric can be used to estimate the probability of rates to remain physiological for given time periods, e.g., for simulation purposes. We demonstrate the use of the stability framework using simulated single-neuron examples and neurophysiological recordings. Finally, we show how to adapt PP-GLM estimation procedures to guarantee model stability.

The purpose of this study was to use a secondary task to measure the incremental workload demands of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) procedures versus traditional laparoscopic procedures. Method 12 surgery residents and surgical assistants who had met FLS criteria on an FLS and SILS simulator performed one trial each of peg transfer, cutting, and intracorporeal suturing tasks simultaneously with the secondary task and provided subjective workload ratings using the NASA-TLX. Results SILS procedures resulted in lower primary and secondary task scores, p < 0.001 and higher workload ratings, p < 0.0001. Suturing resulted in lower primary (p < 0.003) and secondary task scores (p < 0.017) and higher workload ratings (p < 0.017) compared to the other tasks. Conclusions SILS procedures were significantly more mentally demanding than traditional laparoscopic procedures corroborated by primary and secondary tasks scores and subjective ratings. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Laparoscopy; Mental workload; Secondary task; Single incision surgery; Skill","Article; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; mental task; priority journal; resident; simulator; single incision laparoscopic surgery; suture technique; task performance; workload; attention; clinical competence; cognition; education; laparoscopy; procedures; simulation training; task performance; Attention; Clinical Competence; Cognition; Humans; Laparoscopy; Simulation Training; Task Performance and Analysis; Workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994462657

This concept remains controversial and lacks direct experimental support in intact cells. Here, we visualize ordered and disordered domains in mouse B lymphoma cell membranes using super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy, demonstrate that clustered BCR resides within ordered phase-like domains capable of sorting key regulators of BCR activation, and present a minimal, predictive model where clustering receptors leads to their collective activation by stabilizing an extended ordered domain. These results provide evidence for the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling and a plausible mechanism of BCR activation via receptor clustering that could be generalized to other signaling pathways.

Somatically acquired SV may regulate the expression of tumor-related genes and result in cell proliferation and uncontrolled growth, eventually inducing tumor formation. Virus integration with host genome sequence is a type of SV that causes the related gene instability and normal cells to transform into tumor cells. Cancer SVs and viral integration sites must be discovered in a genome-wide scale for clarifying the mechanism of tumor occurrence and development. Results: In this paper, we propose a new tool called seeksv to detect somatic SVs and viral integration events. Seeksv simultaneously uses split read signal, discordant paired-end read signal, read depth signal and the fragment with two ends unmapped. Seeksv can detect DEL, insertion, inversion and inter-chromosome transfer at single-nucleotide resolution. Different types of sequencing data, such as single-end sequencing data or paired-end sequencing data can accommodate to detect SV. Seeksv develops a rescue model for SV with breakpoints located in sequence homology regions. Results on simulated and real data from the 1000 Genomes Project and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples show that seeksv has higher efficiency and precision compared with other similar software in detecting SVs. For the discovery of hepatitis B virus integration sites from probe capture data, the verified experiments show that more than 90% viral integration sequences detected by seeksv are true. © The Author 2017.

Literature shows that the young novice drivers are not careless drivers but they are clueless drivers' - clueless because of their inability to predict the risk ahead of time that might materialize on the forward roadway. Other error-feedback training programs exist that emphasize the teaching of risk awareness and perception skills to young drivers. In the current study, a Virtual reality based risk awareness and perception training program (V-RAPT) was developed on the Oculus Rift and evaluated on a driving simulator. The training program provides 360 degrees' views of 6 high risk driving scenarios towards training the young driver to anticipate and mitigate latent hazards. Twenty-four participants in three experiment groups were trained on one of 3 training programs-VRAPT, RAPT and Control, and were evaluated on a driving simulator. Eye movements were collected throughout the experiment. The simulator evaluation drives included six near-transfer scenarios used in the training and four far-transfer scenarios not used in the training but validated previously in other similar studies. The young drivers trained on the V-RAPT were found to anticipate a significantly greater proportion (86.25%) of the potential latent hazards as compared to the RAPT trained young drivers (62.36%) and control trained drivers (30.97%). The VR-based training program is shown to be effective in improving young drivers' ability to anticipate latent threats.

This behavior transfers into social interactions in virtual environments. These systems are becoming an increasingly common platform for training, so it is critical to understand how biases will impact them. The present study investigates the effect of the ethnicity bias on error behaviors within a virtual world for medical triage training. Two between subjects variables, participant skin tone (light, dark) and avatar skin tone (light, dark), and one within subjects variable, agent/patient skin tone (light, dark), were manipulated to create a 2 × 2 × 2 mixed design with four conditions. Effects on errors were observed on errors made while helping patient (agents). Participants made considerably more errors while triaging dark-skinned agents which increased the amount of time spent on them, in comparison to light-skinned agents. Within a virtual world for training, people apply general ethnic biases against dark-skinned individuals, which is important to consider when designing such systems because the biases could impact the effectiveness of the training.

With the development and continued improvement of 3D video technology, the potential benefit of restoring 3D vision to laparoscopy has received substantial attention from the surgical community. Despite this, procedures conducted under 2D vision remain the standard of care, and trainees must become proficient in 2D laparoscopy. This study aims to determine whether incorporating 3D vision into a 2D laparoscopic simulation curriculum accelerates skill acquisition in novices. Design Postgraduate year-1 surgical specialty residents (n = 15) at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, at Western University were randomized into 1 of 2 groups. The control group practiced the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery peg-transfer task to proficiency exclusively under standard 2D laparoscopy conditions. The experimental group first practiced peg transfer under 3D direct visualization, with direct visualization of the working field. Upon reaching proficiency, this group underwent a perceptual switch, changing to standard 2D laparoscopy conditions, and once again trained to proficiency. Results Incorporating 3D direct visualization before training under standard 2D conditions significantly (p < 0.0.5) reduced the total training time to proficiency by 10.9 minutes or 32.4%. There was no difference in total number of repetitions to proficiency. Data were also used to generate learning curves for each respective training protocol. Conclusions An adaptive learning approach, which incorporates 3D direct visualization into a 2D laparoscopic simulation curriculum, accelerates skill acquisition. This is in contrast to previous work, possibly owing to the proficiency-based methodology employed, and has implications for resource savings in surgical training. © 2016","3D visualization; adaptive training; FLS; laparoscopy; skill acquisition","adult; Article; controlled study; curriculum; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; learning curve; male; postgraduate education; priority journal; resident; simulation training; surgical training; three dimensional imaging; clinical competence; comparative study; depth perception; education; laparoscopy; medical education; Ontario; procedures; randomized controlled trial; simulation training; three dimensional imaging; three dimensional printing; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Depth Perception; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Learning Curve; Male; Ontario; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Simulation Training; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000399389

The nonspecific plasticity these neuromodulators may induce at neighboring non-active synapses is thought to be detrimental from the specificity of memory storage. We show here that memory retrieval may benefit from this non-specific plasticity when the applied sparse binary input patterns are degraded by local noise. Simulations of a biophysically realistic model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell in a pattern recognition task show that, in the absence of noise, leakage of plasticity to adjacent synapses degrades the recognition of sparse static patterns. However, above a local noise level of 20%, the model with nonspecific plasticity outperforms the standard, specific model. The gain in performance is greatest when the spatial distribution of noise in the input matches the range of diffusion-induced plasticity. Hence non-specific plasticity may offer a benefit in noisy environments or when the pressure to generalize is strong. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"diffusion; human; human cell; human experiment; information retrieval; memory; nerve cell plasticity; noise; pattern recognition; Purkinje cell; simulation; action potential; algorithm; animal; biological model; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; synapse; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Humans; Memory; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Pattern Recognition, Physiological; Purkinje Cells; Synapses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038830873

Specifically, in the naval warfare domain, it relates the way he processes a large amount of information in dynamic, uncertain environments, allocates resources, and chooses appropriate actions to pursue. In this paper, we describe an approach to capture a Commander's decision style by creating a cognitive model that captures his decisionmaking process and evaluate this model using a set of scenarios using an online naval warfare simulation game. In this model, we use the Commander's past behaviors and generalize Commander's actions across multiple problems and multiple decision making sequences in order to recommend actions to a Commander in a manner that he may have taken. Our approach builds upon the Double Transition Model to represent the Commander's focus and beliefs to estimate his cognitive state. Each cognitive state reflects a stage in a Commander's decision making process, each action reflects the tasks that he has taken to move himself closer to a final decision, and the reward reflects how close he is to achieving his goal. We then use inverse reinforcement learning to compute a reward for each of the Commander's actions. These rewards and cognitive states are used to compare between different styles of decision making. We construct a set of scenarios in the game where rational, intuitive and spontaneous decision making styles will be evaluated. © 2017 SPIE.","cognitive states; Decision making process; Double Transition Model; inverse optimal control; inverse reinforcement learning","Education; Law enforcement; National security; Naval warfare; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Security systems; Cognitive state; Decision making process; Inverse reinforcement learning; Inverse-optimal control; Transition model; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025141788

Whether operators, end-users, or bystanders, human responses can determine the perceived utility and acceptance of an automation. It has been long believed that human trust is a primary determinant of human-automation interactions and further presumed that calibrating trust can lead to appropriate choices regarding automation use. However, attempts to improve joint system performance by calibrating trust have not yet provided a generalizable solution. To address this, we identified several factors limiting the direct integration of trust, or metrics thereof, into an active mitigation strategy. The present paper outlines our approach to addressing this important issue, its conceptual underpinnings, and practical challenges encountered in execution. Among the most critical outcomes has been a shift in focus from trust to basic interaction behaviors and their antecedent decisions. This change in focus inspired the development of a testbed and paradigm that was deployed in two experiments of human interactions with driving automation that were executed in an immersive, full-motion simulation environment. Moreover, by integrating a behavior and physiology-based predictor within a novel consequence-based control system, we demonstrated that it is possible to anticipate particular interaction behaviors and influence humans towards more optimal choices about automation use in real time. Importantly, this research provides a fertile foundation for the development and integration of advanced, wearable technologies for sensing and inferring critical state variables for better integration of human elements into otherwise fully autonomous systems. © 2017 SPIE.","Human-Automation Interaction; Trust in Automation; Decision-Making; Consequence-Based Control; Motion-Based Simulation; EEG; Psychophysiology; Privileged Sensing Framework","Critical current density (superconductivity); Integration; Man machine systems; Nanotechnology; Physiology; Wearable technology; Autonomous systems; Direct integration; Human interactions; Human-automation interactions; Interaction behavior; Mitigation strategy; Motion simulations; Perceived utility; Automation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024402214

Unfortunately, these devices are inefficient, operating at only 7% efficiency. This low efficiency has driven efforts to make high-figure-of-merit thermoelectric devices, which require a high electrical conductivity but a low thermal conductivity, a combination that is difficult to achieve. Lowered thermal conductivity has increased efficiency, but at the cost of power output. An alternative setup is to use metallic junctions rather than semiconductors as thermoelectric devices. Metals have orders of magnitude more electrons and electronic conductivities higher than semiconductors, but thermal conductivity is higher as well. To evaluate the viability of metallic junction thermoelectrics, a two dimensional heat transfer MATLAB simulation was constructed to calculate efficiency and power output. High Seebeck coefficient alloys, Chromel (90%Ni- 10%Cr) and Constantan (55%Cu-45%Ni), produced efficiencies of around 20-30%. Parameters such as the number of layers of junctions, lateral junction density, and junction sizes for both series- and parallel-connected junctions were explored. © 2017 SPIE.","Microfabrication; Nanofabrication; Seebeck Effect; Simulation; Thermal power generation; Thermoelectrics","Biosensors; Electric conductivity; MATLAB; Metals; Microfabrication; Nanosensors; Nanotechnology; Nickel; Nuclear batteries; Seebeck effect; Space flight; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; High electrical conductivity; Low thermal conductivity; Radioisotope thermoelectric generators; Simulation; Thermal power generation; Thermoelectric junctions; Thermoelectrics; Two-dimensional heat transfer; Semiconductor junctions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024105956

After pharmacy students in 2 previous years of testing failed to adequately assess and plan for the care of a standardized patient’s chief complaint and disability in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), the investigators added debriefing to the OSCE to determine if it would improve student’s ability to assess and plan for the care of PWD. Methods: Two sequentially enrolled second-year pharmacy school student cohorts participated in this study (control n = 90; intervention n = 82). During the OSCE, students interviewed and examined a standardized patient with a simulated physical disability and other chronic disease states. Students were then instructed to develop a care plan considering the patient’s disability and other disease states. The intervention cohort received debriefing; the control did not. Students documented the care plan in a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note. Investigators assessed SOAP note score (general ability of students to write a SOAP note) and CS score (specific ability to care for PWD) to determine the effectiveness of the debriefing. Results: The intervention group showed a significantly higher percent mean CS score than the control group (93.6% 19% and 61.1% 30.7%, respectively, P < 0.001), translating to a mean of 56.2/60 points earned for the intervention group and 36.7/ 60 points earned for the control group. Scores ranged from 0 to 60 points for both intervention and control groups. Students in the intervention group had an absolute improvement in pass rates (those students scoring 70% on the OSCE) of 59.4% with 92.7% of the students passing in the intervention group versus 33.3% of the students passing in the control group (P < 0.001). The overall SOAP note scores were no different between the 2 cohorts (P = 0.353). Conclusions: Debriefing added to an OSCE improved students’ performance in developing care plans for disabled patients. Ideally, longitudinal studies should be completed to determine if these skills transfer from debriefings to clinical practice. Development of effective training and assessment methods is essential for students to obtain adequate skills and knowledge to care for persons with disabilities.

Data sets from severely contaminated locations can therefore be small. Moreover, many potentially important factors, such as soil concentrations of toxic chemicals, pH, and temperature, can be correlated with radiation levels and with each other. In such situations, commonly-used statistical techniques like generalized linear models (GLMs) may not be able to provide useful information about how radiation and/or these other variables affect the outcome (e.g. abundance of the studied organisms). Ensemble machine learning methods such as random forests offer powerful alternatives. We propose that analysis of small radioecological data sets by GLMs and/or machine learning can be made more informative by using the following techniques: (1) adding synthetic noise variables to provide benchmarks for distinguishing the performances of valuable predictors from irrelevant ones; (2) adding noise directly to the predictors and/or to the outcome to test the robustness of analysis results against random data fluctuations; (3) adding artificial effects to selected predictors to test the sensitivity of the analysis methods in detecting predictor effects; (4) running a selected machine learning method multiple times (with different random-number seeds) to test the robustness of the detected ""signal""; (5) using several machine learning methods to test the ""signal's"" sensitivity to differences in analysis techniques. Here, we applied these approaches to simulated data, and to two published examples of small radioecological data sets: (I) counts of fungal taxa in samples of soil contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear power plan accident (Ukraine), and (II) bacterial abundance in soil samples under a ruptured nuclear waste storage tank (USA). We show that the proposed techniques were advantageous compared with the methodology used in the original publications where the data sets were presented. Specifically, our approach identified a negative effect of radioactive contamination in data set I, and suggested that in data set II stable chromium could have been a stronger limiting factor for bacterial abundance than the radionuclides 137Cs and 99Tc. This new information, which was extracted from these data sets using the proposed techniques, can potentially enhance the design of radioactive waste bioremediation. © 2017 Igor Shuryak This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"cesium 137; technetium 99m; pollutant; soil pollutant; Article; bacterium; Chernobyl accident; ecology; fungus; learning algorithm; machine learning; noise; population abundance; radioactive contamination; random forest; sensitivity analysis; simulation; software; algorithm; classification; microbiology; pollutant; radiation monitoring; radiation response; soil pollutant; theoretical model; Ukraine; Algorithms; Bacteria; Fungi; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Radiation Monitoring; Radioactive Pollutants; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009088561

In TLM, parallelepipeds are used to discretize three-dimensional problems. The drawback in using parallelepiped shapes is that instead of refining only the domain of interest, a large additional domain would also have to be refined, which results in increased computational time and memory space. In this paper, we developed a tetrahedral node for TLM applied to bio-heat transfer that does not have the drawback associated with the parallelepiped node.

The first method aims at identifying cell assemblies, groups of synchronously activating neurons possibly representing the units of neural coding and memory. A graphical (Ising) model distribution of snapshots of the neural activities, with an effective connectivity matrix reproducing the correlation statistics, is inferred from multi-electrode recordings, and then simulated in the presence of a virtual external drive, favoring high activity (multi-neuron) configurations. As the drive increases groups of neurons may activate together, and reveal the existence of cell assemblies. The identified groups are then showed to strongly coactivate in the neural spiking data and to be highly specific of the inferred connectivity network, which offers a sparse representation of the correlation pattern across neural cells. The second method relies on the inference of a Generalized Linear Model, in which spiking events are integrated over time by neurons through an effective connectivity matrix. The functional connectivity matrices inferred with the two approaches are compared. Sampling of the inferred GLM distribution allows us to study the spatio-temporal patterns of activation of neurons within the identified cell assemblies, particularly their activation order: the prevalence of one order with respect to the others is weak and reflects the neuron average firing rates and the strength of the largest effective connections. Other properties of the identified cell assemblies (spatial distribution of coactivation events and firing rates of coactivating neurons) are discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cell assemblies; Generalized linear model; Ising model; Replay; Statistical inference","Article; Bernoulli Generalized Linear model; brain function; controlled study; firing rate; functional connectivity; Ising model; Markov chain; memory consolidation; Monte Carlo method; nerve cell excitability; noise; oscillation; Poisson distribution; prefrontal cortex; probability; slow wave sleep; spike wave; statistical model; systematic error; action potential; animal; biological model; cytology; nerve cell; nerve cell network; physiology; prefrontal cortex; rat; sleep; time factor; wakefulness; Action Potentials; Animals; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Prefrontal Cortex; Rats; Sleep; Time Factors; Wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979987783

It has been argued that some cases where CFC is mathematically present may not reflect an interaction of two distinct yet functionally coupled neural sources with different frequencies. Here we provide two empirical examples from intracranial recordings where CFC can be shown to be driven by the shape of a periodic waveform rather than by a functional interaction between distinct sources. Using simulations, we also present a generalized and realistic scenario where such coupling may arise. This scenario, which we term waveform-dependent CFC, arises when sharp waveforms (e.g., cortical potentials) occur throughout parts of the data, in particular if they occur rhythmically. Since the waveforms contain both low- and high-frequency components, these components can be inherently phase-aligned as long as the waveforms are spaced with appropriate intervals. We submit that such behavior of the data, which seems to be present in various cortical signals, cannot be interpreted as reflecting functional modulation between distinct neural sources without additional evidence. In addition, we show that even low amplitude periodic potentials that cannot be readily observed or controlled for, are sufficient for significant CFC to occur. © 2016 Gerber et al.

When the data samples belong to different classes (e.g. disease status), the relationships may exhibit class-specific patterns that can be used to facilitate the understanding of a disease. Conventional approaches often perform separate analysis on each class and report the differences, but ignore important shared patterns. Results: In this paper, we develop a multivariate method to analyze the differential dependency across multiple classes. We propose a joint sparse canonical correlation analysis method, which uses a generalized fused lasso penalty to jointly estimate multiple pairs of canonical vectors with both shared and class-specific patterns. Using a data fusion approach, the method is able to detect differentially correlated modules effectively and efficiently. The results from simulation studies demonstrate its higher accuracy in discovering both common and differential canonical correlations compared to conventional sparse CCA.

Design of closed-loop anesthetic delivery (CLAD) systems is an important topic, particularly for medically induced coma, which needs to be maintained for long periods. Current CLADs for medically induced coma require a separate offline experiment for model parameter estimation, which causes interruption in treatment and is difficult to perform. Also, CLADs may exhibit bias due to inherent time-variation and non-stationarity, and may have large infusion rate variations at steady state. Finally, current CLADs lack theoretical performance guarantees. We develop the first adaptive CLAD for medically induced coma, which addresses these limitations. Further, we extend our adaptive system to be generalizable to other states of anesthesia. Approach. We designed general parametric pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and neural observation models with associated guidelines, and derived a novel adaptive controller. We further penalized large steady-state drug infusion rate variations in the controller. We derived theoretical guarantees that the adaptive system has zero steady-state bias. Using simulations that resembled real time-varying and noisy environments, we tested the closed-loop system for control of two different anesthetic states, burst suppression in medically induced coma and unconsciousness in general anesthesia. Main results. In 1200 simulations, the adaptive system achieved precise control of both anesthetic states despite non-stationarity, time-variation, noise, and no initial parameter knowledge. In both cases, the adaptive system performed close to a baseline system that knew the parameters exactly. In contrast, a non-adaptive system resulted in large steady-state bias and error. The adaptive system also resulted in significantly smaller steady-state infusion rate variations compared to prior systems. Significance. These results have significant implications for clinically viable CLAD design for a wide range of anesthetic states, with potential cost-saving and therapeutic benefits. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptive control; anesthesia; Bayesian estimation; closed-loop anesthetic delivery (CLAD); electroencephalogram (EEG); medically induced coma","Adaptive systems; Anesthesiology; Anesthetics; Bayesian networks; Closed loop control systems; Closed loop systems; Controllers; Drug infusion; Electroencephalography; Adaptive Control; anesthesia; Bayesian estimations; Closed loops; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); medically induced coma; Adaptive control systems; anesthetic agent; anesthetic agent; anesthesia; Article; closed loop anesthetic delivery; coma; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug infusion; electroencephalography; general anesthesia; infusion rate; noise; pharmacodynamics; practice guideline; priority journal; simulation; steady state; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; chemically induced; closed circuit anesthesia; coma; computer simulation; human; intravenous drug administration; Markov chain; procedures; Algorithms; Anesthesia, Closed-Circuit; Anesthesia, General; Anesthetics; Bayes Theorem; Coma; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Models, Biological; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002496945

We investigated the neural correlates of workload buildup in a fine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been known to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high performance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash - these failures are termed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and pupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within a virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT can be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma spectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma band activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest contribution, while theta band activity with a fronto-central topography has the most robust contribution in terms of real-world usability. We show that the output of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We also find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the magnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the decoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the dysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC) - anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to similar control failures in other cases of tight man-machine coupling where gains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for by the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological decoding of workload buildup that targets the LC-ACC circuit may positively impact operator performance in such situations. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","boundary avoidance task; EEG; flight; motor control; pilot induced oscillations; pupillometry; rapid decision making","Air navigation; Aircraft accidents; Couplings; Crashworthiness; Decision making; Decoding; Electroencephalography; Flight control systems; Human computer interaction; Neurons; Virtual reality; boundary avoidance task; flight; Motor control; Pilot-induced oscillations; Pupillometry; Fighter aircraft; adult; aircraft; alpha rhythm; anterior cingulate; arousal; Article; beta rhythm; boundary avoidance task; classification algorithm; decision making; delta rhythm; electroencephalography; electromyography; error; female; Fourier transformation; fronto central topography; gamma rhythm; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; latent period; lateralized somatosensory topography; locus ceruleus; male; measurement accuracy; mental load; mydriasis; neuropsychological test; normal human; oscillation; pilot induced oscillation; priority journal; pupil; pupillometry; sensory system examination; theta rhythm; virtual reality; visuomotor coordination; workload; aircraft; airplane pilot; algorithm; aviation; cingulate gyrus; man machine interaction; nerve cell network; physiology; psychomotor performance; pupil reflex; somatosensory cortex; virtual reality; young adult; Adult; Aircraft; Algorithms; Aviation; Decision Making; Electroencephalography; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Locus Coeruleus; Male; Man-Machine Systems; Nerve Net; Pilots; Psychomotor Performance; Reflex, Pupillary; Somatosensory Cortex; Virtual Reality; Workload; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002131836

The P300 speller is a popular brain-computer interface (BCI) system that has been investigated as a potential communication alternative for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. To achieve acceptable accuracy levels for communication, the system requires repeated data measurements in a given signal condition to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of elicited brain responses. These elicited brain responses, which are used as control signals, are embedded in noisy electroencephalography (EEG) data. The discriminability between target and non-target EEG responses defines a user's performance with the system. A previous P300 speller model has been proposed to estimate system accuracy given a certain amount of data collection. However, the approach was limited to a static stopping algorithm, i.e. averaging over a fixed number of measurements, and the row-column paradigm. A generalized method that is also applicable to dynamic stopping (DS) algorithms and other stimulus paradigms is desirable. Approach. We developed a new probabilistic model-based approach to predicting BCI performance, where performance functions can be derived analytically or via Monte Carlo methods. Within this framework, we introduce a new model for the P300 speller with the Bayesian DS algorithm, by simplifying a multi-hypothesis to a binary hypothesis problem using the likelihood ratio test. Under a normality assumption, the performance functions for the Bayesian algorithm can be parameterized with the detectability index, a measure which quantifies the discriminability between target and non-target EEG responses. Main results. Simulations with synthetic and empirical data provided initial verification of the proposed method of estimating performance with Bayesian DS using the detectability index. Analysis of results from previous online studies validated the proposed method. Significance. The proposed method could serve as a useful tool to initially assess BCI performance without extensive online testing, in order to estimate the amount of data required to achieve a desired accuracy level. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","BCI performance prediction; brain-computer interface; detectability index; dynamic stopping; likelihood ratio; P300 speller","Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Forecasting; Interfaces (computer); Monte Carlo methods; Signal to noise ratio; Statistical tests; Detectability index; Likelihood ratio tests; Likelihood ratios; P300 speller; Performance functions; Performance prediction; Probabilistic modeling; Target and non targets; Brain computer interface; accuracy; analytic method; Article; Bayesian learning; brain computer interface; dynamic stopping algorithm; electroencephalogram; learning algorithm; likelihood ratio test; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; simulation; statistical model; statistical parameters; theoretical model; algorithm; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Bayes theorem; communication aid; electroencephalography; event related potential; human; physiology; psychology; reproducibility; theoretical model; Algorithms; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Bayes Theorem; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Communication Aids for Disabled; Electroencephalography; Event-Related Potentials, P300; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002246060

Existing models of transmembrane action potential (AP) are complex (resulting in over parameterization) and varied (leading to dissimilar predictions). Thus, simpler models are needed to elucidate the “minimal physiological requirements” to reproduce significant observable phenomena using as few parameters as possible. Moreover, models have been derived from experimental studies from a variety of species under a range of environmental conditions (for example, all existing rabbit AP models incorporate a formulation of the rapid sodium current, INa, based on 30 year old data from chick embryo cell aggregates). Here we develop a simple “parsimonious” rabbit AP model that is mathematically identifiable (i.e., not over parameterized) by combining a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of INa with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current (IK). The model was calibrated using the following experimental data sets measured from the same species (rabbit) under physiological conditions: dynamic current-voltage (I-V) relationships during the AP upstroke; rapid recovery of AP excitability during the relative refractory period; and steady-state INa inactivation via voltage clamp. Simulations reproduced several important “emergent” phenomena including cellular alternans at rates &gt; 250 bpm as observed in rabbit myocytes, reentrant spiral waves as observed on the surface of the rabbit heart, and spiral wave breakup. Model variants were studied which elucidated the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave break up, namely the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK.The simplicity of the model, and the fact that its parameters have physiological meaning, make it ideal for engendering generalizable mechanistic insight and should provide a solid “building-block” to generate more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology. © 2016 Public Library of Science.

By incorporating a ""pencil beam"" 2D pulse into a T2-Prep, one may create a ""2D-T2-Prep"" that combines T2-weighting with an intrinsic outer volume suppression. This may particularly benefit parallel imaging techniques, where artefacts typically originate from residual foldover signal. By suppressing foldover signal with a 2D-T2-Prep, image quality may therefore improve. We present numerical simulations, phantom and in vivo validations to address this hypothesis. Methods: A 2D-T2-Prep and a conventional T2-Prep were used with GRAPPA-accelerated MRI (R = 1.6). The techniques were first compared in numerical phantoms, where per pixel maps of SNR (SNRmulti), noise, and g-factor were predicted for idealized sequences. Physical phantoms, with compartments doped to mimic blood, myocardium, fat, and coronary vasculature, were scanned with both T2-Preparation techniques to determine the actual SNRmulti and vessel sharpness. For in vivo experiments, the right coronary artery (RCA) was imaged in 10 healthy adults, using accelerations of R = 1,3, and 6, and vessel sharpness was measured for each. Results: In both simulations and phantom experiments, the 2D-T2-Prep improved SNR relative to the conventional T2-Prep, by an amount that depended on both the acceleration factor and the degree of outer volume suppression. For in vivo images of the RCA, vessel sharpness improved most at higher acceleration factors, demonstrating that the 2D-T2-Prep especially benefits accelerated coronary MRA. Conclusion: Suppressing outer volume signal with a 2D-T2-Prep improves image quality particularly well in GRAPPA-accelerated acquisitions in simulations, phantoms, and volunteers, demonstrating that it should be considered when performing accelerated coronary MRA. © 2016 Coristine et al.

The efficient coding hypothesis, a guiding principle in computational neuroscience, suggests that a neuron or population of neurons allocates its limited range of responses as efficiently as possible to best encode inputs while mitigating the effects of noise. Previous work on this question relies on specific assumptions about where noise enters a circuit, limiting the generality of the resulting conclusions. Here we systematically investigate how noise introduced at different stages of neural processing impacts optimal coding strategies. Using simulations and a flexible analytical approach, we show how these strategies depend on the strength of each noise source, revealing under what conditions the different noise sources have competing or complementary effects. We draw two primary conclusions: (1) differences in encoding strategies between sensory systems—or even adaptational changes in encoding properties within a given system—may be produced by changes in the structure or location of neural noise, and (2) characterization of both circuit nonlinearities as well as noise are necessary to evaluate whether a circuit is performing efficiently. © 2016 Brinkman et al.",,"nervous system; noise; nonlinear system; animal; biological model; computer simulation; human; information retrieval; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; sensory nerve cell; signal noise ratio; statistical model; synaptic transmission; Animals; Computer Simulation; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net; Sensory Receptor Cells; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994172656

Various repetitive elements in human and other higher eukaryotic genomes contribute in large part to ambiguously (non-uniquely) mapped reads. Most available NGS aligners attempt to address this by either removing all non-uniquely mapping reads, or reporting one random or ""best"" hit based on simple heuristics. Accurate estimation of the mapping quality of NGS reads is therefore critical albeit completely lacking at present. Here we developed a generalized software toolkit ""AlignerBoost"", which utilizes a Bayesian-based framework to accurately estimate mapping quality of ambiguously mapped NGS reads. We tested AlignerBoost with both simulated and real DNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets at various thresholds. In most cases, but especially for reads falling within repetitive regions, AlignerBoost dramatically increases the mapping precision of modern NGS aligners without significantly compromising the sensitivity even without mapping quality filters. When using higher mapping quality cutoffs, AlignerBoost achieves a much lower false mapping rate while exhibiting comparable or higher sensitivity compared to the aligner default modes, therefore significantly boosting the detection power of NGS aligners even using extreme thresholds. AlignerBoost is also SNP-aware, and higher quality alignments can be achieved if provided with known SNPs. AlignerBoost’s algorithm is computationally efficient, and can process one million alignments within 30 seconds on a typical desktop computer.

Early exposure to STEM-related concepts is critical to later academic achievement. Given the rise of tablet-computer use in early childhood education settings, interactive technology might be one particularly fruitful way of supplementing early STEM education. Using a between-subjects experimental design, we sought to determine whether preschoolers could learn a fundamental math concept (i.e., measurement with non-standard units) from educational technology, and whether interactivity is a crucial component of learning from that technology. Participants who either played an interactive tablet-based game or viewed a non-interactive video demonstrated greater transfer of knowledge than those assigned to a control condition. Interestingly, interactivity contributed to better performance on near transfer tasks, while participants in the non-interactive condition performed better on far transfer tasks.

However, its application in measurement of ATP synthesis rate in vivo has lagged behind the more common saturation transfer (ST) techniques. One well-recognized issue with IT is the complexity of data analysis in comparison with much simpler analysis by ST. This complexity arises, in part, because the γ-ATP spin is involved in multiple chemical reactions and magnetization exchanges, whereas Pi is involved in a single reaction, Pi → γ-ATP. By considering the reactions involving γ-ATP only as a lumped constant, the rate constant for the reaction of physiological interest, kPi→γATP, can be determined. Here, we present a new IT data analysis method to evaluate kPi→γATP using data collected from resting human skeletal muscle at 7 T. The method is based on the basic Bloch–McConnell equation, which relates kPi→γATP to (Formula presented.), the rate of Pi magnetization change. The kPi→γATP value is accessed from (Formula presented.) data by more familiar linear correlation approaches. For a group of human subjects (n = 15), the kPi→γATP value derived for resting calf muscle was 0.066 ± 0.017 s−1, in agreement with literature-reported values. In this study we also explored possible time-saving strategies to speed up data acquisition for kPi→γATP evaluation using simulations. The analysis indicates that it is feasible to carry out a 31P IT experiment in about 10 min or less at 7 T with reasonable outcome in kPi→γATP variance for measurement of ATP synthesis in resting human skeletal muscle. We believe that this new IT data analysis approach will facilitate the wide acceptance of IT to evaluate ATP synthesis rate in vivo. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

The numerical simulations of these episodes are important for monitoring grain yield and estimating agricultural water demand. However, uncertainties still remain despite that enormous experiments and modeling studies have been conducted concerning this issue, due to either inaccurate synoptic situation derived from mesoscale weather models or unrealistic parameterizations of stomatal physiology in land surface models. Hereby, we investigated the synoptic characteristics of DHW with widely-used mesoscale model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the effects of leaf physiology on surface evapotranspiration by comparing two land surface models: The Noah land surface model, and Peking University Land Model (PKULM) with stomata processes included. Results show that the WRF model could well replicate the synoptic situations of DHW. Two types of DHW were identified: (1) prevailing heated dry wind stream forces the formation of DHW along with intense sensible heating and (2) dry adiabatic processes overflowing mountains. Under both situations, the PKULM can reasonably model the stomatal closure phenomena, which significantly decreases both evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange of canopy, while these phenomena cannot be resolved in the Noah simulations. Therefore, our findings suggest that the WRF-PKULM coupled method may be a more reliable tool to investigate and forecast DHW as well as be instructive to crop models. Copyright 2016 Wang et al.

Given the vast opportunities enabled by large Electronic Health Records (EHR) data and powerful resources for conducting predictive modeling, we argue that it is yet crucial to first carefully examine the prediction task and then choose predictive methods accordingly. Specifically, we argue that there are at least three distinct prediction tasks that are often conflated in biomedical research: 1) data imputation, where a model fills in the missing values in a dataset, 2) future forecasting, where a model projects the development of a medical condition for a known patient based on existing observations, and 3) newpatient generalization, where a model transfers the knowledge learned from previously observed patients to newly encountered ones. Importantly, the latter two tasks-future forecasting and new-patient generalizations-tend to be more difficult than data imputation as they require predictions to be made on potentially out-of-sample data (i.e., data following a different predictable pattern from what has been learned by the model). Using hearing loss progression as an example, we investigate three regression models and show that the modeling of latent clusters is a robust method for addressing the more challenging prediction scenarios. Overall, our findings suggest that there exist significant differences between various kinds of prediction tasks and that it is important to evaluate the merits of a predictive model relative to the specific purpose of a prediction task. © 2016 Qian, Masino.

A ubiquitous example from neuroscience is low frequency phase to high frequency amplitude coupling in electrophysiological signals. Seminal work by Canolty revealed CFC in human ECoG data. Established methods band-pass the data into component frequencies then convert the band-passed signals into the analytic representation, from which we infer the instantaneous amplitude and phase of each component. Though powerful, such methods resolve signals with respect to time and frequency without addressing the multiresolution problem. New method: We build upon the ground-breaking work of Canolty and others and derive a wavelet-based CFC detection algorithm that efficiently searches a range of frequencies using a sequence of filters with optimal trade-off between time and frequency resolution. We validate our method using simulated data and analyze CFC within and between the primary motor cortex and dorsal striatum of rats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. Results: Our method detects the correct CFC in simulated data and reveals CFC between frequency bands that were previously shown to participate in corticostriatal effective connectivity. Comparison with existing methods: Other CFC detection methods address the need to increase bandwidth when analyzing high frequency components but none to date permit rigorous bandwidth selection with no a priori knowledge of underlying CFC. Our method is thus particularly useful for exploratory studies. Conclusions: The method developed here permits rigorous and efficient exploration of a hypothesis space and is particularly useful when the frequencies participating in CFC are unknown. © 2016 .","Anesthesia; Cross-frequency coupling; Generalized Morse wavelets; In vivo electrophysiology; Signal processing","ketamine; xylazine; anesthetic agent; hypnotic sedative agent; ketamine; xylazine; algorithm; analytic method; anesthesia; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; cross frequency coupling detection method; dorsal striatum; male; nonhuman; primary motor cortex; priority journal; rat; simulation; wavelet analysis; algorithm; animal; computer simulation; corpus striatum; motor cortex; nerve tract; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; validation study; Algorithms; Anesthesia; Anesthetics, Dissociative; Animals; Computer Simulation; Corpus Striatum; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Ketamine; Male; Motor Cortex; Neural Pathways; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Wavelet Analysis; Xylazine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969856785

Building on an atomic-level structural model of a low-light-adapted chromatophore vesicle from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, we investigate the cooperation between more than a hundred protein complexes in the vesicle. The steady-state ATP production rate as a function of incident light intensity is determined after identifying quinol turnover at the cytochrome bc1 complex (cytbc1) as rate limiting and assuming that the quinone/quinol pool of about 900 molecules acts in a quasi-stationary state. For an illumination condition equivalent to 1% of full sunlight, the vesicle exhibits an ATP production rate of 82. ATP molecules/s. The energy conversion efficiency of ATP synthesis at illuminations corresponding to 1%–5% of full sunlight is calculated to be 0.12–0.04, respectively. The vesicle stoichiometry, evolutionarily adapted to the low light intensities in the habitat of purple bacteria, is suboptimal for steady-state ATP turnover for the benefit of protection against over-illumination. © Sener et al.",,"adenosine triphosphate; membrane protein; proton; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; quinone derivative; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; hydroquinone derivative; quinone derivative; Article; atomic force microscopy; bacterial chromatophore; controlled study; energy conversion; energy transfer; enzyme metabolism; illumination; kinetics; light absorption; light adaptation; light harvesting system; light intensity; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; photochemical efficiency; photosynthesis; protein domain; quantum yield; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; simulation; spectroscopy; stoichiometry; sunlight; bacterial chromatophore; biosynthesis; energy metabolism; light; metabolism; radiation response; Adenosine Triphosphate; Bacterial Chromatophores; Energy Metabolism; Hydroquinones; Light; Quinones; Rhodobacter sphaeroides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985986954

This study aimed to compare knowledge and skill acquisition for a basic neurologic examination between OB nurses who participated in simulation and those who participated in an online self-study module. Short- and long-term knowledge retention and skill transfer between groups were evaluated. Methods Nurses were randomized to either simulation or online self-study module and assessed by direct observation and completion of a standardized instrument by the observer at 3 time points: baseline (time 1), within 7 days of baseline in the clinical setting (time 2), and at 2 months (time 3) using a validated12-item Neurologic Knowledge Assessment and a 14-item performance skill checklist. Results Among OB nurses, those in the simulation group demonstrated higher levels in both short-term (time 2) [mean (SD), 67.6 (20.2) vs. 29.6 (19.0); P < 0.001] and long-term (time 3) [mean (SD), 46.1 (17.6) vs. 27.5 (15.9); P < 0.001] skill performance compared with nurses in the online self-study module. Nurses in the simulation and online self-study module groups had similar mean levels on Neurologic Knowledge Assessment scores at time 2 (P = 0.86) and time 3 (P = 0.59), but these mean scores were not significant. Conclusions The greater transfer of skills by nurses who received simulation education is an important finding because few studies have addressed this level of translation with practicing nurses. There was a lack of differences in short- and long-term knowledge acquisition between nurses in the simulation and online self-study module groups. More research is needed to determine the timing of simulation-based education repetition over time to aid in knowledge and skills retention. © 2016 Society for Simulation in Healthcare.","Clinical nurses; In-situ simulation; Randomized controlled trial; Retention; Transfer of learning","adult; checklist; clinical competence; clinical trial; controlled study; education; human; long term memory; middle aged; multicenter study; obstetrical nursing; randomized controlled trial; simulation training; single blind procedure; Adult; Checklist; Clinical Competence; Humans; Middle Aged; Obstetric Nursing; Retention (Psychology); Simulation Training; Single-Blind Method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978154103

This study was designed to evaluate technical skill performance of SIL versus LAP surgery in a simulated environment. Methods: We developed a modified laparoscopic skills trainer for SIL based upon the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) model. This includes a standard laparoscopic tower for visualization, allowing replication of the conflicts between scope and instruments. It also has a modified trainer box allowing use of different access devices and instruments for SIL. Sixteen subjects at different levels of training (novice through expert) completed four FLS tasks with standard LAP techniques. They then practiced the same tasks using SIL technique until they reached a steady state of performance. The first and last SIL trials were recorded. Results: Baseline SIL peg transfer was worse than FLS (254 ± 157 s vs 99 ± 27, p < 0.0002). Final SIL time was still significantly worse than FLS (173 ± 130, p < 0.02). FLS, baseline SIL, and final SIL circle cutting were not significantly different (p = 0.058). Final SIL loop ligation was significantly faster than FLS (48 ± 19 vs 70 ± 42, p < 0.05). FLS suturing was faster than SIL suturing (281 ± 188 vs. 526 ± 105, p < 0.01). There was substantial dropout due to frustration with SIL, and only two surgeons were able to successfully complete SIL suturing. Conclusions: There are technical challenges with SIL that vary depending on task. Peg transfer and suturing were significantly impaired in SIL, while circle cutting was not significantly affected, and ligating loop was faster with SIL than LAP. These challenges may impact clinical outcomes of SIL and should influence training in SIL as well as future product development. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Laparoscopy; Simulation; Single-incision laparoscopy; Surgical education","Article; clinical article; frustration; fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscope; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopic video camera; laparoscopy; motor performance; priority journal; single incision laparoscopy; skill; steady state; surgical training; task performance; adult; clinical competence; education; evaluation study; female; laparoscopy; ligation; male; medical education; procedures; standards; surgeon; suture; task performance; Adult; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Ligation; Male; Surgeons; Sutures; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955592245

Tool A had three adjustable handle angle configurations, i.e., in-line 0° (A0), 30° (A30), and pistol-grip 70° (A70). Tool B was a fixed pistol-grip grasper. Participants performed FLS peg transfer, inverted peg transfer, and inverted circle cut with each tool and handle angle. Inverted tasks were adapted from standard FLS tasks to simulate advanced tasks observed during abdominal wall surgeries, e.g., ventral hernia. Motion tracking, video analysis, and modified NASA-TLX workload questionnaires were used to measure postures, performance (e.g., completion time and errors), and workload. Results: Task performance did not differ between tools. For FLS peg transfer, self-reported physical workload was lower for B than for A70, and mean wrist postures showed significantly higher flexion for in-line than for pistol-grip tools (B and A70). For inverted peg transfer, workload was higher for all configurations. However, less time was spent in at-risk wrist postures for in-line (47 %) than for pistol-grip (93–94 %), and most participants preferred Tool A. For inverted circle cut, workload did not vary across configurations, mean wrist posture was 10° closer to neutral for A0 than B, and median time in at-risk wrist postures was significantly less for A0 (43 %) than for B (87 %). Conclusion: The best ergonomic wrist positions for FLS (floor) tasks are provided by pistol-grip tools and for tasks on the abdominal wall (ventral surface) by in-line handles. Adjustable handle angle laparoscopic tools can reduce ergonomic risks of musculoskeletal strain and allow versatility for tasks alternating between the floor and ceiling positions in a surgical trainer without impacting performance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ergonomics; FLS tasks; Handle angles; Laparoscopic tools; NASA-TLX; Wrist postures","abdominal surgery; abdominal wall hernia; arm movement; Article; body posture; comparative study; controlled study; ergonomics; female; human; laparoscope; laparoscopic monitor; laparoscopic retractor; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopic surgical instrument; male; priority journal; range of motion; self report; shift handle laparoscopic tool; task performance; videorecording; workload; wrist; bioengineering; equipment design; laparoscope; movement (physiology); physiology; wrist; Equipment Design; Human Engineering; Humans; Laparoscopes; Movement; Task Performance and Analysis; Wrist",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946431164

In this study we propose a noise-Tolerant homolog knowledge transfer method to reconstruct functional protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks between Epstein-Barr virus and Homo sapiens. The training set is augmented via homolog instances and the homolog noise is counteracted by support vector machine (SVM). Additionally we propose two methods to define subcellular co-localization (i.e. stringent and relaxed), based on which to further derive physical PPI networks. Computational results show that the proposed method achieves sound performance of cross validation and independent test. In the space of 648,672 EBV-human protein pairs, we obtain 51,485 functional interactions (7.94%), 869 stringent physical PPIs and 46,050 relaxed physical PPIs. Fifty-eight evidences are found from the latest database and recent literature to validate the model. This study reveals that Epstein-Barr virus interferes with normal human cell life, such as cholesterol homeostasis, blood coagulation, EGFR binding, p53 binding, Notch signaling, Hedgehog signaling, etc. The proteome-wide predictions are provided in the supplementary file for further biomedical research.",,"computer simulation; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; genetics; human; metabolism; nucleic acid database; signal transduction; Computer Simulation; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Humans; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979901306

Individual-gene-ranking methods ignore interactions between genes. Furthermore, popular pair-wise gene evaluation methods, e.g. TSP and TSG, are helpless for discovering pair-wise interactions. Several efforts to discover pair-wise synergy have been made based on the information approach, such as EMBP and FeatKNN. However, the methods which are employed to estimate mutual information, e.g. binarization, histogram-based and KNN estimators, depend on known data or domain characteristics. Recently, Reshef et al. proposed a novel maximal information coefficient (MIC) measure to capture a wide range of associations between two variables that has the property of generality. An extension from MIC(X; Y) to MIC(X 1; X 2; Y) is therefore desired. We developed an approximation algorithm for estimating MIC(X 1; X 2; Y) where Y is a discrete variable. MIC(X 1; X 2; Y) is employed to detect pair-wise synergy in simulation and cancer microarray data. The results indicate that MIC(X 1; X 2; Y) also has the property of generality. It can discover synergic genes that are undetectable by reference feature selection methods such as MIC(X; Y) and TSG. Synergic genes can distinguish different phenotypes. Finally, the biological relevance of these synergic genes is validated with GO annotation and OUgene database.",,"biostatistics; genetic association study; human; microarray analysis; neoplasm; pathology; procedures; Biostatistics; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Microarray Analysis; Neoplasms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979924806

The underlying mechanisms shape the endogenous chromatin landscape and determine its response to ectopically targeted histone modifiers. Here, we simulate linear and loopingdriven spreading of histone modifications and compare bothmodels to recent experiments on histone methylation in fission yeast. We find that a generalized nucleation-and-looping mechanism describes key observations on engineered and endogenous methylation domains including intrinsic spatial confinement, independent regulation of domain size and memory, variegation in the absence of antagonists, and coexistence of short- and long-term memory at loci with weak and strong constitutive nucleation. These findings support a straightforward relationship between the biochemical properties of chromatin modifiers and the spatiotemporal modification pattern. The proposed mechanism gives rise to a phase diagram for cellular memory that may be generally applicable to explain epigenetic phenomena across different species.","Epigenetic memory; Epigenome editing; Heterochromatin; Histone modification; Stochastic simulation","histone; histone; Conference Paper; epigenetics; histone methylation; histone modification; nonhuman; nucleosome; priority journal; Schizosaccharomyces; simulation; biological model; epigenetics; metabolism; methylation; protein domain; Epigenomics; Histones; Methylation; Models, Biological; Protein Domains; Schizosaccharomyces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978901223

RelA/SpoT-homolog proteins synthesize transcriptional modulators (p)ppGpp, allowing bacteria to adapt to stress. RelA is activated during amino-acid starvation, when cognate deacyl-tRNA binds to the ribosomal A (aminoacyl-tRNA) site. We report four cryo-EM structures of E. coli RelA bound to the 70S ribosome, in the absence and presence of deacyl-tRNA accommodating in the 30S A site. The boomerang-shaped RelA with a wingspan of more than 100 Å wraps around the A/R (30S A-site/RelA-bound) tRNA. The CCA end of the A/R tRNA pins the central TGS domain against the 30S subunit, presenting the (p)ppGpp-synthetase domain near the 30S spur. The ribosome and A/R tRNA are captured in three conformations, revealing hitherto elusive states of tRNA engagement with the ribosomal decoding center.

We investigated head movement as an objective tool for assessment of laparoscopic surgical skill and its potential use for assessing novice surgeons' progress on the learning curve. Design After obtaining institutional review board approval, medical students, urology residents, and attending staff surgeons from an academic institution were recruited. Participants were grouped by level of experience and performed tasks on the Electronic Data Generation for Evaluation laparoscopic simulator. Surgeons wore a commercially available wireless electroencephalogram monitor as a flexible, adjustable, and lightweight headband with 7 sensors - 2 forehead sensors, 2 ear sensors, and 3 reference sensors. The headband incorporates a 3-axis accelerometer enabling head movement quantification. A variance analysis was used to compare the average head movement acceleration data between each group. Setting Tulane University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, an academic medical center and the principal teaching hospital for Tulane University School of Medicine. Participants A total of following 19 participants were recruited for the study and stratified by surgical experience into novice (n = 6), intermediate (n = 9), and expert (n = 4) laparoscopy groups: 6 medical students, 9 urology residents (postgraduate years 1 to5), and 4 attending urologists, respectively. Results Analysis of the average acceleration rate of head movement showed statistically significant differences among groups on both the vertical axis (p = 0.006) and horizontal axis (p = 0.018) in the laparoscopic suturing task. This demonstrated the ability to distinguish between experts and novice laparoscopic surgeons. The average acceleration among groups did not demonstrate statistical significance on the vertical axis (p = 0.078) and horizontal axis (p = 0.077) in the peg transfer task. This may be in response to the ease of the task. The analysis of the forward-backward axis or depth perception also showed no significant differences between groups. Conclusion Accelerometer-based motion analysis of head movement appears to be a useful tool to evaluate laparoscopic skill development of surgeons in terms of their economy of motion, and it could potentially be used for ergonomic assessment of training in the future, and progression on the learning curve. © 2016 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

However, sufficient experimental and analytical results are available to evaluate this standard approach in the case of animal dominance hierarchies (pecking orders). Our evaluation using evidence from hierarchy formation in small groups of both hens and cichlid fish reveals significant deficiencies in the three tenets of the standard approach in accounting for the organization of dominance hierarchies. In consequence, we suggest that a new approach is needed to explain the organization of pecking orders and, very possibly, by implication, for other kinds of social hierarchies. We develop an example of such an approach that considers dominance hierarchies to be dynamic networks, uses dynamic sequences of interaction (dynamic network motifs) to explain the organization of dominance hierarchies, and derives these dynamic sequences directly from observation of hierarchy formation. We test this dynamical explanation using computer simulation and find a good fit with actual dynamics of hierarchy formation in small groups of hens. We hypothesize that the same dynamic sequences are used in small groups of many other animal species forming pecking orders, and we discuss the data required to evaluate our hypothesis. Finally, we briefly consider how our dynamic approach may be generalized to other kinds of social hierarchies using the example of the distribution of empty gastropod (snail) shells occupied in populations of hermit crabs. © 2016 Chase, Lindquist.

In adiabatic quantum computing, a system is slowly evolved from the ground state of a simple initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian that encodes a computational problem. The appeal of this approach lies in the combination of simplicity and generality; in principle, any problem can be encoded. In practice, applications are restricted by limited connectivity, available interactions and noise. A complementary approach is digital quantum computing, which enables the construction of arbitrary interactions and is compatible with error correction, but uses quantum circuit algorithms that are problem-specific. Here we combine the advantages of both approaches by implementing digitized adiabatic quantum computing in a superconducting system. We tomographically probe the system during the digitized evolution and explore the scaling of errors with system size. We then let the full system find the solution to random instances of the one-dimensional Ising problem as well as problem Hamiltonians that involve more complex interactions. This digital quantum simulation of the adiabatic algorithm consists of up to nine qubits and up to 1,000 quantum logic gates.

Objective To screen medical students (MS), residents and fellows for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) under the new era of work hour reform with age-matched controls from a large representative cross-sectional survey. Methods We conducted an anonymous online survey at a medical university in 2013-2014. We incorporated the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) to screen for MDD and the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) to screen for GAD, along with additional questions on life stressors and academic performance. We compared these results to age-matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Results126 residents/fellows and 336 medical students participated voluntarily. 15.1% and 15.9% of postgraduates as well as 16.4% and 20.3% of MS screened positive for MDD and GAD, respectively. When compared to national estimates, the prevalence of a positive screen for MDD was over five-fold higher in medical trainees compared to age-matched controls (16% vs. 2.8%, p<0.0001). Similarly, the prevalence of a positive screen for GAD was over eightfold higher in medical trainees (19% vs. 2.3%, p<0.0001).The prevalence was consistently higher within age strata. 33.3% of postgraduates and 32% of MS believe there is a significant impact of depression or anxiety on their academic performance. For stress relief, one fifth of residents/fellows as well as MS reported alcohol use. Conclusions The stresses of medical education and practice may predispose trainees to psychopathological consequences that can affect their academic performance and patient care. The current study showed a significantly higher rate of MDD and GAD positive screens in medical trainees than the prevalence in an age-matched U.S. population, despite significant work hour reform for medical trainees. Increased awareness and support services are required at all levels of medical training. We propose that the ACGME and the Institute of Medicine may consider these findings when implementing future changes to work hour regulations. © 2016 Mousa et al.",,"academic achievement; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; job stress; major clinical study; major depression; male; mass screening; medical student; postgraduate student; resident; sensitivity and specificity; young adult; adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; case control study; depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; education; medical education; medical student; middle aged; prevalence; psychology; questionnaire; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Socioeconomic Factors; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Training Support; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975760128

This transformation is governed by the spike threshold, which depends on the history of the membrane potential on many temporal scales. While the adaptation of the threshold after spiking activity has been addressed before both theoretically and experimentally, it has only recently been demonstrated that the subthreshold membrane state also influences the effective spike threshold. The consequences for neural computation are not well understood yet. We address this question here using neural simulations and whole cell intracellular recordings in combination with information theoretic analysis. We show that an adaptive spike threshold leads to better stimulus discrimination for tight input correlations than would be achieved otherwise, independent from whether the stimulus is encoded in the rate or pattern of action potentials. The time scales of input selectivity are jointly governed by membrane and threshold dynamics. Encoding information using adaptive thresholds further ensures robust information transmission across cortical states i.e. decoding from different states is less state dependent in the adaptive threshold case, if the decoding is performed in reference to the timing of the population response. Results from in vitro neural recordings were consistent with simulations from adaptive threshold neurons. In summary, the adaptive spike threshold reduces information loss during intracellular information transfer, improves stimulus discriminability and ensures robust decoding across membrane states in a regime of highly correlated inputs, similar to those seen in sensory nuclei during the encoding of sensory information. © 2016 Huang et al.",,"action potential; in vitro study; intracellular recording; membrane; nerve cell; spike; stimulus; theoretical model; whole cell; animal; biological model; biology; female; male; mouse; patch clamp technique; physiology; Action Potentials; Animals; Computational Biology; Female; Male; Mice; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Patch-Clamp Techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978785858

Joint analysis of simultaneously collected spike and LFP signals is an important step to explicate how the brain orchestrates information processing. In this contribution, we present a novel statistical framework based on Gaussian copula to jointly model spikes and LFP. In our approach, we use copula to link separate, marginal regression models to construct a joint regression model, in which the binary-valued spike train data are modeled using generalized linear model (GLM) and the continuous-valued LFP data are modeled using linear regression. Model parameters can be efficiently estimated via maximum-likelihood. In particular, we show that our model offers a means to statistically detect directional influence between spikes and LFP, akin to Granger causality measure, and that we are able to assess its statistical significance by conducting a Wald test. Through extensive simulations, we also show that our method is able to reliably recover the true model used to generate the data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real setting, we further apply the method to a mixed neural dataset, consisting of spikes and LFP simultaneously recorded from the visual cortex of a monkey performing a contour detection task. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Copula; Generalized linear model; Local field potentials; Neural data analysis; Spike trains","animal experiment; Article; controlled study; electric potential; firing rate; Haplorhini; kernel method; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mental task; nerve cell network; nonhuman; priority journal; process model; spike; spike wave; stimulus response; visual cortex; visual stimulation; action potential; algorithm; biological model; brain mapping; computer simulation; electroencephalography; evoked response; human; physiology; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962407689

Quantifying metabolic demand is an essential step for revealing the many mechanisms of physical performance decrement, but accurate predictive models do not exist. The goal of this study was to investigate if a recently developed model of muscle energetics and force could be extended to reproduce the kinematics, kinetics, and metabolic demand of submaximal effort movement. Upright dynamic knee extension against various levels of ergometer load was simulated. Task energetics were estimated by combining the model of muscle contraction with validated models of lower limb musculotendon paths and segment dynamics. A genetic algorithm was used to compute the muscle excitations that reproduced the movement with the lowest energetic cost, which was determined to be an appropriate criterion for this task. Model predictions of oxygen uptake rate (VO2) were well within experimental variability for the range over which the model parameters were confidently known. The model's accurate estimates of metabolic demand make it useful for assessing the likelihood and severity of physical performance decrement for a given task as well as investigating underlying physiologic mechanisms. © 2016 Tsianos, MacFadden.",,"oxygen; Article; controlled study; energy consumption; energy transfer; ergometer; human; human experiment; kinematics; kinetics; knee; lower limb; male; muscle contraction; muscle excitation; muscle function; muscle strength; normal human; oxygen consumption; physical performance; prediction; validation study; algorithm; biological model; biology; biomechanics; computer simulation; energy metabolism; movement (physiology); physiology; skeletal muscle; Algorithms; Biomechanical Phenomena; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Knee Joint; Models, Biological; Movement; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978795443

This is to be distinguished from the method of surrogate data, used in time series. The purpose of a surrogate is to reduce the time necessary for a computation at the cost of rigor and generality. We describe a method of constructing surrogates in the form of support vector machine (SVM) regressions for the purpose of exploring the parameter space of physiological models. Our focus is on the methodology of surrogate creation and accuracy assessment in comparison to the original model. This is done in the context of a simulation of hemorrhage in one model, ""Small"", and renal denervation in another, HumMod. In both cases, the surrogate predicts the drop in mean arterial pressure following the intervention. We asked three questions concerning surrogate models: (1) how many training examples are necessary to obtain an accurate surrogate, (2) is surrogate accuracy homogeneous, and (3) how much can computation time be reduced when using a surrogate. We found the minimum training set size that would guarantee maximal accuracy was widely variable, but could be algorithmically generated. The average error for the pressure response to the protocols was -0.05±2.47 in Small, and -0.3 +/- 3.94 mmHg in HumMod. In the Small model, error grew with actual pressure drop, and in HumMod, larger pressure drops were overestimated by the surrogates. Surrogate use resulted in a 6 order of magnitude decrease in computation time. These results suggest surrogate modeling is a valuable tool for generating predictions of an integrative model's behavior on densely sampled subsets of its parameter space. © 2016 Pruett, Hester.

In this paper, we present a generalized space- and time-dependent mathematical model of drug transport and drug-cell interactions to quantitatively formulate this hypothesis. Model parameters describe: perfusion and tissue architecture (blood volume fraction and blood vessel radius); diffusion penetration distance of drug (i.e., a function of tissue compactness and drug uptake rates by tumor cells); and cell death rates (as function of history of drug uptake). We performed preliminary testing and validation of the mathematical model using in vivo experiments with different drug delivery methods on a breast cancer mouse model. Experimental data demonstrated a 3-fold increase in response using nano-vectored drug vs. free drug delivery, in excellent quantitative agreement with the model predictions. Our model results implicate that therapeutically targeting blood volume fraction, e.g., through vascular normalization, would achieve a better outcome due to enhanced drug delivery. Author Summary: Cancer treatment efficacy can be significantly enhanced through the elution of drug from nano-carriers that can temporarily stay in the tumor vasculature. Here we present a relatively simple yet powerful mathematical model that accounts for both spatial and temporal heterogeneities of drug dosing to help explain, examine, and prove this concept. We find that the delivery of systemic chemotherapy through a certain form of nano-carriers would have enhanced tumor kill by a factor of 2 to 4 over the standard therapy that the patients actually received. We also find that targeting blood volume fraction (a parameter of the model) through vascular normalization can achieve more effective drug delivery and tumor kill. More importantly, this model only requires a limited number of parameters which can all be readily assessed from standard clinical diagnostic measurements (e.g., histopathology and CT). This addresses an important challenge in current translational research and justifies further development of the model towards clinical translation. © 2016 Wang et al.",,"doxorubicin; nanocarrier; antineoplastic agent; drug carrier; nanoparticle; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blood vessel diameter; blood volume; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cell death; controlled study; drug penetration; drug transport; drug uptake; female; in vivo study; mathematical model; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; animal; Bagg albino mouse; biological model; biology; computer simulation; Neoplasms; spatiotemporal analysis; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Drug Carriers; Female; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Models, Biological; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Spatio-Temporal Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978839871

One potential mechanism for reorganization is for an ssDNA translocase (ATP-dependent motor) to push the SSB along ssDNA. Here we use single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to detect such pushing events. When Cy5-labeled Escherichia coli (Ec) SSB is bound to surface-immobilized 3′-Cy3-labeled ssDNA, a fluctuating FRET signal is observed, consistent with random diffusion of SSB along the ssDNA. Addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1, a 5′ to 3′ ssDNA translocase, results in the appearance of isolated, irregularly spaced saw-tooth FRET spikes only in the presence of ATP. These FRET spikes result from translocase-induced directional (5′ to 3′) pushing of the SSB toward the 3′ ssDNA end, followed by displacement of the SSB from the DNA end. Similar ATP-dependent pushing events, but in the opposite (3′ to 5′) direction, are observed with EcRep and EcUvrD (both 3′ to 5′ ssDNA translocases). Simulations indicate that these events reflect active pushing by the translocase. The ability of translocases to chemo-mechanically push heterologous SSB proteins along ssDNA provides a potential mechanism for reorganization and clearance of tightly bound SSBs from ssDNA.","DNA motors; Dynamics; SF1 translocases; SSB proteins","carrier protein; Pif1 protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; single stranded DNA; single stranded DNA binding protein; unclassified drug; adenosine triphosphate; carbocyanine; cyanine dye 3; cyanine dye 5; DNA binding protein; Escherichia coli protein; protein binding; single stranded DNA; Article; DNA recombination; DNA repair; DNA replication; Escherichia coli; fluorescence microscopy; motor activity; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; chemistry; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; kinetics; metabolism; spectrofluorometry; Adenosine Triphosphate; Carbocyanines; DNA Replication; DNA, Single-Stranded; DNA-Binding Proteins; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Kinetics; Protein Binding; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973115869

How do IDR sequences modulate the functionalities of motifs? We answer this question using the polyampholytic C-terminal IDR of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27Kip1 (p27). Phosphorylation of Thr-187 (T187) within the p27 IDR controls entry into S phase of the cell division cycle. Additionally, the conformational properties of polyampholytic sequences are predicted to be influenced by the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues. Therefore, we designed sequence variants of the p27 IDR to alter charge patterning outside the primary substrate motif containing T187. Computer simulations and biophysical measurements confirm predictions regarding the impact of charge patterning on the global dimensions of IDRs. Through functional studies, we uncover cryptic sequence features within the p27 IDR that influence the efficiency of T187 phosphorylation. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between T187 phosphorylation efficiency and the weighted net charge per residue of an auxiliary motif. We also find that accumulation of positive charges within the auxiliary motif can diminish the efficiency of T187 phosphorylation because this increases the likelihood of long-range intra-IDR interactions that involve both the primary and auxiliary motifs and inhibit their contributions to function. Importantly, our findings suggest that the cryptic sequence features of the WT p27 IDR negatively regulate T187 phosphorylation signaling. Our approaches provide a generalizable strategy for uncovering the influence of sequence contexts on the functionalities of primary motifs in other IDRs.","Disordered regions; Motif; P27","cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; intrinsically disordered protein; CDKN1B protein, human; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; amino acid sequence; Article; cell cycle regulation; cell cycle S phase; cell division; computer simulation; correlational study; priority journal; protein motif; protein phosphorylation; cell cycle; chemistry; human; phosphorylation; physiology; protein conformation; signal transduction; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Cell Cycle; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27; Humans; Phosphorylation; Protein Conformation; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969847975

Experimental evidence suggests that the fusion is preceded by considerable elastic softening of the cell membranes due to the insertion of fusion peptide in the membrane. What are the mechanisms underpinning the elastic softening of the membrane upon peptide insertion? A broader question may be posed: insertion of rigid proteins in soft membranes ought to stiffen the membranes not soften them. However, experimental observations perplexingly appear to show that rigid proteins may either soften or harden membranes even though conventional wisdom only suggests stiffening. In this work, we argue that regarding proteins as merely non-specific rigid inclusions is flawed, and each protein has a unique mechanical signature dictated by its specific interfacial coupling to the surrounding membrane. Predicated on this hypothesis, we have carried out atomistic simulations to investigate peptide-membrane interactions. Together with a continuum model, we reconcile contrasting experimental data in the literature including the case of HIV-fusion peptide induced softening. We conclude that the structural rearrangements of the lipids around the inclusions cause the softening or stiffening of the biological membranes.",,"Human immunodeficiency virus protein; cell membrane; chemical phenomena; chemistry; computer simulation; Human immunodeficiency virus; metabolism; physiology; virology; virus entry; Cell Membrane; Chemical Phenomena; Computer Simulation; HIV; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins; Virus Internalization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966378437

Studies in experimental systems have demonstrated that such interactions are common among beneficial mutations and often follow a pattern consistent with declining evolvability of more fit genotypes. However, these studies generally examine the consequences of interactions between a small number of focal mutations. It is not clear, therefore, that findings can be extrapolated to natural populations, where new mutations may be transferred between genetically divergent backgrounds. We build on work that examined interactions between four beneficial mutations selected in a laboratory-evolved population of Escherichia coli to test how they interact with the genomes of diverse natural isolates of the same species. We find that the fitness effect of transferred mutations depends weakly on the genetic and ecological similarity of recipient strains relative to the donor strain in which the mutations were selected. By contrast, mutation effects were strongly inversely correlated to the initial fitness of the recipient strain. That is, there was a pattern of diminishing returns whereby fit strains benefited proportionally less from an added mutation. Our results strengthen the view that the fitness of a strain can be a major determinant of its ability to adapt. They also support a role for barriers of transmission, rather than differential selection of transferred DNA, as an explanation of observed phylogenetically determined patterns of restricted recombination among E. coli strains.","Beneficial mutations; Epistasis; Horizontal gene transfer; Mutation-by-genetic background interactions","amino acid sequence; Article; epistasis; Escherichia coli; fitness effect; gene interaction; gene mutation; genetic background; genetic distance; genetic parameters; genotype; horizontal gene transfer; natural population; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; recipient; transferred mutation; biological model; classification; computer simulation; ecosystem; genetic selection; genetics; genotype environment interaction; mutation; procedures; reproductive fitness; risk assessment; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Epistasis, Genetic; Escherichia coli; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Fitness; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Risk Assessment; Selection, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965154573

A non-invasive estimation of bone strain requires combined musculoskeletal - finite element modeling, for which the applied muscle forces are usually obtained from static optimization (SO) methods. In this study, we compared finite element predicted femoral strains in walking using muscle forces obtained from SO to those obtained from forward dynamics (FD) simulation. The general trends in strain distributions were similar between FD and SO derived conditions and both agreed well with previously reported in vivo strain gage measurements. On the other hand, differences in peak maximum (εmax) and minimum (εmin) principal strain magnitudes were as high as 32% between FD (εmax/εmin=945/-1271 με) and SO (εmax/εmin=752/-859 με). These large differences in strain magnitudes were observed during the first half of stance, where SO predicted lower gluteal muscle forces and virtually no co-contraction of the hip adductors compared to FD. The importance of these results will likely depend on the purpose/application of the modeling procedure. If the goal is to obtain a generalized strain distribution for adaptive bone remodeling algorithms, then traditional SO is likely sufficient. In cases were strain magnitudes are critical, as is the case with fracture risk assessment, bone strain estimation may benefit by including muscle activation and contractile dynamics in SO, or by using FD when practical. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomechanics; Bone; Finite element model; Mechanical loading; Musculoskeletal model","Biomechanics; Bone; Finite difference method; Finite element method; Fracture; Health risks; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Strain gages; Fracture risk assessments; Mechanical loading; Musculoskeletal model; Preventive measures; Static and dynamic optimization; Static optimization; Strain distributions; Strain gage measurements; Strain; adduction; Article; bone stress; femur; gluteus maximus muscle; greater trochanter; muscle strength; prediction; priority journal; shear stress; simulation; standing; stress strain relationship; surface property; walking; biological model; computer simulation; female; femur; finite element analysis; human; mechanical stress; muscle contraction; physiology; skeletal muscle; very elderly; walking; Aged, 80 and over; Computer Simulation; Female; Femur; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Stress, Mechanical; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977950753

A multi-shot, interleaved 3D radial sampling function was designed by segmenting a single-shot trajectory of projection views such that each interleaf samples k-space in an incoherent fashion. An optimal segmentation factor for the interleaved acquisition was derived based on an approximate model of respiratory patterns such that radial interleaves are evenly accepted during the retrospective gating. The optimality of the proposed sampling scheme was tested by numerical simulations and phantom experiments using human respiratory waveforms. Retrospectively, respiratory-gated, free-breathing lung MRI with the proposed sampling strategy was performed in healthy subjects. The simulation yielded the most uniform k-space sample density with the optimal segmentation factor, as evidenced by the smallest standard deviation of the number of neighboring samples as well as minimal side-lobe energy in the point spread function. The optimality of the proposed scheme was also confirmed by minimal image artifacts in phantom images. Human lung images showed that the proposed sampling scheme significantly reduced streak and ring artifacts compared with the conventional retrospective respiratory gating while suppressing motion-related blurring compared with full sampling without respiratory gating. In conclusion, the proposed 3D radial-sampling scheme can effectively suppress the image artifacts due to non-uniform k-space sample density in retrospectively respiratory-gated lung MRI by uniformly distributing gated radial views across the k-space. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D radial UTE imaging; k-space sample uniformity; Lung MRI; Retrospective respiratory gating","Biological organs; Optical transfer function; Reconfigurable hardware; Respiratory mechanics; K space; Lung mris; Optimal segmentation; Respiratory gatings; Respiratory pattern; Sampling strategies; Standard deviation; Ultrashort echo time; Magnetic resonance imaging; Article; breathing; human; imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; respiratory gated imaging; retrospective study; three dimensional ultrashort echo time lung imaging; waveform; algorithm; anatomy and histology; computer simulation; imaging phantom; lung; mathematical computing; procedures; three dimensional imaging; time factor; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lung; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Phantoms, Imaging; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976217087

Both the resolution of these redundancies and the energetics of such systems depend on the dynamic properties of muscles and tendons, particularly their force-length relations. Current walking models that use stock parameters when simulating muscle-tendon dynamics tend to significantly overestimate metabolic consumption, perhaps because they do not adequately consider the role of elasticity. As an alternative, we posit that the muscle-tendon morphology of the human leg has evolved to maximize the metabolic efficiency of walking at self-selected speed. We use a data-driven approach to evaluate this hypothesis, utilizing kinematic, kinetic, electromyographic (EMG), and metabolic data taken from five participants walking at self-selected speed. The kinematic and kinetic data are used to estimate muscle-tendon lengths, muscle moment arms, and joint moments while the EMG data are used to estimate muscle activations. For each subject we perform an optimization using prescribed skeletal kinematics, varying the parameters that govern the force-length curve of each tendon as well as the strength and optimal fiber length of each muscle while seeking to simultaneously minimize metabolic cost and maximize agreement with the estimated joint moments. We find that the metabolic cost of transport (MCOT) values of our participants may be correctly matched (on average 0.36±0.02 predicted, 0.35±0.02 measured) with acceptable joint torque fidelity through application of a single constraint to the muscle metabolic budget. The associated optimal muscle-tendon parameter sets allow us to estimate the forces and states of individual muscles, resolving redundancies in joint actuation and lending insight into the potential roles and control objectives of the muscles of the leg throughout the gait cycle. © 2016 Markowitz, Herr.",,"adult; Article; controlled study; electromyography; energy transfer; human; human experiment; kinematics; kinetics; male; metabolic cost of transport; metabolism; muscle contraction; muscle length; muscle strength; normal human; tendon; torque; walking; walking speed; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; biology; biomechanics; computer simulation; energy metabolism; gait; leg; physiology; skeletal muscle; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Biomechanical Phenomena; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Energy Metabolism; Gait; Humans; Leg; Male; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Tendons; Torque; Walking; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975813308

Key to CRL activity is the recruitment of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 through electrostatic interactions between E3?s cullin conserved basic canyon and the acidic C terminus of the E2 enzyme. This report demonstrates that a smallmolecule compound, suramin, can inhibit CRL activity by disrupting its ability to recruit Cdc34. Suramin, an antitrypansomal drug that also possesses antitumor activity, was identified here through a fluorescence-based high-throughput screen as an inhibitor of ubiquitination. Suramin was shown to target cullin 1's conserved basic canyon and to block its binding to Cdc34. Suramin inhibits the activity of a variety of CRL complexes containing cullin 2, 3, and 4A. When introduced into cells, suramin induced accumulation of CRL substrates.

However, current decoders do not model the spikes directly, and hence may limit the processing time-scale of BMI control and adaptation. Moreover, while specialized CLDA techniques for intention estimation and assisted training exist, a unified and systematic CLDA framework that generalizes across different setups is lacking. Here we develop a novel closed-loop BMI training architecture that allows for processing, control, and adaptation using spike events, enables robust control and extends to various tasks. Moreover, we develop a unified control-theoretic CLDA framework within which intention estimation, assisted training, and adaptation are performed. The architecture incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control (OFC) model of the brain’s behavior in closed-loop BMI control, and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user’s motor intention during CLDA—a process termed intention estimation. OFC is also used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders; it also enables dynamic spike-event-based parameter adaptation unlike current CLDA methods that use batch-based adaptation on much slower adaptation time-scales. We conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to dissociate the effects of these novel CLDA components. The OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared with current intention estimation techniques. OFC assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control.

Previous incidents from Sverdlosk and the postal anthrax attack of 2001 have raised questions on the mechanism of spread of Bacillus anthracis spores as an aerosol or contaminant. Prior studies have demonstrated that Bacillus atrophaeus is easily transferred through simulated mail handing, but no reports have demonstrated this ability with Bacillus anthracis spores, which have morphological differences that may affect adhesion properties between spore and formite. In this study, equipment developed to simulate interactions across three generations of envelopes subjected to tumbling and mixing was used to evaluate the potential for cross-contamination of B. anthracis spores in simulated mail handling. In these experiments, we found that the potential for cross-contamination through letter tumbling from one generation to the next varied between generations while the presence of a fluidizer had no statistical impact on the transfer of material. Likewise, the presence or absence of a fluidizer had no statistically significant impact on cross-contamination levels or reaerosolization from letter opening. © 2016, Public Library of Science.

For complex tasks, however, where both the potential benefits and costs of coordinated work increase with the number of workers, neither theoretical arguments nor empirical evidence consistently favor larger vs. smaller teams. Experimental findings, meanwhile, have relied on small groups and highly stylized tasks, hence are hard to generalize to realistic settings. Here we narrow the gap between real-world task complexity and experimental control, reporting results from an online experiment in which 47 teams of size ranging from n = 1 to 32 collaborated on a realistic crisis mapping task. We find that individuals in teams exerted lower overall effort than independent workers, in part by allocating their effort to less demanding (and less productive) sub-tasks; however, we also find that individuals in teams collaborated more with increasing team size. Directly comparing these competing effects, we find that the largest teams outperformed an equivalent number of independent workers, suggesting that gains to collaboration dominated losses to effort. Importantly, these teams also performed comparably to a field deployment of crisis mappers, suggesting that experiments of the type described here can help solve practical problems as well as advancing the science of collective intelligence. © 2016 Mao et al.

Statistical methods leveraging the tissue-specificity of DNA methylation for deconvoluting the cellular mixture of heterogenous biospecimens offer a promising solution, however the performance of such methods depends entirely on the library of methylation markers being used for deconvolution. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm for Identifying Optimal Libraries (IDOL) that dynamically scans a candidate set of cell-specific methylation markers to find libraries that optimize the accuracy of cell fraction estimates obtained from cell mixture deconvolution. Results: Application of IDOL to training set consisting of samples with both whole-blood DNA methylation data (Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadArray (HM450)) and flow cytometry measurements of cell composition revealed an optimized library comprised of 300 CpG sites. When compared existing libraries, the library identified by IDOL demonstrated significantly better overall discrimination of the entire immune cell landscape (p = 0.038), and resulted in improved discrimination of 14 out of the 15 pairs of leukocyte subtypes. Estimates of cell composition across the samples in the training set using the IDOL library were highly correlated with their respective flow cytometry measurements, with all cell-specific R 2&gt;0.99 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from [0.97 % to 1.33 %] across leukocyte subtypes. Independent validation of the optimized IDOL library using two additional HM450 data sets showed similarly strong prediction performance, with all cell-specific R 2&gt;0.90 and R M S E&lt;4.00 %. In simulation studies, adjustments for cell composition using the IDOL library resulted in uniformly lower false positive rates compared to competing libraries, while also demonstrating an improved capacity to explain epigenome-wide variation in DNA methylation within two large publicly available HM450 data sets. Conclusions: Despite consisting of half as many CpGs compared to existing libraries for whole blood mixture deconvolution, the optimized IDOL library identified herein resulted in outstanding prediction performance across all considered data sets and demonstrated potential to improve the operating characteristics of EWAS involving adjustments for cell distribution. In addition to providing the EWAS community with an optimized library for whole blood mixture deconvolution, our work establishes a systematic and generalizable framework for the assembly of libraries that improve the accuracy of cell mixture deconvolution. © 2016 Koestler et al.","Cell heterogeneity; Cell mixture estimation; DNA methylation; EWAS","Algorithms; Alkylation; Bioinformatics; Blood; Cytology; DNA; Flow cytometry; Libraries; Mean square error; Methylation; Mixtures; Cell mixtures; DNA Methylation; EWAS; False positive rates; Operating characteristics; Prediction performance; Root mean square errors; Tissue specificity; Cells; cell composition; cell fractionation; cellular distribution; DNA methylation; DNA structure; epigenetics; error; flow cytometry; genetic polymorphism; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; landscape; library; prediction; validation process; adult; algorithm; CpG island; cytology; gene library; genetics; human genome; leukocyte; metabolism; Adult; Algorithms; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Flow Cytometry; Gene Library; Genome, Human; Humans; Leukocytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960082583

However, traditional surgical simulators are used to train surgeons in a skills laboratory that does not recreate these conditions. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a novel, immersive virtual reality (Gen2-VR©) system to train surgeons in these environments. This study was to establish face and construct validity of our system. Methods and procedures: The study was a within-subjects design, with subjects repeating a virtual peg transfer task under three different conditions: Case I: traditional VR; Case II: Gen2-VR© with no distractions and Case III: Gen2-VR© with distractions and interruptions. In Case III, to simulate the effects of distractions and interruptions, music was played intermittently, the camera lens was fogged for 10 s and tools malfunctioned for 15 s at random points in time during the simulation. At the completion of the study subjects filled in a 5-point Likert scale feedback questionnaire. A total of sixteen subjects participated in this study. Results: Friedman test showed significant difference in scores between the three conditions (p &lt; 0.0001). Post hoc analysis using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction further showed that all the three conditions were significantly different from each other (Case I, Case II, p &lt; 0.0001), (Case I, Case III, p &lt; 0.0001) and (Case II, Case III, p = 0.009). Subjects rated that fog (mean 4.18) and tool malfunction (median 4.56) significantly hindered their performance. Conclusion: The results showed that Gen2-VR© simulator has both face and construct validity and that it can accurately and realistically present distractions and interruptions in a simulated OR, in spite of limitations of the current HMD hardware technology. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cognitive simulator; Face and construct validation; Gen2-VR©; Head-mounted display; Immersive virtual reality; Surgery simulator","accuracy; Article; Bonferroni correction; camera; computer program; construct validity; face validity; female; Friedman test; human; human experiment; Likert scale; male; monitor; music; operating room; post hoc analysis; priority journal; simulator; statistical model; surgeon; surgery simulator; surgical training; virtual reality; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; attention; computer interface; education; feedback system; laparoscopy; procedures; simulation training; validation study; Attention; Feedback; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Simulation Training; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959176014

To overcome this severe limitation, a fully automated, inexpensive system has been developed, which allows accurate and efficient Pavlovian associative learning/memory analyses for high-throughput pharmacological and genetic studies. New method: The automated system employs a linear actuator coupled to an odorant T-maze with airflow-mediated transfer of animals between training and testing stages. Odorant, airflow and electrical shock delivery are automatically administered and monitored during training trials. Control software allows operator-input variables to define parameters of Drosophila learning, short-term memory and long-term memory assays. Results: The approach allows accurate learning/memory determinations with operational fail-safes. Automated learning indices (immediately post-training) and memory indices (after 24. h) are comparable to traditional manual experiments, while minimizing experimenter involvement. Comparison with existing methods: The automated system provides vast improvements over labor-intensive manual approaches with no experimenter involvement required during either training or testing phases. It provides quality control tracking of airflow rates, odorant delivery and electrical shock treatments, and an expanded platform for high-throughput studies of combinational drug tests and genetic screens. The design uses inexpensive hardware and software for a total cost of ~$500US, making it affordable to a wide range of investigators. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the design, construction and testing of a fully automated Drosophila olfactory classical association apparatus to provide low-labor, high-fidelity, quality-monitored, high-throughput and inexpensive learning and memory behavioral assays. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Automation; Drosophila; Learning; Memory; Olfactory; Pavlovian classical conditioning","airflow; animal experiment; Article; automation; computer interface; computer program; conditioning; controlled study; cost control; Drosophila; electric shock; intermethod comparison; learning; long term memory; memory assessment; nonhuman; priority journal; sensor; short term memory; smelling; T-maze test; animal; automated pattern recognition; comparative study; conditioned reflex; economics; equipment design; laboratory automation; learning; long term memory; physical stimulation; procedures; psychologic test; short term memory; software; fragrance; Animals; Association Learning; Automation, Laboratory; Conditioning, Classical; Drosophila; Electroshock; Equipment Design; Memory, Long-Term; Memory, Short-Term; Odorants; Olfactory Perception; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Physical Stimulation; Psychological Tests; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952705236

Expression of CT and CTR is frequently elevated in prostate cancers (PCs) and activation of CT-CTR axis in noninvasive PC cells induces an invasive phenotype. Here we show by yeast-Two hybrid screens that CTR associates with the tight junction protein Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) via the interaction between the type 1 PDZ motif at the carboxy-Terminus of CTR and the PDZ3 domain of ZO-1. Mutation of either the CTR C-PDZ-binding motif or the ZO-1-PDZ3 domain did not affect binding of CTR with its ligand or G-protein-mediated signaling but abrogated destabilizing actions of CT on tight junctions and formation of distant metastases by orthotopically implanted PC cells in nude mice, indicating that these PDZ domain interactions were pathologically relevant. Further, we observed CTR-ZO-1 interactions in PC specimens by proximity ligation immunohistochemistry, and identified that the number of interactions in metastatic PC specimens was several-fold larger than in non-metastatic PC. Our results for the first time demonstrate a mechanism by which PDZ-mediated interaction between CTR and ZO1 is required for CT-stimulated metastasis of prostate cancer. Since many receptors contain PDZ-binding motifs, this would suggest that PDZ-binding motif-Adaptor protein interactions constitute a common mechanism for cancer metastasis. © 2016 Aljameeli et al.

The point spread function (PSF) of linogram sampling was analyzed for image sharpness and artifacts. Generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisition was implemented for this new sampling scheme, and images were reconstructed with high acceleration rates. The results were compared with conventional radial sampling methods using simulations and phantom experiments at 3T. Additionally, a human volunteer was scanned at 7T. The results demonstrated that the PSF was sharper and the mean artifact power was lower for linogram sampling compared with radial sampling. Results of simulations and phantom experiments were in accord with the findings of the PSF analysis. In simulations, errors in the reconstructed images were lower for linogram sampling. In phantom experiments, fine details and sharp edges were preserved for linogram sampling, while details were blurred for radial sampling. The in vivo human study demonstrated that linogram sampling could provide high quality images of anatomy, even at high acceleration rates. Linogram sampling not only possesses the advantages of radial sampling, such as reduced sensitivity to motion and higher acceleration rates, but it also provides sharper images with fewer artifacts. Moreover, it is less prone to off-resonance artifacts compared with radial sampling. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Linogram; Non-Cartesian; Parallel imaging; Radial imaging","Image processing; Optical transfer function; Generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions; High quality images; Linogram; Non-Cartesian; Parallel imaging; Parallel imaging method; Reconstructed image; Reduced sensitivity; Image reconstruction; Article; human; image quality; in vivo study; linogram; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; radiological procedures; algorithm; artifact; computer simulation; imaging phantom; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; signal noise ratio; Algorithms; Artifacts; Computer Simulation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Signal-To-Noise Ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961285871

For FRET microscopy to reach its full potential, it must be able to image more than one pair of interacting molecules and image degradation from out-of-focus light must be reduced. Here we extend our previous work on the application of maximum likelihood methods to the 3-dimensional reconstruction of 3-way FRET interactions within cells. We validated the new method (3D-3Way FRET) by simulation and fluorescent protein test constructs expressed in cells. In addition, we improved the computational methods to create a 2-log reduction in computation time over our previous method (3DFSR). We applied 3D-3Way FRET to image the 3D subcellular distributions of HIV Gag assembly. Gag fused to three different FPs (CFP, YFP, and RFP), assembled into viral-like particles and created punctate FRET signals that become visible on the cell surface when 3D-3Way FRET was applied to the data. Control experiments in which YFP-Gag, RFP-Gag and free CFP were expressed, demonstrated localized FRET between YFP and RFP at sites of viral assembly that were not associated with CFP. 3D-3Way FRET provides the first approach for quantifying multiple FRET interactions while improving the 3D resolution of FRET microscopy data without introducing bias into the reconstructed estimates. This method should allow improvement of widefield, confocal and superresolution FRET microscopy data. © 2016 Scott, Hoppe.

In these situations, it may be more appropriate to give novices learning goals to help avoid these negative consequences. The purpose of this study was to see whether this tenant of goal theory applied to novices learning 2 tasks of fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS). Materials and Methods Medical and physician assistant students were randomized to a performance goals group and a learning goals group. The performance goals consisted of the published proficiency standards of FLS. Both groups were pretested on perception of surgery, self-efficacy, and general affect. Each group underwent a practice session for the peg transfer task. They were tested and scored per the published standards of FLS. The participants completed NASA Task Load Index, task complexity, and postaffect questionnaires related to the peg transfer task. This was repeated with the suture with intracorporeal knot task. Posttest perception of surgery and self-efficacy questionnaires were completed. Results In total, 48 students participated in the study: 23 in the performance goals group and 25 in the learning goals group. Most of the participants (n = 40) were first-year medical and physician assistant students. There were no significant differences between the groups in perception of surgery, affect, goal commitment, subjective task complexity, subjective workload, and self-efficacy. There were no differences between the groups concerning overall FLS score for both the peg transfer and suturing tasks. Both groups exhibited significant increases in self-efficacy and perception of surgery (p < 0.05). Conclusion FLS skills can be given to novice learners without concern for detrimental effects as might be expected by other work on goal theory. Given that performance was the same for both groups, surgical educators may have multiple pathways to educational success when incorporating goals into training programs for basic surgical skills. © 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","educational goals; simulation; surgical education","affect; Article; controlled study; exploratory research; human; laparoscopic surgery; learning; motivation; perception; performance; physician assistant student; priority journal; professional standard; questionnaire; self concept; surgical training; suturing method; task performance; theory; workload; adult; curriculum; education; female; laparoscopy; male; medical education; motivation; physician assistant; procedures; randomized controlled trial; suture technique; Adult; Competency-Based Education; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Goals; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Physician Assistants; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Suture Techniques; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958743477

Preterm birth can cause serious health problems in newborns, as well as large financial burdens to society. Various techniques such as electromyography (EMG) and magnetomyography (MMG) have been developed to quantify uterine contractions. However, no widely accepted method to predict labor based on electromagnetic measurement is available. Therefore, developing a biophysical model of EMG and MMG could help better understand uterine contractions, interpret real measurements, and detect labor. In this work, we propose a multiscale realistic model of uterine contractions during pregnancy. At the cellular level, building on bifurcation theory, we apply generalized FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations that produces both plateau-type and bursting-type action potentials. At the tissue level, we introduce a random fiber orientation model applicable to an arbitrary uterine shape. We also develop an analytical expression for the propagation speed of transmembrane potential. At the organ level, a realistic volume conductor geometry model is provided based on magnetic resonance images of a pregnant woman. To simulate the measurements from the SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) device, we propose a sensor array model. Our model is able to reproduce the characteristics of action potentials. Additionally, we investigate the sensitivity of MMG to model configuration aspects such as volume geometry, fiber orientation, and pacemaker location. Our numerical results show that fiber orientation and pacemaker location are the key aspects that greatly affect the MMG as measured by the SARA device. We conclude that sphere is appropriate as an approximation of the volume geometry. The initial step towards validating the model against real MMG measurement is also presented. Our results show that the model is flexible to mimic the limited-propagation magnetic signature during the emergence and decay of a uterine contraction. © 2016 Zhang et al.

A number of promising computational techniques have been developed to aid in repositioning, however, the majority of available methodologies require highly specific data inputs that preclude the use of many datasets and databases. There is a clear unmet need for a generalized methodology that enables the integration of multiple types of both gene expression data and database schema. Results: ksRepo eliminates the need for a single microarray platform as input and allows for the use of a variety of drug and chemical exposure databases. We tested ksRepo's performance on a set of five prostate cancer datasets using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) as our database of gene-compound interactions. ksRepo successfully predicted significance for five frontline prostate cancer therapies, representing a significant enrichment from over 7000 CTD compounds, and achieved specificity similar to other repositioning methods. Conclusions: We present ksRepo, which enables investigators to use any data inputs for computational drug repositioning. ksRepo is implemented in a series of four functions in the R statistical environment under a BSD3 license.

Adaptation may require the use of visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory environment and back, as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight, the prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our previous paper, we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however, larger overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects, in the absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback, are believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because, in the absence of relevant external dynamic cues such as optic flow, reliance on body-based cues is enhanced during gait tasks through multisensory integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of optic flow on tactile-stimulated split-belt adaptation as a paradigm to facilitate the sensorimotor adaptation process. Twenty healthy young adults, separated into two matched groups, participated in the study. All participants performed an overground walking trial followed by a split-belt treadmill adaptation protocol. The tactile group (TC) received vibratory plantar tactile stimulation only, whereas the virtual reality and tactile group (VRT) received an additional concurrent visual stimulation: a moving virtual corridor, inducing perceived self-motion. A post-treadmill overground trial was performed to determine adaptation transfer. Interlimb coordination of spatiotemporal and kinetic variables was quantified using symmetry indices and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Marked changes of step length characteristics were observed in both groups during split-belt adaptation. Stance and swing time symmetries were similar in the two groups, suggesting that temporal parameters are not modified by optic flow. However, whereas the TC group displayed significant stance time asymmetries during the post-treadmill session, such aftereffects were absent in the VRT group. The results indicated that the enhanced transfer resulting from exposure to plantar cutaneous vibration during adaptation was alleviated by optic flow information. The presence of visual self-motion information may have reduced proprioceptive gain during learning. Thus, during overground walking, the learned proprioceptive split-belt pattern is more rapidly overridden by visual input due to its increased relative gain. The results suggest that when visual stimulation is provided during adaptive training, the system acquires the novel movement dynamics while maintaining the ability to flexibly adapt to different environments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomechanics; Gait; Motor control; Motor learning; Sensory; Vibration; Virtual reality","adaptation; adult; Article; association; environmental factor; female; gait; human; human experiment; learning; locomotion; male; motor control; normal human; optic flow; priority journal; proprioception; sensorimotor integration; standing; tactile feedback; tactile stimulation; task performance; training; treadmill test; vibration sense; virtual reality; visual feedback; visual stimulation; visuomotor coordination; adaptation; exercise test; motor activity; optic flow; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; spatial behavior; time factor; touch; young adult; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Optic Flow; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Spatial Behavior; Time Factors; Touch; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955637735

Within PT, random practice of tasks has been shown to lead to improved skill retention and transfer. Methods General surgery residents were equally randomized to PT vs WT, mastery learning type, and simulation-based training of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Training time and resources used to reach mastery (skill acquisition), performance at 1-month testing (skill retention), and intraoperative time and performance scores (skill transfer) were compared. Results Forty-four general surgery trainees were randomized. All residents achieved mastery benchmarks. Trainees in the PT group achieved mastery on average 17 minutes faster (60.2 ± 23.8 vs 77.1 ± 24.8 minutes, P =.02, saving 6.2 instructor hours), used fewer material resources (curricular cost savings of $2,380 or $121 per learner), and were more likely to retain mastery level performance at 1-month retention testing (59% vs 22.7% P =.03). No differences in intraoperative performance were encountered.

Here we use a computational model to examine, predict, and explain these effects. We use a two-compartment Pinsky-Rinzel model neuron polarized by an electric potential difference imposed between its compartments, and we apply an injected ramp current. We vary three model parameters: the magnitude of the applied potential difference, the extracellular potassium concentration, and the rate of current injection. A study of the Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) as a function of polarization leads to the identification of three regions of polarization strength that have different effects. In the weak region, the TTFS increases linearly with polarization. In the intermediate region, the TTFS increases either sub- or super-linearly, depending on the current injection rate and the extracellular potassium concentration. In the strong region, the TTFS decreases. Our results in the weak and strong region are consistent with experimental observations, and in the intermediate region, we predict novel effects that depend on experimentally-accessible parameters. We find that active channels in the dendrite play a key role in these effects. Our qualitative results were found to be robust over a wide range of inter-compartment conductances and the ratio of somatic to dendritic membrane areas.

We sought to summarize evidence regarding the validity of scores from the FLS assessment. Methods: We systematically searched for studies evaluating the FLS as an assessment tool (last search update February 26, 2013). We classified validity evidence using the currently standard validity framework (content, response process, internal structure, relations with other variables, and consequences). Results: From a pool of 11,628 studies, we identified 23 studies reporting validity evidence for FLS scores. Studies involved residents (n = 19), practicing physicians (n = 17), and medical students (n = 8), in specialties of general (n = 17), gynecologic (n = 4), urologic (n = 1), and veterinary (n = 1) surgery. Evidence was most common in the form of relations with other variables (n = 22, most often expert–novice differences). Only three studies reported internal structure evidence (inter-rater or inter-station reliability), two studies reported content evidence (i.e., derivation of assessment elements), and three studies reported consequences evidence (definition of pass/fail thresholds). Evidence nearly always supported the validity of FLS total scores. However, the loop ligation task lacks discriminatory ability. Conclusion: Validity evidence confirms expected relations with other variables and acceptable inter-rater reliability, but other validity evidence is sparse. Given the high-stakes use of this assessment (required for board eligibility), we suggest that more validity evidence is required, especially to support its content (selection of tasks and scoring rubric) and the consequences (favorable and unfavorable impact) of assessment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Assessment; Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery; Simulation; Validation","Article; cholecystectomy; construct validity; human; laparoscopic surgery; priority journal; skill; surgical training; systematic review; test retest reliability; validity; work environment; clinical competence; education; laparoscopy; procedures; reproducibility; simulation training; United States; Clinical Competence; Humans; Laparoscopy; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957839290

With sufficiently large forcing of heat, the direction of fluid flow in the loop oscillates chaotically, dynamics analogous to the Earth's weather. As is the case for state-of-the-art weather models, we only observe the statistics over a small region of state space, making prediction difficult. To overcome this challenge, data assimilation (DA) methods, and specifically ensemble methods, use the computational model itself to estimate the uncertainty of the model to optimally combine these observations into an initial condition for predicting the future state. Here, we build and verify four distinct DA methods, and then, we perform a twin model experiment with the computational fluid dynamics simulation of the loop using the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) to assimilate observations and predict flow reversals. We show that using adaptively shaped localized covariance outperforms static localized covariance with the ETKF, and allows for the use of less observations in predicting flow reversals. We also show that a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) of the temperature and velocity fields recovers the low dimensional system underlying reversals, finding specific modes which together are predictive of reversal direction. © 2016 Reagan et al.

In principle, neural events that register stimulus-arrival-time differences at an early sensory stage could set the limit on SJs and TOJs alike. Alternatively, distinct limits on SJs and TOJs could arise from task-specific neural events occurring after the stimulus-driven stage. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a novel reaction-time (RT) measure and tested it in a perceptual-learning procedure. The stimuli comprised dual-stream Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) displays. Participants judged either the simultaneity or temporal order of red-letter and black-number targets presented in opposite lateral hemifield streams of black-letter dis-tractors. Despite identical visual stimulation across-tasks, the SJ and TOJ tasks generated distinct RT patterns. SJs exhibited significantly faster RTs to synchronized targets than to subtly asynchronized targets; TOJs exhibited the opposite RT pattern. These task-specific RT patterns cannot be attributed to the early, stimulus-driven stage and instead match what one would predict if the limits on SJs and TOJs arose from task-specific decision spaces. That is, synchronized targets generate strong evidence for simultaneity, which hastens SJ RTs. By contrast, synchronized targets provide no information about temporal order, which slows TOJ RTs. Subtly asynchronizing the targets reverses this information pattern, and the corresponding RT patterns. In addition to investigating RT patterns, we also investigated training-transfer between the tasks. Training to improve SJ precision failed to improve TOJ precision, and vice versa, despite identical visual stimulation across tasks. This, too, argues against early, stimulus-driven limits on SJs and TOJs. Taken together, the present study offers novel evidence that distinct rules set the limits on SJs and TOJs. ©2016 Matthews et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"decision making; human; learning; reaction time; visual stimulation; attention; computer simulation; decision making; hearing; normal human; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychometry; time perception; vision; Attention; Auditory Perception; Computer Simulation; Decision Making; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Judgment; Photic Stimulation; Psychometrics; Reaction Time; Time Perception; Vision, Ocular; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954414787

Using a simple mathematical model describing the individual interactions of the wasps, we explain the functioning of the common stomach, an information center, which governs construction behavior and task change. Our central hypothesis is a symmetry between foragers who deposit water and foragers who withdraw water into and out of the common stomach. We combine this with a trade-off between acceptance and resistance to water transfer. We ultimately derive a mathematical function that relates the number of interactions that foragers complete with common stomach wasps during a foraging cycle. We use field data and additional model assumptions to calculate values of our model parameters, and we use these to explain why the fullness of the common stomach stabilizes just below 50 percent, why the average number of successful interactions between foragers and the wasps forming the common stomach is between 5 and 7, and why there is a variation in this number of interactions over time. Our explanation is that our proposed water exchange mechanism places natural bounds on the number of successful interactions possible, water exchange is set to optimize mediation of water through the common stomach, and the chance that foragers abort their task prematurely is very low.

This notion of BTC is a function of image location and lesion shape and size. We propose four unsupervised BTC estimators based on: (i) perceived pre- and post-lesion similarity of images, (ii) lesion border analysis (LBA; conspicuous lesion should be brighter than its surround), (iii) tissue anomaly detection, and (iv) mammogram density measurement. The latter two are existing methods we adapt for location- and lesion-dependent BTC estimation. To validate the BTC estimators, we ask human observers to measure BTC as the visibility threshold amplitude of an inserted lesion at specified locations in a mammogram. Both human-measured and computationally estimated BTC varied with lesion shape (from circular to oval), size (from small circular to larger circular), and location (different points across a mammogram). BTCs measured by different human observers are correlated (ρ=0.67). BTC estimators are highly correlated to each other (0.84<rho;<0.95) and less so to human observers (ρ<=0.81). With change in lesion shape or size, estimated BTC by LBA changes in the same direction as human-measured BTC. A generalization of proposed methods for viewing breast tomosynthesis sequences in cine mode is outlined. The proposed estimators, as-is or customized to a specific human observer, may be used to construct a BTC-aware model observer, with applications such as optimization of contrast-enhanced medical imaging systems, and creation of a diversified image dataset with characteristics of a desired population. © 2016 SPIE.","Anthropomorphic numerical observer; Human visual system properties; QUEST adaptive threshold seeking; Virtual clinical trials","Location; Mammography; Tissue; Tomography; Virtual reality; X ray screens; Adaptive thresholds; Anthropomorphic models; Breast tomosynthesis; Clinical trial; Contrast-enhanced; Human Visual System; Numerical observer; Visibility threshold; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976316416

Our method requires participants to make a same/different judgment on two simple silhouettes. One silhouette is presented in an area that falls within the binocular scotoma while they are fixating the center of the screen with their preferred retinal locus (PRL); the other silhouette is presented diametrically opposite within the intact visual field. Over the course of 480 trials (approximately 6 hr), we gradually reduced the amount of time that participants have to make a saccade and judge the similarity of stimuli. This requires that they direct their PRL first toward the stimulus that is initially hidden behind the scotoma. Results from nine participants show that all participants could complete the task faster with training without sacrificing accuracy on the same/different judgment task. Although a majority of participants were able to direct their PRL toward the initially hidden stimulus, the ability to do so varied between participants. Specifically, six of nine participants made faster saccades with training. A smaller set (four of nine) made accurate saccades inside or close to the target area and retained this strategy 2 to 3 months after training. Subjective reports suggest that training increased awareness of the scotoma location for some individuals. However, training did not transfer to a different visual search task. Nevertheless, our study suggests that increasing scotoma awareness and training participants to look toward their scotoma may help them acquire missing information.","Central field loss; Low vision; Macular degeneration; Preferred retinal locus; Scotoma awareness","aged; eye movement; female; human; learning; macular degeneration; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; patient education; physiology; saccadic eye movement; scotoma; very elderly; vision; visual field; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Learning; Macular Degeneration; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Saccades; Scotoma; Visual Fields; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010410427

However, it only provides the LV boundaries in discrete 2D planes, and the 3D LV geometry needs to be reconstructed from those planes to quantify LV wall motion, acceleration, and strain, or to carry out flow simulations. An automated method is developed for the reconstruction of the 3D LV endocardial surface using echo from a few standard cross sections, in contrast with the previous work that has used a series of 2D scans in a linear or rotational manner for 3D reconstruction. The concept is based on a generalized approach so that the number or type (long-axis (LA) or short-axis (SA)) of sectional data is not constrained.

The stones that form in the kidney and migrate to the ureter can create a substantial health problem due to the pain caused by interaction of the ureteral walls and stones during the peristaltic motion. Threedimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out using the commercial code ANSYS FLUENT to solve for the peristaltic movement of the ureter, with and without stones. The effect of stone size was considered through the investigation of varying obstructions of 5%, 15%, and 35% for fixed spherical stone shape. Also, an understanding of the effect of stone shape was obtained through separate CFD calculations of the peristaltic ureter with three different types of stones, a sphere, a cube, and a star, all at a fixed obstruction percentage of 15%. Velocity vectors, mass flow rates, pressure gradients, and wall shear stresses were analyzed along one bolus of urine during peristalsis of the ureteral wall to study the various effects. It was found that the increase in obstruction increased the backflow, pressure gradients, and wall shear stresses proximal to the stone. On the other hand, with regard to the stone shape study, while the cube-shaped stones resulted in the largest backflow, the star-shaped stone showed highest pressure gradient magnitudes. Interestingly, the change in stone shape did not have a significant effect on the wall shear stress at the obstruction level studied here.

Ambiguous sensory inputs yield such perceptual multistability. Despite numerous empirical studies using binocular rivalry or plaid pattern motion, the driving mechanisms behind the spontaneous transitions between alternatives remain unclear. In the current work, we used a tristable barber pole motion stimulus combining empirical and modeling approaches to elucidate the contributions of noise and adaptation to underlying competition. We first robustly characterized the coupling between perceptual reports of transitions and continuously recorded eye direction, identifying a critical window of 480 ms before button presses, within which both measures were most strongly correlated. Second, we identified a novel nonmonotonic relationship between stimulus contrast and average perceptual switching rate with an initially rising rate before a gentle reduction at higher contrasts. A neural fields model of the underlying dynamics introduced in previous theoretical work and incorporating noise and adaptation mechanisms was adapted, extended, and empirically validated. Noise and adaptation contributions were confirmed to dominate at the lower and higher contrasts, respectively. Model simulations, with two free parameters controlling adaptation dynamics and direction thresholds, captured the measured mean transition rates for participants. We verified the shift from noise-dominated toward adaptation-driven in both the eye direction distributions and intertransition duration statistics. This work combines modeling and empirical evidence to demonstrate the signal-strength-dependent interplay between noise and adaptation during tristability. We propose that the findings generalize beyond the barber pole stimulus case to ambiguous perception in continuous feature spaces.","Adaptation; Competition model; Eye movements; Multistable motion perception; Noise","adaptation; female; human; male; motion; movement perception; noise; photostimulation; physiology; theoretical model; Adaptation, Physiological; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Motion; Motion Perception; Noise; Photic Stimulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010461181

TASim has recently been extended for hardware-in-the-loop operation in support of telescope and camera hardware development and control and tracking software improvements. All three SOFIA optical tracking cameras are simulated, including the Focal Plane Imager (FPI), which has recently been upgraded to the status of a science instrument that can be used on its own or in parallel with one of the seven infrared science instruments. The simulation includes tracking camera image simulation of starfields based on the UCAC4 catalog at real-time rates of 4-20 frames per second. For its role in training and planning, it is important for the tracker image simulation to provide images with a realistic appearance and response to changes in operating parameters. For its role in tracker software improvements, it is vital to have realistic signal and noise levels and precise star positions. The design of the software simulation for precise subpixel starfield rendering (including radial distortion), realistic point-spread function as a function of focus, tilt, and collimation, and streaking due to telescope motion will be described.

Methods: We developed a physical model for the spread of an Ebola-like virus. The scenario involved 3 computerized mannequins. One case was a febrile patient after Ebola exposure. Four residents (group A) had only masks and gloves and were initially unaware of exposure history, whereas 4 residents (group C) had known exposure history and had full PPE present in the room. Infected mannequins and surrounding surfaces were coated with Glo Germ, a UV tracer. Fluorescence to UV light was recorded after each scenario. Both tracer groups were compared with a control group (group B) in which no tracer was used to account for background fluorescence. Results: There was transfer of contagion to providers, other patients, nurse and family member confederates, and other treatment rooms. Half of group C used full PPE, and half used partial PPE. There were 3 contaminations in group C with full PPE use, 15 contaminations in group C with partial PPE, and 65 contaminations in group A. Conclusions: The UV tracer seems to be a useful analog of contaminated bodily fluids because it spread easily and its spread decreased with the use of barrier methods. This model could be used in future studies to measure the effectiveness of different forms of PPE and to study the effectiveness of provider education on appropriately donning and doffing PPE. © 2016 Society for Simulation in Healthcare.","Ebola; Healthcare-acquired infections; Healthcare-associated infections; Infectious diseases; Personal protective equipment; Simulation","body fluid; education; emergency medicine; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; hospital emergency service; human; infection control; medical education; organization and management; protective equipment; simulation training; utilization; Body Fluids; Emergency Medicine; Emergency Service, Hospital; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Infection Control; Internship and Residency; Personal Protective Equipment; Simulation Training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964089871

NB-MO uses image features extracted from polar-maps in order to predict lesion detection, localization and severity scores given by human readers in a series of 3D SPECT-MPI. The population used to tune (i.e. train) the NB-MO consisted of simulated SPECT-MPI cases - divided into normals or with lesions in variable sizes and locations - reconstructed using filtered backprojection (FBP) method. An ensemble of five human specialists (physicians) read a subset of simulated reconstructed images, and assigned a perfusion score for each region of the left-ventricle (LV). Polar-maps generated from the simulated volumes along with their corresponding human scores were used to train five NB-MOs (one per human reader), which are subsequently applied (i.e. tested) on three sets of clinical SPECT-MPI polar maps, in order to predict human detection and localization scores. The clinical ""testing"" population comprises healthy individuals and patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) in three possible regions, namely: LAD, LcX and RCA. Each clinical case was reconstructed using three reconstruction strategies, namely: FBP with no SC (i.e. scatter compensation), OSEM with Triple Energy Window (TEW) SC method, and OSEM with Effective Source Scatter Estimation (ESSE) SC. Alternative Free-Response (AFROC) analysis of perfusion scores shows that NB-MO predicts a higher human performance for scatter-compensated reconstructions, in agreement with what has been reported in published literature. These results suggest that NB-MO has good potential to generalize well to reconstruction methods not used during training, even for reasonably dissimilar datasets (i.e. simulated vs. clinical). © 2016 SPIE.","Bayesian learning; Image quality assessment; Machine learning; Model observers; Polar-map; SPECT-MPI","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Bayesian learning; Detection and localization; Filtered back-projection methods; Image quality assessment; Image reconstruction methods; Model observer; Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI); SPECT-MPI; Image processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976316553

FLIM-FRET model-based estimation methods allow the quantitative retrieval of parameters such as the quenched (interacting) and unquenched (non-interacting) fractional populations of the donor fluorophore and/or the distance of the interactions. The quantitative accuracy of such model-based approaches is dependent on multiple factors such as signal-to-noise ratio and number of temporal points acquired when sampling the fluorescence decays. For high-throughput or in vivo applications of FLIM-FRET, it is desirable to acquire a limited number of temporal points for fast acquisition times. Yet, it is critical to acquire temporal data sets with sufficient information content to allow for accurate FLIM-FRET parameter estimation. Herein, an optimal experimental design approach based upon sensitivity analysis is presented in order to identify the time points that provide the best quantitative estimates of the parameters for a determined number of temporal sampling points. More specifically, the D-optimality criterion is employed to identify, within a sparse temporal data set, the set of time points leading to optimal estimations of the quenched fractional population of the donor fluorophore. Overall, a reduced set of 10 time points (compared to a typical complete set of 90 time points) was identified to have minimal impact on parameter estimation accuracy (∼5%), with in silico and in vivo experiment validations. This reduction of the number of needed time points by almost an order of magnitude allows the use of FLIMFRET for certain high-throughput applications which would be infeasible if the entire number of time sampling points were used. © 2015 Omer et al.

Map of relative elevation from the nearest stream summarized both soil fertility and hydromorphic characteristics, with seasonally inundated bottomlands having higher soil phosphate content and base saturation, and plateaus having higher soil carbon, nitrogen and aluminum contents. We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve autocorrelation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa with at least one stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24.5% of species) and well-drained plateaus (48.9% of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13.8% and 10.6%, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70% of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations.

Most previous explanations identify the driver of the AMO as the ocean circulation, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we show that the main features of the observed AMO are reproduced in models where the ocean heat transport is prescribed and thus cannot be the driver. Allowing the ocean circulation to interact with the atmosphere does not significantly alter the characteristics of the AMO in the current generation of climate models. These results suggest that the AMO is the response to stochastic forcing from the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, with thermal coupling playing a role in the tropics. In this view, the AMOC and other ocean circulation changes would be largely a response to, not a cause of, the AMO.",,"air-sea interaction; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; climate variation; heat transfer; oceanic circulation; oscillation; Article; Atlantic Ocean; atmosphere; climate; climate change; heat; oscillation; priority journal; sea; simulation; Atlantic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945176467

The control strategy during targeted movementsmay also take into account the rewards or costs of any outcomes thatmay occur. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that movement time in Fitts' Law emerges not only from the accuracy constraints of the task, but also depends on the perceived cost of error formissing the targets. Subjects were asked to touch targets on an iPad1 screen with different costs for missed targets. We manipulated the probability of error by comparing children with dystonia (who are characterized by increased intrinsicmotor variability) to typically developing children. The results show a strong effect of the cost of error on the Fitts' Law relationship characterized by an increase inmovement time as cost increased. In addition, we observed a greater sensitivity to increased cost for children with dystonia, and this behavior appears to minimize the average cost. The findings support a proposed mathematical model that explains howmovement time in a Fitts-like task is related to perceived risk.

The timing of this endosymbiosis relative to the evolution of eukaryotic features remains subject to considerable debate, yet the evolutionary process itself constrains the timing of these events. Endosymbiosis entailed levels-of-selection conflicts, and mechanisms of conflict mediation had to evolve for eukaryogenesis to proceed. The initial mechanisms of conflict mediation (e.g. signalling with calcium and soluble adenylyl cyclase, substrate carriers, adenine nucleotide translocase, uncouplers) led to metabolic homeostasis in the eukaryotic cell. Later mechanisms (e.g. mitochondrial gene loss) contributed to the chimeric eukaryotic genome. These integral features of eukaryotes were derived because of, and therefore subsequent to, endosymbiosis. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for conflict arose with the emergence of eukaryotic sex, involving whole-cell fusion. A simple mode1demonstrates that competition on the lower leve1severely hinders the evolution of sex. Cytoplasmic mixing, however, is beneficial for non-cooperative endosymbionts, which could have used their aerobic metabolism to manipulate the life history of the host. While early evolution of sex may have facilitated symbiont acquisition, sex would have also destabilized the subsequent endosymbiosis. More plausibly, the evolution of sex and the true nucleus concluded the transition. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This approach involves the expression of exogenous light-sensitive proteins (opsins) in target heart tissue via viral gene or cell delivery. Preliminary experiments in optogenetically-modified cells, tissue, and organisms have made great strides towards demonstrating the feasibility of basic applications, including the use of light stimuli to pace or disrupt reentrant activity. However, it remains unknown whether techniques based on this intriguing technology could be scaled up and used in humans for novel clinical applications, such as pain-free optical defibrillation or dynamic modulation of action potential shape. A key step towards answering such questions is to explore potential optogenetics-based therapies using sophisticated computer simulation tools capable of realistically representing opsin delivery and light stimulation in biophysically detailed, patient-specific models of the human heart. This review provides (1) a detailed overview of the methodological developments necessary to represent optogenetics-based solutions in existing virtual heart platforms and (2) a survey of findings that have been derived from such simulations and a critical assessment of their significance with respect to the progress of the field. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cardiac arrhythmia; Cardiac optogenetics; Cell delivery; Light attenuation; Multiscale computational simulations; Optical stimulation; Viral gene delivery","Cells; Cytology; Gene expression; Gene transfer; Genes; Medical computing; Tissue; Cardiac arrhythmia; Cell delivery; Computational simulation; Light attenuation; Optical stimulation; Optogenetics; Viral genes; Heart; opsin; action potential; action potential duration; Article; cardiac optogenetics; computer simulation; defibrillation; electrostimulation; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle cell; heart muscle conduction system; human; illumination; light scattering; membrane current; nonhuman; optogenetics; photosensitization; priority journal; Purkinje fiber; sinus rhythm; viral gene delivery system; animal; biological model; heart; heart disease; pathophysiology; Animals; Computer Simulation; Heart; Heart Diseases; Humans; Models, Cardiovascular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942370059

A recent extension of Shepard's rational theory of dimensional generalization allows an explanation of data from both areas within a single framework. However, the conceptualization of dimensional integrality in this theory (the direction hypothesis) is different from that favored by Shepard in his original theory (the correlation hypothesis). Here, we report two experiments that test differential predictions of these two notions of integrality. Each experiment takes a design from compound generalization and translates it into a design for dimensional generalization by replacing discrete stimulus components with dimensional values. Experiment 1 showed that an effect analogous to summation is found in dimensional generalization with separable dimensions, but the opposite effect is found with integral dimensions. Experiment 2 showed that the analogue of a biconditional discrimination is solved faster when stimuli vary in integral dimensions than when stimuli vary in separable dimensions. These results, which are analogous to more ""non-linear"" processing with integral than with separable dimensions, were predicted by the direction hypothesis, but not by the correlation hypothesis. This confirms the assumptions of the unified rational theory of stimulus generalization and reveals interesting links between compound and dimensional generalization phenomena. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Causal learning; Configural and elemental processing; Generalization; Rational theory; Separable and integral dimensions","adult; Article; experimental design; feedback system; group dynamics; human; human experiment; instrumental conditioning; learning; prediction; priority journal; simulation; state dependent learning; stimulus; stimulus generalization; undergraduate student; young adult; adolescent; causality; concept formation; female; learning; male; physiology; psychological model; Adolescent; Causality; Concept Formation; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Learning; Male; Models, Psychological; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936869226

Learning in MLM consists in building a linear mapping between input and output distance matrices. In the generalization phase, the learned distance map is used to provide an estimate of the distance from K output reference points to the unknown target output value. Then, the output estimation is formulated as multilateration problem based on the predicted output distance and the locations of the reference points. Given its general formulation, the Minimal Learning Machine is inherently capable of operating on nonlinear regression problems as well as on multidimensional response spaces. In addition, an intuitive extension of the MLM is proposed to deal with classification problems.

These interactions can be approximated using a vertical kinetic energy (VKE) flux method, which predicts that the maximum power generation potential is 26% of the instantaneous downward transport of kinetic energy using the preturbine climatology. We compare the energy flux method to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model equipped with a wind turbine parameterization over a 105 km2 region in the central United States. The WRF simulations yield a maximum generation of 1.1 We·m-2, whereas the VKE method predicts the time series while underestimating the maximum generation rate by about 50%. Because VKE derives the generation limit from the preturbine climatology, potential changes in the vertical kinetic energy flux from the free atmosphere are not considered. Such changes are important at night when WRF estimates are about twice the VKE value because wind turbines interact with the decoupled nocturnal low-level jet in this region. Daytime estimates agree better to 20% because the wind turbines induce comparatively small changes to the downward kinetic energy flux. This combination of downward transport limits and wind speed reductions explains why large-scale wind power generation in windy regions is limited to about 1 We·m-2, with VKE capturing this combination in a comparatively simple way.","Extraction limits; Generation limits; Kinetic energy flux; Turbine-atmosphere interactions; Wind resource","Article; atmosphere; climate; controlled study; electricity; energy resource; energy transfer; priority journal; simulation; United States; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941242205

The analysis of the recordings begins with the detection of the action potentials (APs), followed by a classification step where each AP is associated with a given neural source. A feature extraction step is required prior to classification in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data and the impact of noise, allowing source clustering algorithms to work more efficiently. New method: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-sensor AP feature extraction based on the so-called Matched Subspace Detector (MSD), which is shown to be a natural generalization of standard single-sensor algorithms. Results: Clustering using both simulated data and real AP recordings taken in the locust antennal lobe demonstrates that the proposed approach yields features that are discriminatory and lead to promising results. Comparison with existing method(s): Unlike existing methods, the proposed algorithm finds joint spatio-temporal feature vectors that match the dominant subspace observed in the two-dimensional data without needs for a forward propagation model and AP templates. Conclusions: The proposed MSD approach provides more discriminatory features for unsupervised AP sorting applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Dimensionality reduction; Feature extraction; Spike detection; Spike sorting","action potential; algorithm; Article; extraction; matched subspace detector; nerve cell; noise; nonhuman; priority journal; sensor; single unit activity; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical parameters; waveform; action potential; animal; automated pattern recognition; biological model; cluster analysis; computer simulation; electrode; human; physiology; principal component analysis; wavelet analysis; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Electrodes; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Principal Component Analysis; Wavelet Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937878720

T., Department of Neuroscience, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States","The precedence effect (PE) is an auditory illusion that occurs when listeners localize nearly coincident and similar sounds from different spatial locations, such as a direct sound and its echo. It has mostly been studied in humans and animals with immobile heads in the horizontal plane; speaker pairs were often symmetrically located in the frontal hemifield. The present study examined the PE in head-unrestrained cats for a variety of pairedsound conditions along the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes. Cats were trained with operant conditioning to direct their gaze to the perceived sound location. Stereotypical PE-like behaviors were observed for speaker pairs placed in azimuth or diagonally in the frontal hemifield as the interstimulus delay was varied. For speaker pairs in the median sagittal plane, no clear PE-like behavior occurred. Interestingly, when speakers were placed diagonally in front of the cat, certain PE-like behavior emerged along the vertical dimension. However, PE-like behavior was not observed when both speakers were located in the left hemifield. A Hodgkin-Huxley model was used to simulate responses of neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) to sound pairs in azimuth. The novel simulation incorporated a lowthreshold potassium current and frequency mismatches to generate internal delays. The model exhibited distinct PE-like behavior, such as summing localization and localization dominance. The simulation indicated that certain encoding of the PE could have occurred before information reaches the inferior colliculus, and MSO neurons with binaural inputs having mismatched characteristic frequencies may play an important role. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.","Free field; Echo threshold; Head-related transfer function; Localization; Medial superior olive","potassium; potassium; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cat; controlled study; female; gaze; head; Hodgkin Huxley equation; inferior colliculus; instrumental conditioning; latent period; medial superior olive; nervous system parameters; nonhuman; olivary nucleus; phantom; potassium current; precedence effect; priority journal; saccadic eye movement; sound; action potential; animal; auditory stimulation; biological model; computer simulation; eye movement; head; metabolism; nerve cell; physiology; sound detection; Acoustic Stimulation; Action Potentials; Animals; Cats; Computer Simulation; Conditioning, Operant; Eye Movements; Female; Head; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Potassium; Sound Localization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940094732

Despite being paragons of high-density living, the social insects have largely decoupled the association with density-dependent epidemics. It is hypothesized that this is accomplished through prophylactic and inducible defenses termed ""collective immunity"". Here we characterise segregation of carpenter ants that would be most likely to encounter infectious agents (i.e. foragers) using integrated social, spatial, and temporal analyses. Importantly, we do this in the absence of disease to establish baseline colony organization. Behavioural and social network analyses show that active foragers engage in more trophallaxis interactions than their nest worker and queen counterparts and occupy greater area within the nest. When the temporal ordering of social interactions is taken into account, active foragers and inactive foragers are not observed to interact with the queen in ways that could lead to the meaningful transfer of disease. Furthermore, theoretical resource spread analyses show that such temporal segregation does not appear to impact the colony-wide flow of food. This study provides an understanding of a complex society's organization in the absence of disease that will serve as a null model for future studies in which disease is explicitly introduced.",,"animal; animal behavior; ant; computer simulation; female; movement (physiology); physiology; social behavior; spatiotemporal analysis; time factor; Animals; Ants; Behavior, Animal; Computer Simulation; Female; Movement; Social Behavior; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940055945

Decoding algorithms for brain-machine interfacing (BMI) are typically only optimized to reduce the magnitude of decoding errors. Our goal was to systematically quantify how four characteristics of BMI command signals impact closed-loop performance: (1) error magnitude, (2) distribution of different frequency components in the decoding errors, (3) processing delays, and (4) command gain. Approach. To systematically evaluate these different command features and their interactions, we used a closed-loop BMI simulator where human subjects used their own wrist movements to command the motion of a cursor to targets on a computer screen. Random noise with three different power distributions and four different relative magnitudes was added to the ongoing cursor motion in real time to simulate imperfect decoding. These error characteristics were tested with four different visual feedback delays and two velocity gains. Main results. Participants had significantly more trouble correcting for errors with a larger proportion of low-frequency, slow-time-varying components than they did with jittery, higher-frequency errors, even when the error magnitudes were equivalent. When errors were present, a movement delay often increased the time needed to complete the movement by an order of magnitude more than the delay itself. Scaling down the overall speed of the velocity command can actually speed up target acquisition time when low-frequency errors and delays are present. Significance. This study is the first to systematically evaluate how the combination of these four key command signal features (including the relatively-unexplored error power distribution) and their interactions impact closed-loop performance independent of any specific decoding method. The equations we derive relating closed-loop movement performance to these command characteristics can provide guidance on how best to balance these different factors when designing BMI systems. The equations reported here also provide an efficient way to compare a diverse range of decoding options offline. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain-computer interface; brain-machine interface; closed-loop control; neuroprosthesis; visually-guided reaching","Algorithms; Decoding; Errors; Human computer interaction; Interfaces (computer); Neural prostheses; Neurosurgery; Visual communication; Brain machine interface; Brain-machine interfacing; Closed-loop control; Closed-loop performance; Different frequency; Error characteristics; Neuro-prosthesis; visually-guided reaching; Brain computer interface; arm movement; Article; brain computer interface; closed loop brain machine interfacing stimulator; female; frequency modulation; human; male; motoneuron; neurological equipment; normal human; power spectrum; primary motor cortex; priority journal; proprioceptive feedback; signal processing; simulator; visual feedback; wrist; energy transfer; information retrieval; movement (physiology); physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; reaction time; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; sensory feedback; time factor; vision; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Energy Transfer; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male; Movement; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time Factors; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937510621

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent a technology with the potential to rehabilitate a range of traumatic and degenerative nervous system conditions but require a time-consuming training process to calibrate. An area of BCI research known as transfer learning is aimed at accelerating training by recycling previously recorded training data across sessions or subjects. Training data, however, is typically transferred from one electrode configuration to another without taking individual head anatomy or electrode positioning into account, which may underutilize the recycled data. Approach. We explore transfer learning with the use of source imaging, which estimates neural activity in the cortex. Transferring estimates of cortical activity, in contrast to scalp recordings, provides a way to compensate for variability in electrode positioning and head morphologies across subjects and sessions. Main results. Based on simulated and measured electroencephalography activity, we trained a classifier using data transferred exclusively from other subjects and achieved accuracies that were comparable to or surpassed a benchmark classifier (representative of a real-world BCI). Our results indicate that classification improvements depend on the number of trials transferred and the cortical region of interest. Significance. These findings suggest that cortical source-based transfer learning is a principled method to transfer data that improves BCI classification performance and provides a path to reduce BCI calibration time. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","braincomputer interface; electroencephalography (EEG); inverse imaging; non-invasive; source imaging; transfer learning","Classification (of information); Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Human computer interaction; Image segmentation; Interfaces (computer); Neurons; Recycling; Anatomical information; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Classification performance; Electrode configurations; Electrode positioning; non-invasive; Source imaging; Transfer learning; Brain computer interface; Article; brain computer interface; brain cortex; cell activity; classifier; computer simulation; discriminant analysis; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; evoked visual response; human; machine learning; motion analysis system; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; primary auditory cortex; priority journal; steady state; algorithm; anatomic model; anatomy and histology; automated pattern recognition; biological model; brain mapping; information retrieval; physiology; procedures; Algorithms; Brain Mapping; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Cerebral Cortex; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Models, Anatomic; Models, Neurological; Pattern Recognition, Automated",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937432974

The use of micro-electrode arrays to measure electrical activity from the surface of the brain is increasingly being investigated as a means to improve seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization. In this work, we used a multivariate autoregressive model to determine the evolution of seizure dynamics in the Hz high frequency band across micro-domains sampled by such micro-electrode arrays. We showed that a directed transfer function (DTF) can be used to estimate the flow of seizure activity in a set of simulated micro-electrode data with known propagation pattern. Approach. We used seven complex partial seizures recorded from four patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for surgical evaluation to reconstruct the seizure propagation pattern over sliding windows using a DTF measure. Main results. We showed that a DTF can be used to estimate the flow of seizure activity in a set of simulated micro-electrode data with a known propagation pattern. In general, depending on the location of the micro-electrode grid with respect to the clinical SOZ and the time from seizure onset, ictal propagation changed in directional characteristics over a 2-10 s time scale, with gross directionality limited to spatial dimensions of approximately . It was also seen that the strongest seizure patterns in the high frequency band and their sources over such micro-domains are more stable over time and across seizures bordering the clinically determined SOZ than inside. Significance. This type of propagation analysis might in future provide an additional tool to epileptologists for characterizing epileptogenic tissue. This will potentially help narrowing down resection zones without compromising essential brain functions as well as provide important information about targeting anti-epileptic stimulation devices. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","directed transfer function; high gamma band; micro seizure propagation","Brain; Electrodes; Frequency bands; Well stimulation; Directed transfer functions; Directional characteristic; Electrical activities; Gamma band; High frequency bands; Microelectrode array; Multivariate autoregressive models; Surgical evaluations; Transfer functions; Article; brain function; case report; complex partial seizure; controlled study; depth electrode; directed transfer function; disease activity; epileptic focus; female; human; male; mathematical model; microelectrode; neuromonitoring; priority journal; seizure; seizure onset zone; action potential; biological model; brain; brain mapping; computer simulation; electroencephalography; nerve cell; nerve cell network; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; seizure; sensitivity and specificity; Action Potentials; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Reproducibility of Results; Seizures; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937485165

A new training-free framework was proposed for target detection in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using joint frequency-phase coding. Approach. The key idea is to transfer SSVEP templates from the existing subjects to a new subject to enhance the detection of SSVEPs. Under this framework, transfer template-based canonical correlation analysis (tt-CCA) methods were developed for single-channel and multi-channel conditions respectively. In addition, an online transfer template-based CCA (ott-CCA) method was proposed to update EEG templates by online adaptation. Main results. The efficiency of the proposed framework was proved with a simulated BCI experiment. Compared with the standard CCA method, tt-CCA obtained an 18.78% increase of accuracy with a data length of 1.5 s. A simulated test of ott-CCA further received an accuracy increase of 2.99%. Significance.

To describe a toolkit of components for mathematical models of the relationship between cortical neural activity and space-resolved and time-resolved flows and volumes of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin motivated by optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI). Approach. Both blood flow and blood volume and both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and their interconversion are accounted for. Flow and volume are described by including analogies to both resistive and capacitive electrical circuit elements. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and their interconversion are described by generalization of Kirchhoff's laws based on well-mixed compartments. Main results.

In turn, increased vegetation productivity reduces albedo, which causes a positive feedback on temperature. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), regional vegetation greening has also been observed in response to recent warming. Here, we show that in contrast to arctic regions, increased growing season vegetation activity over the TP may have attenuated surface warming. This negative feedback on growing season vegetation temperature is attributed to enhanced evapotranspiration (ET). The extra energy available at the surface, which results from lower albedo, is efficiently dissipated by evaporative cooling. The net effect is a decrease in daily maximum temperature and the diurnal temperature range, which is supported by statistical analyses of in situ observations and by decomposition of the surface energy budget. A daytime cooling effect from increased vegetation activity is also modeled from a set of regional weather research and forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model simulations, but with a magnitude smaller than observed, likely because the WRF model simulates a weaker ET enhancement. Our results suggest that actions to restore native grasslands in degraded areas, roughly one-third of the plateau, will both facilitate a sustainable ecological development in this region and have local climate cobenefits. More accurate simulations of the biophysical coupling between the land surface and the atmosphere are needed to help understand regional climate change over the TP, and possible larger scale feedbacks between climate in the TP and the Asian monsoon system.","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Feedback; Tibetan Plateau; Vegetation","Arctic; Article; cooling; decomposition; energy transfer; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; forecasting; grassland; growing season; negative feedback; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; simulation; vegetation; warming; weather; agriculture; Asia; chemistry; China; climate; climate change; computer simulation; ecology; evapotranspiration; geography; Poaceae; statistical model; temperature; theoretical model; water; Agriculture; Asia; Climate; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Ecology; Geography; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Plant Transpiration; Poaceae; Temperature; Tibet; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938150483

Much less is known about how local ensembles function in inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the last stage of the ventral visual pathway that supports visual recognition. Previous reports suggested that nearby neurons carry information mostly independently, supporting efficient processing (Barlow, 1961). However, others postulate that noise covariation effects may depend on network anisotropy/homogeneity and on how the covariation relates to representation. Do slow trial-by-trial noise covariations increase or decrease IT’s object coding capability, how does encoding capability relate to correlational structure (i.e., the spatial pattern of signal and noise redundancy/homogeneity across neurons), and does knowledge of correlational structure matter for decoding? We recorded simultaneously from ~80 spiking neurons in ~1 mm3 of macaque IT under light neurolept anesthesia. Noise correlations were stronger for neurons with correlated tuning, and noise covariations reduced object encoding capability, including generalization across object pose and illumination. Knowledge of noise covariations did not lead to better decoding performance. However, knowledge of anisotropy/homogeneity improved encoding and decoding efficiency by reducing the number of neurons needed to reach a given performance level. Such correlated neurons were found mostly in supragranular and infragranular layers, supporting theories that link recurrent circuitry to manifold representation. These results suggest that redundancy benefits manifold learning of complex high-dimensional information and that subsets of neurons may be more immune to noise covariation than others. © 2015 the authors.","Efficient coding; Macaque; Multielectrode array; Noise correlation; Object recognition; Vision","animal experiment; anisotropy; Article; coding; female; illumination; inferior temporal cortex; Macaca; male; noise; nonhuman; performance; population size; priority journal; spike; striate cortex; visual memory; visual stimulation; action potential; animal; anisotropy; computer simulation; cytology; learning; nerve cell; photostimulation; physiology; statistics; support vector machine; temporal lobe; time; vision; visual system; Action Potentials; Animals; Anisotropy; Computer Simulation; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Macaca; Male; Neurons; Photic Stimulation; Statistics as Topic; Support Vector Machines; Temporal Lobe; Time Factors; Visual Pathways; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936862724

First, 3D magnetic resonance temperature imaging (MRTI) data are used to quantify blood flow-related energy losses, including the effects of perfusion and convection. Second, this information is used to calculate parameters of a BHTE model: in this paper the widely used Pennes BHTE. As a self-consistency check, the BHTE parameters are utilized to predict the temperatures from which they were initially derived. The approach is evaluated with finite-difference simulations and implemented experimentally with focused ultrasound heating of an ex vivo porcine kidney perfused at 0, 20 and 40 ml/min (n = 4 each). The simulation results demonstrate accurate quantification of blood flow-related energy losses, except in regions of sharp blood flow discontinuities, where the transitions are spatially smoothed. The smoothed transitions propagate into estimates of the Pennes perfusion parameter but have limited effect on the accuracy of temperature predictions using these estimates. Longer acquisition time periods mitigate the effects of MRTI noise, but worsen the effect of flow discontinuities. For the no-flow kidney experiments the estimates of a uniform, constant Pennes perfusion parameter are approximately zero, and at 20 and 40 ml/min the average estimates increase with flow rate to 3.0 and 4.2 kg/m3/s, respectively. When Pennes perfusion parameter values are allowed to vary spatially, but remain temporally constant, BHTE temperature predictions are more accurate than when using spatially uniform, constant Pennes perfusion values, with reductions in RMSE values of up to 79%. Locations with large estimated perfusion values correspond to high flow regions of the kidney observed in T1-weighted MR images. This novel, MRTI-based technique holds promise for improving understanding of thermal therapy biophysics and for evaluating biothermal models. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bioheat transfer; Blood flow; High intensity focused ultrasound; Magnetic resonance temperature imaging; Thermal modeling","Blood; Energy dissipation; Forecasting; Hemodynamics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Parameter estimation; Resonance; Ultrasonic applications; Bio-heat transfer; Blood flow; High intensity focused ultrasound; Resonance temperature; Thermal model; Magnetic resonance; accuracy; animal tissue; Article; bioheat transfer equation model; biological model; brain perfusion; cooling; echo planar imaging; energy expenditure; ex vivo study; experimental pig; heat transfer; kidney blood flow; kidney perfusion; magnetic resonance temperature imaging; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; regional perfusion; signal noise ratio; thermal conductivity; thermal diffusion; thermodynamics; three dimensional imaging; animal; biological model; blood flow velocity; body temperature; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; energy transfer; in vitro study; kidney; kidney circulation; magnetic resonance angiography; physiology; pig; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; thermography; thermoregulation; vascularization; Sus; Animals; Blood Flow Velocity; Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Computer Simulation; Energy Transfer; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; In Vitro Techniques; Kidney; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Models, Biological; Renal Circulation; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Swine; Thermography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931571756

Some microbes interact via syntrophic associations, in which the metabolic by-products of one species serve as nutrients for another. These associations sustain a variety of natural communities, including those involved in methanogenesis. In anaerobic syntrophic communities, energy is transferred from one species to another, either through direct contact and exchange of electrons, or through small molecule diffusion. Thermodynamics plays an important role in governing these interactions, as the oxidation reactions carried out by the first community member are only possible because degradation products are consumed by the second community member. This work presents the development and analysis of genome-scale network reconstructions of the bacterium Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans and the methanogenic archaeon Methanospirillum hungatei. The models were used to verify proposed mechanisms of ATP production within each species. We then identified additional constraints and the cellular objective function required to match experimental observations. The thermodynamic S. fumaroxidans model could not explain why S. fumaroxidans does not produce H2 in monoculture, indicating that current methods might not adequately estimate the thermodynamics, or that other cellular processes (e.g., regulation) play a role. We also developed a thermodynamic coculture model of the association between the organisms. The coculture model correctly predicted the exchange of both H2 and formate between the two species and suggested conditions under which H2 and formate produced by S. fumaroxidans would be fully consumed by M. hungatei. © 2015 Hamilton et al.",,"adenosine triphosphate; methane; propionic acid; hydrogen; Article; coculture; controlled study; Deltaproteobacteria; energy conservation; enzyme synthesis; methanogenesis; Methanospirillum hungatei; microbial community; nonhuman; proton transport; Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans; thermodynamics; biological model; computer simulation; energy transfer; metabolism; Methanospirillum; microbial consortium; physiology; symbiosis; thermodynamics; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanospirillum hungatei; Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans; Computer Simulation; Deltaproteobacteria; Energy Transfer; Hydrogen; Methane; Methanospirillum; Microbial Consortia; Models, Biological; Symbiosis; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938631407

An isolated sperm with a planar flagellar beat in a three-dimensional unbounded fluid domain would remain in a plane. However, because sperm must navigate through complex, three-dimensional confined spaces along with other sperm, forces that bend or move the flagellum out of its current beat plane develop. Here we present an extension of previous models of an elastic sperm flagellar filament whose shape change is driven by the pursuit of a preferred curvature wave. In particular, we extend the energy of the generalized elastica to include a term that penalizes out-of-plane motion. We are now able to study the interaction of free-swimmers in a 3D Stokes flow that do not start out beating in the same plane.

This definition is not appropriate for neural systems in which spiking activity is more accurately represented as point processes. We show that the SNR estimates a ratio of expected prediction errors and extend the standard definition to one appropriate for single neurons by representing neural spiking activity using point process generalized linear models (PP-GLM). We estimate the prediction errors using the residual deviances from the PP-GLM fits. Because the deviance is an approximate χ2 random variable, we compute a bias-corrected SNR estimate appropriate for single-neuron analysis and use the bootstrap to assess its uncertainty. In the analyses of four systems neuroscience experiments, we show that the SNRs are -10 dB to -3 dB for guinea pig auditory cortex neurons, -18 dB to -7 dB for rat thalamic neurons, -28 dB to -14 dB for monkey hippocampal neurons, and -29 dB to -20 dB for human subthalamic neurons. The new SNR definition makes explicit in the measure commonly used for physical systems the often-quoted observation that single neurons have low SNRs. The neuron's spiking history is frequently a more informative covariate for predicting spiking propensity than the applied stimulus. Our new SNR definition extends to any GLM system in which the factors modulating the response can be expressed as separate components of a likelihood function. © 2015 PNAS.","Neuron; Point processes; Signal-to-noise ratio; Simulation; SNR","Article; auditory cortex; guinea pig; Haplorhini; hippocampus; human; mathematical computing; nerve cell; nonhuman; predictive value; priority journal; signal noise ratio; spike wave; stimulus response; thalamus; action potential; animal; cytology; nerve cell; physiology; statistical model; Cavia; Rattus; Action Potentials; Animals; Auditory Cortex; Guinea Pigs; Likelihood Functions; Neurons; Signal-To-Noise Ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931287661

The creatine kinase (CK) reaction is a major energy reserve reaction that rapidly converts creatine phosphate (PCr) to ATP during the cardiac cycle and at times of stress and ischemia, but is significantly impaired in conditions such as hypertrophy and heart failure. Because the magnitudes of possible in vivo cyclic changes in cardiac high-energy phosphates (HEPs) during the cardiac cycle are not well known from previous work, this study uses mathematical modeling to assess whether, and to what extent, cyclic variations in HEPs and in the rate of ATP synthesis through CK (CK flux) could exist in the human heart, and whether they could be measured with current in vivo 31P MRS methods. Multi-site exchange models incorporating enzymatic rate equations were used to study the cyclic dynamics of the CK reaction, and Bloch equations were used to simulate 31P MRS saturation transfer measurements of the CK reaction. The simulations show that short-term buffering of ATP by CK requires temporal variations over the cardiac cycle in the CK reaction velocities modeled by enzymatic rate equations. The maximum variation in HEPs in the normal human heart beating at 60min-1 was approximately 0.4m m and proportional to the velocity of ATP hydrolysis. Such HEP variations are at or below the current limits of detection by in vivo 31P MRS methods. Bloch equation simulations show that 31P MRS saturation transfer estimates the time-averaged, pseudo-first-order forward rate constant, kf,ap′, of the CK reaction, and that periodic short-term fluctuations in kf′ and CK flux are not likely to be detectable in human studies employing current in vivo 31P MRS methods.

However, the prevalence of ""many-to-one"" association of cranial forms and functions in vertebrates suggests a complex interplay of ecological and evolutionary histories, resulting in redundant morphology-diet linkages. Here we examine the link between cranial biomechanical properties for taxa with different dietary preferences in crown clade Carnivora, the most diverse clade of carnivorous mammals. We test whether hypercarnivores and generalists can be distinguished based on cranial mechanical simulation models, and how such diet-biomechanics linkages relate to morphology. Comparative finite element and geometric morphometrics analyses document that predicted bite force is positively allometric relative to skull strain energy; this is achieved in part by increased stiffness in larger skull models and shape changes that resist deformation and displacement. Size-standardized strain energy levels do not reflect feeding preferences; instead, caniform models have higher strain energy than feliform models. This caniform-feliform split is reinforced by a sensitivity analysis using published models for six additional taxa. Nevertheless, combined bite force-strain energy curves distinguish hypercarnivorous versus generalist feeders. These findings indicate that the link between cranial biomechanical properties and carnivoran feeding preference can be clearly defined and characterized, despite phylogenetic and allometric effects. Application of this diet-biomechanics linkage model to an analysis of an extinct stem carnivoramorphan and an outgroup creodont species provides biomechanical evidence for the evolution of taxa into distinct hypercarnivorous and generalist feeding styles prior to the appearance of crown carnivoran clades with similar feeding preferences. © 2015 Tseng, Flynn.",,"allometry; Article; biomechanics; Canis lupus; Carnivora; controlled study; cranial biomechanical simulation; dietary intake; feeding behavior; finite element analysis; geometry; Herpestes javanicus; Mephitis mephitis; nonhuman; Oodectes herpestoides; Panthera pardus; phylogeny; raccoon; simulation; standardization; Thinocyon velox; Vulpavus ovatus; Vulpavus palustris; animal; biomechanics; diet; evolution; mastication; physiology; skull; species extinction; Carnivora; Mammalia; Vertebrata; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bite Force; Diet; Extinction, Biological; Feeding Behavior; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928742765

Analysts perform complex decision-making tasks that involve gathering, sorting, and analyzing information. The current study aimed to evaluate how individual differences influence performance in an Internet search-based medical diagnosis task designed to simulate a signals analyst task. The individual differences of interest included working memory capacity and previous experience with elements of the task, specifically health literacy, prior experience using the Internet, and prior experience conducting Internet searches. Preliminary results indicated that working memory significantly predicted performance on this medical diagnosis task; conversely, medical literacy, prior experience using the Internet, and Internet search experience were not significant predictors of performance. These results support previous research and provide additional evidence that working memory capacity greatly influences performance on cognitively complex decision-making tasks, whereas experience with elements of the task may not. These findings suggest that working memory capacity should be considered when screening individuals for signals intelligence analyst positions. Future research should aim to generalize these findings within a broader sample of individuals, ideally utilizing a task that directly replicates those performed by intelligence analysts.

Twenty-four older adults were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups (virtual reality training and control). Both groups underwent three sessions including baseline slip, training and transfer of training on slippery surface. Both groups experienced two slips, one during baseline and the other during the transfer of training trial. The training group underwent 12 simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a virtual reality scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group performed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected during all the sessions. Results demonstrated a reduced incidence of falls in the training group during the transfer of training trial as compared to the control group. The training group was able to transfer reactive control strategies learned during training to the second slip trial. The reactive adjustments included reduced slip distance. Additionally, gait parameters reflective of gait instability (stride length, step width, variability in stride velocity) reduced after walking in the VR environment for 15–20 min.

This potential cannot be realized unless accurate, reliable automated methods for spike sorting are developed, in turn requiring benchmarking data sets with known ground-truth spike times. New method: We here present a general simulation tool for computing benchmarking data for evaluation of spike-sorting algorithms entitled ViSAPy (Virtual Spiking Activity in Python). The tool is based on a well-established biophysical forward-modeling scheme and is implemented as a Python package built on top of the neuronal simulator NEURON and the Python tool LFPy. Results: ViSAPy allows for arbitrary combinations of multicompartmental neuron models and geometries of recording multielectrodes. Three example benchmarking data sets are generated, i.e., tetrode and polytrode data mimicking in vivo cortical recordings and microelectrode array (MEA) recordings of in vitro activity in salamander retinas. The synthesized example benchmarking data mimics salient features of typical experimental recordings, for example, spike waveforms depending on interspike interval. Comparison with existing methods: ViSAPy goes beyond existing methods as it includes biologically realistic model noise, synaptic activation by recurrent spiking networks, finite-sized electrode contacts, and allows for inhomogeneous electrical conductivities.

The Hubbard model - a simplified representation of fermions moving on a periodic lattice - is thought to describe the essential details of copper oxide superconductivity. This model describes many of the features shared by the copper oxides, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram. Realization of strongly correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realization of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. This temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a simple high-temperature series expansion, which brings our experiment close to the limit of the capabilities of current numerical techniques, particularly at metallic densities. We reach these low temperatures using a compensated optical lattice technique, in which the confinement of each lattice beam is compensated by a blue-detuned laser beam. The temperature of the atoms in the lattice is deduced by comparing the light scattering to determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations and numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, would open avenues for producing and characterizing other novel quantum states of matter, such as the pseudogap regime and correlated metallic states of the two-dimensional Hubbard model. © 2015, Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Simulation is often used to ""pretrain"" novices on endoscopic skills before real clinical practice; nonetheless, the optimal method of training remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare endoscopic virtual reality and physical model simulators and their respective roles in transferring skills to the clinical environment. Methods At the beginning of a skills development rotation, 27 surgical postgraduate year 1 residents performed a baseline screening colonoscopy on a real patient under faculty supervision. Their performances were scored using the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills (GAGES). Subsequently, interns completed a 3-week flexible endoscopy curriculum developed at our institution. One-third of the residents were assigned to train with the GI Mentor simulator, one-third trained with the Kyoto simulator, and one-third of the residents trained using both simulators. At the end of their rotations, each postgraduate year 1 resident performed one posttest colonoscopy on a different patient and was again scored using GAGES by an experienced faculty. Results A statistically significant improvement in the GAGES total score (p < 0.001) and on each of its subcomponents (p = 0.001) was observed from pretest to posttest for all groups combined. Subgroup analysis indicated that trainees in the GI Mentor or both simulators conditions showed significant improvement from pretest to posttest in terms of GAGES total score (p = 0.017 vs 0.024, respectively). This was not observed for those exclusively using the Kyoto platform (p = 0.072). Nonetheless, no single training condition was shown to be a better training modality when compared to others in terms of total GAGES score or in any of its subcomponents. Conclusion Colonoscopy simulator training with the GI Mentor platform exclusively or in combination with a physical model simulator improves skill performance in real colonoscopy cases when measured with the GAGES tool. © 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","flexible endoscopy; GAGES; simulation; skills assessment","adult; Article; clinical practice; clinical supervision; colonoscopy; curriculum development; evaluation study; female; flexible colonoscopy; human; intestine preparation; male; normal human; physical model; priority journal; psychomotor performance; resident; simulation; simulator; surgical training; virtual reality; clinical competence; colonoscope; colonoscopy; computer simulation; controlled study; education; epidemiology; fiber optics; medical education; pliability; problem based learning; procedures; randomized controlled trial; teacher; United States; Adult; Clinical Competence; Colonoscopes; Colonoscopy; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Fiber Optic Technology; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Mentors; Pliability; Problem-Based Learning; Sampling Studies; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925091689

Recent studies have attempted such classification of cerebellar interneurons (CINs) based on statistical measures of spontaneous activity. Previously, such efforts in different brain areas have used supervised clustering methods based on standard parameterizations of spontaneous interspike interval (ISI) histograms. We worried that this might bias researchers toward positive identification results and decided to take a different approach.Werecorded CINs from anesthetized cats. We used unsupervised clustering methods applied to a nonparametric representation of the ISI histograms to identify groups of CINs with similar spontaneous activity and then asked how these groups map onto different cell types. Our approach was a fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm applied to the Kullbach–Leibler distances between ISI histograms. We found that there is, in fact, a natural clustering of the spontaneous activity of CINs into six groups but that there was no relationship between this clustering and the standard morphologically defined cell types. These results proved robust when generalization was tested to completely new datasets, including datasets recorded under different anesthesia conditions and in different laboratories and different species (rats). Our results suggest the importance of an unsupervised approach in categorizing neurons according to their extracellular activity. Indeed, a reexamination of such categorization efforts throughout the brain may be necessary. One important open question is that of functional differences of our six spontaneously defined clusters during actual behavior. ©2015 the authors.","Cerebellar cortex interneurons; Fuzzy C-means clustering; Inter-spike interval","anesthesia; animal experiment; Article; behavior; brain function; cat; cell labeling; cell structure; cerebellum cortex; cluster analysis; fuzzy system; histogram; interneuron; morphological trait; mouse; multifactor dimensionality reduction; nerve conduction; nonhuman; priority journal; probability; Purkinje cell; spike wave; spontaneous Activity; action potential; algorithm; analogs and derivatives; animal; biological model; cerebellum; classification; computer simulation; cytology; interneuron; metabolism; physiology; rat; species difference; biotin; neurobiotin; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Biotin; Cats; Cerebellum; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Interneurons; Mice; Models, Neurological; Rats; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921931982

The TPP consists of a series of pseudorandom position-controlled trunk perturbations in an apparatus measuring forces and displacements at the harness surrounding the thorax. Intrinsic and reflexive contributions to low-back stiffness were estimated using a system identification procedure, leading to 12 parameters. Study 1 methods (reliability): 30 subjects performed five 75-. s trials, on each of two separate days (eight weeks apart). Reliability was assessed using the generalizability theory, which allowed computing indexes of dependability (ϕ, analogous to intraclass correlation coefficient) and standard errors of measurement (SEM). Study 2 methods (validity): 20 healthy subjects performed three 75-. s trials for each of five experimental conditions assumed to provide different lumbar stiffness; testing the construct validity of the TPP using four conditions with different lumbar belt designs and one control condition without. Study 1 results (reliability): Learning was seen between the first and following trials. Consequently, reliability analyses were performed without the first trial. Simulations showed that averaging the scores of three trials can lead to acceptable reliability results for some TPP parameters. Study 2 results (validity): All lumbar belt designs increased low-back intrinsic stiffness, while only some of them decreased reflex stiffness, which support the construct validity of the TPP. Overall, these findings support the use of the TPP to test the effect of rehabilitation or between-groups differences with regards to trunk stiffness. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Low back pain; Reflex; Rehabilitation; Reproducibility; Trunk stiffness","Belts; Computation theory; Patient rehabilitation; Reliability theory; Construct validity; Experimental conditions; Generalizability theories; Intraclass correlation coefficients; Low back pain; Reflex; Reproducibilities; System identification procedure; Stiffness; adult; Article; body posture; construct validity; controlled study; correlation coefficient; criterion related validity; female; human; human experiment; low back stiffness; lumbar spine; male; musculoskeletal stiffness; musculoskeletal system examination; normal human; range of motion; spinal reflex; systematic error; task performance; test retest reliability; trunk pertubation protocol; validation process; adolescent; aged; back; biomechanics; materials testing; mechanics; middle aged; physiology; procedures; reflex; reproducibility; thorax; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Back; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Male; Materials Testing; Mechanical Processes; Middle Aged; Reflex; Reproducibility of Results; Thorax; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920264408

Here we focus on the coordinate system used in the motor cortex to guide actions and examine physiological and psychophysical evidence for an allocentric reference frame based on spatial coordinates. When the equations of motion governing reaching dynamics are expressed as spatial vectors, each term is a vector cross product between a limb-segment position and a velocity or acceleration. We extend this computational framework to motor adaptation, in which the cross-product terms form adaptive bases for canceling imposed perturbations. Coefficients of the velocity- and acceleration-dependent cross products are assumed to undergo plastic changes to compensate the force-field or visuomotor perturbations. Consistent with experimental findings, each of the cross products had a distinct reference frame, which predicted how an acquired remapping generalized to untrained location in the workspace. In response to force field or visual rotation, mainly the coefficients of the velocity- or acceleration-dependent cross products adapted, leading to transfer in an intrinsic or extrinsic reference frame, respectively.

The experiment consisted of three phases. In the training phase, subjects threw beanbags underhand towards targets displayed on a wall-mounted touch screen. The distribution of their endpoints was a vertically elongated bivariate Gaussian. In the subsequent choice phase, subjects repeatedly chose which of two targets varying in shape and size they would prefer to attempt to hit. Their choices allowed us to investigate their internal models of visuo-motor error distribution, including the coordinate system in which they represented visuo-motor error. In the transfer phase, subjects repeated the choice phase from a different vantage point, the same distance from the screen but with the throwing direction shifted 45°. From the new vantage point, visuo-motor error was effectively expanded horizontally by √2. We found that subjects incorrectly assumed an isotropic distribution in the choice phase but that the anisotropy they assumed in the transfer phase agreed with an objectively correct transfer. We also found that the coordinate system used in coding two-dimensional visuo-motor error in the choice phase was effectively one-dimensional. © 2015 ARVO.","Choice; Movement planning; Perception and action; Representation; Transfer; Visuo-motor uncertainty","adolescent; adult; anisotropy; decision making; female; human; learning; male; normal distribution; physiology; psychomotor performance; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anisotropy; Choice Behavior; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Normal Distribution; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935455834

How the central nervous system builds and maintains memory of such dexterous manipulations remains unclear. We conducted experiments in which human subjects had to learn and recall manipulations performed in two contexts, A and B. Both contexts involved lifting the same L-shaped object whose geometry cued its asymmetrical mass distribution. Correct performance required producing a torque on the vertical handle at object lift onset to prevent it from tilting. The torque direction depended on the context, i.e., object orientation, which was changed by 180° object rotation about a vertical axis. With an A1B1A2context switching paradigm, subjects learned A1in the first block of eight trials as indicated by a torque approaching the required one. However, subjects made large errors in anticipating the required torque when switching to B1immediately after A1(negative transfer), as well as when they had to recall A1when switching to A2after learning B through another block of eight lifts (retrieval interference). Classic sensorimotor learning theories attribute such interferences to multi-rate, multistate error-driven updates of internal models. However, by systematically changing the interblock break duration and within-block number of trials, our results suggest an alternative explanation underlying interference and retention of dexterous manipulation. Specifically, we identified and quantified through a novel computational model the nonlinear interaction between two sensorimotor mechanisms: a shortlived, context-independent, use-dependent sensorimotor memory and a context-sensitive, error-based learning process. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.","Interference; Manipulation; Retention; Sensorimotor","adult; anticipation; Article; biomechanics; controlled study; dexterous manipulation; female; geometry; hand movement; human; human experiment; learning; learning theory; male; normal human; priority journal; recall; rotation; sensorimotor function; simulation; task performance; torque; touch; adolescent; biological model; computer simulation; hand; learning; randomized controlled trial; recall; sensory feedback; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Computer Simulation; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Hand; Humans; Learning; Male; Mental Recall; Models, Neurological; Rotation; Torque; Transfer (Psychology); Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920911224

Background: The laparoscopic surgical environment often involves visuomotor rotations because the laparoscope may be placed to the surgeon's side. Basic research by Cunningham indicated that visuomotor rotations between 90° and 135° result in peak performance decrements. Research by Ames and colleagues failed to replicate Cunningham's results in the laparoscopic environment, possibly due to (a) confounds from carryover effects or (b) use of an alternative laparoscopic training task rather than the straight-line pointing task used by Cunningham. Two experiments were conducted to determine if Cunningham's results generalize to the laparoscopic environment when controlling for carryover effects for a threedimensional ""straight-line"" pointing task (Experiment 1) and a laparoscopic training task (Experiment 2). Method: In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were assigned to one of five visuomotor rotations: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, or 180°. Utilizing a laparoscopic simulator, participants performed either a three-dimensional pointing task (Experiment 1) or a peg transfer task (Experiment 2). Results: In both experiments, visuomotor rotations of 90° or 135° resulted in the poorest performance. Conclusion: When controlling for carryover effects, Cunningham's results generalize to novices' performance of a pointing and a peg transfer task in the laparoscopic environment. Applications: The results indicate that 90° and 135° sideways laparoscope placements may result in worse performance for novices in the laparoscopic environment, indicating potentially longer learning curves for these conditions in the laparoscopic as well as other teleoperation environments. © 2014, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","laparoscopic training; laparoscopy; minimally invasive surgery; perceptual-motor adaptation; visuomotor rotations","Rotation; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Carry-over effects; Minimally invasive surgery; Motor adaptation; Novice performance; Peak performance; Surgical environment; Teleoperation environments; Visuomotors; Laparoscopy; adolescent; adult; bioengineering; clinical competence; computer simulation; devices; education; female; human; laparoscope; laparoscopy; male; perception; physiology; procedures; rotation; task performance; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Female; Human Engineering; Humans; Laparoscopes; Laparoscopy; Male; Perception; Rotation; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924897955

In order to get airborne, the air wing depends upon the skills of a small number of officers responsible for the safe and rapid launch of aircraft from the carrier deck. These officers, known as ""shooters"", receive initial classroom training on the systems they use then receive qualification to be launch officers through on-the-job training. Due to scheduling complexities the training to achieve qualification is disjointed and often requires trainees to go underway with different aircraft carriers to complete their training. The current approach results in burdens on the parent command, host commands, and the trainees. Of greater concern is the lack of consistency in the training of such a high risk activity. This paper describes the results of a job task analysis conducted to provide insights into the skills required to perform the duties of a launch officer. Further, the information from the job task analysis was examined and a representative finite state machine was developed and is presented. Finally, a portable, low-cost virtual environment created based on the work described above is discussed. It is proposed that the current virtual reality system used for this demonstration faithfully recreates the required attributes and scenarios to train launch officer tasks and that the prototype system, with proof of training transfer can reduce the burden on commands, trainees, and perhaps most importantly, provide consistent training.

Frontal eye field (FEF) neurons show robust, spatially selective delay period activity during memory-guided saccade tasks. We present a copula regression paradigm to examine neural interaction of these two types of signals between areas IT and FEF of the monkey during a working memory task. This paradigm is based on copula models that can account for both marginal distribution over spiking activity of individual neurons within each area and joint distribution over ensemble activity of neurons between areas. Considering the popular GLMs as marginal models, we developed a general and flexible likelihood framework that uses the copula to integrate separate GLMs into a joint regression analysis. Such joint analysis essentially leads to a multivariate analog of the marginal GLM theory and hence efficient model estimation. In addition, we show that Granger causality between spike trains can be readily assessed via the likelihood ratio statistic. The performance of this method is validated by extensive simulations, and compared favorably to the widely used GLMs. When applied to spiking activity of simultaneously recorded FEF and IT neurons during working memory task, we observed significant Granger causality influence from FEF to IT, but not in the opposite direction, suggesting the role of the FEF in the selection and retention of visual information during working memory. The copula model has the potential to provide unique neurophysiological insights about network properties of the brain. © 2015 the authors.","Copula; Generalized linear model; Neural data analysis; Spike trains","animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; Article; copula regression analysis; electroencephalogram; frontal eye field; granger causality analysis; inferior temporal cortex; learning and memory test; male; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; priority journal; regression analysis; rhesus monkey; spike wave; task performance; visual stimulation; working memory; action potential; animal; cytology; electrostimulation; eye movement; nerve cell; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; reaction time; regression analysis; short term memory; system analysis; temporal lobe; visual field; wakefulness; Action Potentials; Animals; Electric Stimulation; Eye Movements; Macaca mulatta; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Neurons; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Probability Theory; Reaction Time; Regression Analysis; Temporal Lobe; Visual Fields; Wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930905247

The purpose of this study was to determine how an error-focused training program affected performance, retention, and transfer of central venous catheter (CVC) placement skills when compared with traditional training methodologies. Methods Surgical interns (N = 30) participated in a 1-hour session featuring an instructional video and practice performing internal jugular (IJ) and subclavian (SC) CVC placement with guided instruction. All interns underwent baseline knowledge and skill assessment for IJ and SC (pretest) CVC placement; watched a ""correct-only"" (CO) or ""correct + error"" (CE) instructional video; practiced for 30 minutes; and were posttested on knowledge and IJ and SC CVC placement. Skill retention and transfer (femoral CVC placement) were assessed 30 days later. All skills tests (pretest, posttest, and transfer) were videorecorded and deidentified for evaluation by a single blinded instructor using a validated 17-item checklist. Results Both the groups exhibited significant improvements (p < 0.001) in knowledge and skills after the 1-hour training program, but the increase of items achieved on the performance checklist did not differ between conditions (CO: IJ Δ = 35%, SC Δ = 29%; CE: IJ Δ = 36%, subclavian Δ = 33%). However, 1 month later, the CO group exhibited significant declines in skill retention on IJ CVC placement (from 68% at posttraining to 44% at day 30; p < 0.05) and SC CVC placement (from 63% at posttraining to 49% at day 30; p < 0.05), whereas the CE group did not have significant decreases in performance. The CE group performed significantly better on femoral CVC placement (i.e., transfer task; 62% vs 38%; p < 0.01) and on 2 of the 3 complication scenarios (p < 0.05) when compared with the CO group. Conclusions These data indicate that incorporating error-based activities and discussions into training programs can be beneficial for skill retention and transfer. © 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","central line; error management training; Key Words simulation; retention; transfer","central venous catheter; central venous catheterization; checklist; clinical article; Conference Paper; human; intermethod comparison; internal jugular vein; knowledge; knowledge management; priority journal; resident; simulation training; skill; subclavian vein; surgical error; surgical training; videorecording; clinical competence; medical education; medical error; procedures; Catheterization, Central Venous; Clinical Competence; Humans; Internship and Residency; Medical Errors; Simulation Training",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940998635

The current study tests the hypothesis that skill acquisition is more rapid using RT than using CT among naive learners. Design and Participants A total of 40 subjects without laparoscopic or robotic surgical experience were enrolled and randomized to begin with either RT or CT. Then, 2 specific RT tasks were reproduced for CT and repeated 5 times each with RT and CT. Time and quality indicators were measured quantitatively. A crossover technique was used to control for in-study experience bias. Results The tasks ""pick and place jacks"" (PP) and ""thread the rings"" (TR) were achieved faster with RT than with CT despite crossover (p < 0.0001). An RT-favoring difference was observed in speed for both tasks when changing modality. Percentage improvement with increasing trials was similar for RT and CT: RT completion time averaged 39 seconds and 211 seconds (PP and TR, respectively), compared with 65 seconds and 362 seconds when using CT (p < 0.0001); final improvement averaged 26% and 46% for RT (PP and TR, respectively) vs 31% and 47% for CT (p was 0.76 for PP and 0.20 for TR). Within the PP task, RT times averaged 41 seconds without previous CT experience vs 35 seconds with previous CT experience (p = 0.20); CT times averaged 61 seconds without and 69 seconds with previous RT experience (p = 0.48). Comparable times for the TR task were 212 seconds vs 216 seconds (p = 0.66) and 388 seconds vs 334 seconds (p = 0.17). Both instrument collisions and excessive force occurred more commonly for RT than for CT within the TR task (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Speeds were faster overall with RT than with CT, but the percentage of speed improvement with trials was similar, suggesting similar learning curves, with minimal transfer effect appreciated. © 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States","Traveling waves in the developing brain are a prominent source of highly correlated spiking activity that may instruct the refinement of neural circuits. A candidate mechanism for mediating such refinement is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which translates correlated activity patterns into changes in synaptic strength. To assess the potential of these phenomena to build useful structure in developing neural circuits, we examined the interaction of wave activity with STDP rules in simple, biologically plausible models of spiking neurons. We derive an expression for the synaptic strength dynamics showing that, by mapping the time dependence of STDP into spatial interactions, traveling waves can build periodic synaptic connectivity patterns into feedforward circuits with a broad class of experimentally observed STDP rules. The spatial scale of the connectivity patterns increases with wave speed and STDP time constants. We verify these results with simulations and demonstrate their robustness to likely sources of noise. We show how this pattern formation ability, which is analogous to solutions of reaction-diffusion systems that have been widely applied to biological pattern formation, can be harnessed to instruct the refinement of postsynaptic receptive fields.

Recently it was shown that endogenous CEST contrasts can be strongly affected by the MT background, so corrections are needed to derive accurate estimates of CEST effects. Herein we show that a full analytical solution of the underlying Bloch-McConnell equations for both MT and CEST provides insights into their interaction and suggests a simple means to isolate their effects. The presented analytical solution, based on the eigenspace solution of the Bloch-McConnell equations, extends previous treatments by allowing arbitrary lineshapes for the semi-solid MT effects and simultaneously describing multiple CEST pools in the presence of a large MT pool for arbitrary irradiation. The structure of the model indicates that semi-solid MT and CEST effects basically add up inversely in determining the steady-state Z-spectrum, as previously shown for direct saturation and CEST effects. Implications for existing previous CEST analyses in the presence of a semi-solid MT are studied and discussed. It turns out that, to accurately quantify CEST contrast, a good reference Z-value, the observed longitudinal relaxation rate of water, and the semi-solid MT pool size fraction must all be known. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CEST; Chemical exchange saturation transfer; Creatine; Magnetization transfer; MT; Spillover effect; Spinlock","Chemical analysis; Irradiation; Lakes; Magnetization; Protons; Tissue; CEST; Chemical exchange saturation transfer; Creatine; Magnetization transfer; MT; Spillover effects; Spinlock; Saturation magnetization; proton; bovine serum albumin; creatine; water; analytic method; Article; chemical exchange saturation transfer; echo planar imaging; electron spin resonance; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; proton transport; semi solid magnetization transfer; steady state; animal; bovine; chemistry; computer simulation; imaging phantom; magnetism; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; theoretical model; Animals; Cattle; Computer Simulation; Creatine; Magnetic Phenomena; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Theoretical; Phantoms, Imaging; Protons; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921595505

Most fMRI acquisitions rely on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast employing T2* weighted 2D multi-slice echo-planar imaging (EPI). At ultra-high magnetic field (i.e. 7 T and above), it has been shown experimentally and by simulation, that T2 weighted acquisitions yield a signal that is spatially more specific to the site of neuronal activity at the cost of functional sensitivity. This study compared two T2 weighted imaging sequences, inner-volume 3D Gradient-and-Spin-Echo (3D-GRASE) and 2D Spin-Echo EPI (SE-EPI), with evaluation of their imaging point-spread function, functional specificity, and functional sensitivity at sub-millimeter resolution. Simulations and measurements of the imaging point-spread function revealed that the strongest anisotropic blurring in 3D-GRASE (along the second phase-encoding direction) was about 60 % higher than the strongest anisotropic blurring in 2D SE-EPI (along the phase-encoding direction). In a visual paradigm, the BOLD sensitivity of 3D-GRASE was found to be superior due to its higher temporal signal-to-noise ratio. High resolution cortical depth profiles suggested that the contrast mechanisms are similar between the two sequences, however, 2D SE-EPI had a higher surface bias owing to the higher T2* contribution of the longer in plane EPI echo-train for full field of view compared to the reduced field of view of zoomed 3D-GRASE. © 2015 Kemper, De_martino, Vu, Poser, Feinberg, Goebel and Yacoub.","3D-GRASE; High-resolution BOLD fMRI; Point-spread function; Spin-echo EPI; T2; T2*","adult; anisotropy; Article; artifact; BOLD signal; calcarine sulcus; comparative study; controlled study; echo planar imaging; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; gradient and spin echo planar imaging; gray matter; human; human experiment; image quality; magnetic field; male; modulation transfer function; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; signal noise ratio; simulation; three dimensional imaging; visual stimulation; white matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929150255

We present a model of cognitive cost based on the novel idea that the brain senses and plans for longer-term allocation of metabolic resources by purposively conserving brain activity. We identify several distinct ways the brain might control its metabolic output, and show how a control-theoretic model that models decision-making with an energy budget can explain cognitive effort avoidance in terms of an optimal allocation of limited energetic resources. The model accounts for both subject responsiveness to reward and the detrimental effects of hypoglycemia on cognitive function. A critical component of the model is using astrocytic glycogen as a plausible basis for limited energetic reserves. Glycogen acts as an energy buffer that can temporarily support high neural activity beyond the rate supported by blood glucose supply. The published dynamics of glycogen depletion and repletion are consonant with a broad array of phenomena associated with cognitive cost. Our model thus subsumes both the ""cost/benefit"" and ""limited resource"" models of cognitive cost while retaining valuable contributions of each. We discuss how the rational control of metabolic resources could underpin the control of attention, working memory, cognitive lookahead, model-free vs. model-based policy learning as well as the pattern of generalization of cognitive improvements due to video-game training experiments. © 2015 Christie and Schrater.","Cognitive control; Decision making; Energy; Glycogen; Mental effort; Optimal control","glucose; glycogen; Article; attention; brain function; brain metabolism; cognition; cognitive lookahead; decision making; energetic resource allocation; energy consumption; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; executive function; human; hypoglycemia; learning; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; reward; simulation; working memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938407171

Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities. © 2015 Sander et al.",,"Article; controlled study; food web; herbivore; herbivory; host parasite interaction; nonhuman; parasitoid; pollinator; population dynamics; population structure; species coexistence; symbiosis; animal; computer simulation; ecosystem; food chain; human; physiology; population dynamics; predation; species difference; statistical model; Animals; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Humans; Models, Statistical; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938634134

Integrating variable renewable energy sources into the transmission grid introduces challenges in real time power system operation. This causes power and frequency fluctuations and raises stability concerns. In this paper, a 200. MW photovoltaic (PV) plant is integrated into a two-area four-machine power system. In order to maintain the system frequency, a dynamic tie-line power flow control is implemented using predicted PV power as an input to the automatic generation controller in Area 1, which transfers power to Area 2 with PV generation. The prediction performances of two learning reservoir based networks, an echo state network (ESN) and an extreme learning machine (ELM), are investigated for day and night time operations. The experimental study is performed using actual weather data from Clemson, SC and a real time simulation of a utility-scale PV plant integrated power system. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are used to provide input signals to automatic generation controllers in the two area power system. Typical tie-line power flow control results based on ESN and ELM models are presented to show the impact of predicting PV power in improved automatic generation control with variable generation.

The new contrast regime is highlighted with numerical intravoxel simulations including the point-spread function for 3D half-echo acquisitions.

This study pilot tested the standardized clinician (SC) methodology, a novel adaptation of standardized patient methodology, for teaching patient engagement skills for the complex health care situation of transitioning from a hospital back to home. METHODS: Sixty-seven participants at heightened risk for hospitalization were randomly assigned to either simulation exposure-only or full-intervention group. Both groups participated in simulation scenarios with ""standardized clinicians"" around tasks related to hospital discharge and follow-up. The full-intervention group was also debriefed after scenario sets and learned about tools for actively participating in hospital-to-home transitions. Measures included changes in observed behaviors at baseline and follow-up and an overall program evaluation. RESULTS: The full-intervention group showed increases in observed tool possession (P = 0.014) and expression of their preferences and values (P = 0.043). The simulation exposure-only group showed improvement in worksheet scores (P = 0.002) and fewer engagement skills (P = 0.021). Both groups showed a decrease in telling an SC about their hospital admission (P < 0.05). Open-ended comments from the program evaluation were largely positive. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups benefited from exposure to the SC intervention. Program evaluation data suggest that simulation training is feasible and may provide a useful methodology for teaching patient skills for active engagement in health care. Future studies are warranted to determine if this methodology can be used to assess overall patient engagement and whether new patient learning transfers to health care encounters.

A key concept is that GABAergic activity can become excitatory if intraneuronal chloride rises. However, it has proved difficult to separate the role of raised chloride from other contributory factors in complex network phenomena, such as epileptic pathology. Therefore, we asked what patterns of activity are associated with chloride dysregulation by making novel use of Halorhodopsin to load clusters of mouse pyramidal cells artificially with Cl-. Brief (1–10 s) activation of Halorhodopsin caused substantial positive shifts in the GABAergic reversal potential that were proportional to the charge transfer during the illumination and in adult neocortical pyramidal neurons decayed with a time constant of τ = 8.0 ± 2.8s. At the network level, these positive shifts in EGABA produced a transient rise in network excitability, with many distinctive features of epileptic foci, including high-frequency oscillations with evidence of out-of-phase firing (Ibarz et al., 2010). We show how such firing patterns can arise from quite small shifts in the mean intracellular Cl- level, within heterogeneous neuronal populations. Notably, however, chloride loading by itself did not trigger full ictal events, even with additional electrical stimulation to the underlying white matter.

One critical step in elucidating this relationship is the identification of governing principles underlying the directionality of interactions between nodes. Here, we demonstrate such principles through analytical solutions based on the phase lead/lag relationships of general oscillator models in networks. We confirm analytical results with computational simulations using general model networks and anatomical brain networks, as well as high-density electroencephalography collected from humans in the conscious and anesthetized states. Analytical, computational, and empirical results demonstrate that network nodes with more connections (i.e., higher degrees) have larger amplitudes and are directional targets (phase lag) rather than sources (phase lead). The relationship of node degree and directionality therefore appears to be a fundamental property of networks, with direct applicability to brain function. These results provide a foundation for a principled understanding of information transfer across networks and also demonstrate that changes in directionality patterns across states of human consciousness are driven by alterations of brain network topology. © 2015 Moon et al.",,"anesthetic agent; anesthesiological procedure; Article; brain function; brain network; brain region; computer simulation; connectome; consciousness; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; electroencephalography; entropy; general anesthesia; human; human experiment; kernel method; magnetoencephalography; membrane structure; nerve cell network; normal human; oscillation; oscillator; symbolic transfer entropy; unconsciousness; adult; biological model; biology; brain; connectome; female; male; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; young adult; Adult; Brain; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Connectome; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929485234

Here we describe an interdisciplinary education project based on a simple computer model of the colors observed in the famous thermal pools of Yellowstone National Park in the northwestern United States. The primary wavelength-dependent parameters that determine the widely varying pool colors are the reflectance of the rocks or the microbial mats growing on the rocks beneath the water (the microbial mat color depends on water temperature) and optical absorption and scattering in the water. This paper introduces a teaching module based on a one-dimensional computer model that starts with measured reflectance spectra of the microbial mats and modifies the spectra with depth-dependent absorption and scattering in the water. This module is designed to be incorporated into a graduate course on remote sensing systems, in a section covering the propagation of light through air and water, although it could be adapted to a general university optics course. The module presents the basic 1-D radiative transfer equation relevant to this problem, and allows them to build their own simple model. Students can then simulate the colors that would be observed for different variations of the microbial mat reflectance spectrum, skylight spectrum, and water depth. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.","absorption; colors; Optics education; optics in nature; radiative transfer; scattering","Absorption; Color; Education; Education computing; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Lakes; Light absorption; Microorganisms; One dimensional; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Remote sensing; Scattering; Water absorption; Absorption and scatterings; Interdisciplinary education; Northwestern United States; Optics education; Propagation of lights; Radiative transfer equations; Remote sensing system; Yellowstone national parks; Teaching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963593839

This spike synchrony may occur by chance, based solely on the neurons’ fluctuating firing patterns, or it may occur too frequently to be explicable by chance alone. When spike synchrony above chances levels is present, it may subserve computation for a specific cognitive process, or it could be an irrelevant byproduct of such computation. Either way, spike synchrony is a feature of neural data that should be explained. A point process regression framework has been developed previously for this purpose, using generalized linear models (GLMs). In this framework, the observed number of synchronous spikes is compared to the number predicted by chance under varying assumptions about the factors that affect each of the individual neuron’s firing-rate functions. An important possible source of spike synchrony is network-wide oscillations, which may provide an essential mechanism of network information flow. To establish the statistical link between spike synchrony and network-wide oscillations, we have integrated oscillatory field potentials into our point process regression framework. We first extended a previously-published model of spike-field association and showed that we could recover phase relationships between oscillatory field potentials and firing rates. We then used this new framework to demonstrate the statistical relationship between oscillatory field potentials and spike synchrony in: 1) simulated neurons, 2) in vitro recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and 3) in vivo recordings of neocortical V4 neurons. Our results provide a rigorous method for establishing a statistical link between network oscillations and neural synchrony. © 2015 Zhou et al.",,"antidromic stimulation; Article; brain region; connectome; controlled study; electric potential; hippocampal CA1 region; in vitro study; local field potential; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nerve cell network; oscillation; oscillatory field potential; physical phenomena; prediction; process development; pyramidal nerve cell; spike synchrony; spike wave; statistical analysis; statistical model; action potential; animal; biological model; biological rhythm; cell culture; computer simulation; cortical synchronization; feedback system; human; male; mouse; nerve cell network; physiology; rhesus monkey; synaptic transmission; Action Potentials; Animals; Biological Clocks; Cells, Cultured; Computer Simulation; Cortical Synchronization; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Macaca mulatta; Male; Mice; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946056744

Piedras St., Fort Bliss, TX  79920, United States","Background Surgical education is evolving as work hour constraints limit the exposure of residents to the operating room. Potential consequences may include erosion of resident education and decreased quality of patient care. Surgical simulation training has become a focus of study in an effort to counter these challenges. Previous studies have validated the use of arthroscopic surgical simulation programs both in vitro and in vivo. However, no study has examined if the gains made by residents after a simulation program are retained after a period away from training. Methods In all, 17 orthopedic surgery residents were randomized into simulation or standard practice groups. All subjects were oriented to the arthroscopic simulator, a 14-point anatomic checklist, and Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET). The experimental group received 1 hour of simulation training whereas the control group had no additional training. All subjects performed a recorded, diagnostic arthroscopy intraoperatively. These videos were scored by 2 blinded, fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons and outcome measures were compared within and between the groups. After 1 year in which neither group had exposure to surgical simulation training, all residents were retested intraoperatively and scored in the exact same fashion. Individual surgical case logs were reviewed and surgical case volume was documented. Results There was no difference between the 2 groups after initial simulation testing and there was no correlation between case volume and initial scores. After training, the simulation group improved as compared with baseline in mean ASSET (p = 0.023) and mean time to completion (p = 0.01). After 1 year, there was no difference between the groups in any outcome measurements. Conclusion Although individual technical skills can be cultivated with surgical simulation training, these advancements can be lost without continued education. It is imperative that residency programs implement a simulation curriculum and continue to train throughout the academic year.","arthroscopy; Key Words simulation; shoulder; surgical training; transfer validity","arthroscope; Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool; Article; assessment of humans; controlled study; education program; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; orthopedic surgeon; outcome assessment; postgraduate education; priority journal; professional competence; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; reliability; shoulder arthroscopy; simulation training; simulator; single blind procedure; statistical significance; surgical training; arthroscopy; clinical competence; curriculum; education; medical education; shoulder; surgery; time factor; Arthroscopy; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Humans; Internship and Residency; Prospective Studies; Shoulder Joint; Simulation Training; Single-Blind Method; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940688705

Recent analyses of commuting patterns and travel behavior in high-income countries have led to the suggestion that these models are highly generalizable, and as a result, gravity and radiation models have become standard tools for describing population mobility dynamics for infectious disease epidemiology. Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa may not conform to these models, however; physical accessibility, availability of transport, and cost of travel between locations may be variable and severely constrained compared to high-income settings, informal labor movements rather than regular commuting patterns are often the norm, and the rise of mega-cities across the continent has important implications for travel between rural and urban areas. Here, we first review how infectious disease frameworks incorporate human mobility on different spatial scales and use anonymous mobile phone data from nearly 15 million individuals to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Kenyan population. We find that gravity and radiation models fail in systematic ways to capture human mobility measured by mobile phones; both severely overestimate the spatial spread of travel and perform poorly in rural areas, but each exhibits different characteristic patterns of failure with respect to routes and volumes of travel. Thus, infectious disease frameworks that rely on spatial interaction models are likely to misrepresent population dynamics important for the spread of disease in many African populations. © 2015 Wesolowski et al.",,"Article; epidemiological data; gravity model; human; interpersonal communication; Kenya; mobile phone; nonbiological model; population dispersal; population dynamics; radiation model; rural area; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; travel; validation study; Africa south of the Sahara; computer simulation; employment; epidemiology; population dynamics; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Africa South of the Sahara; Cell Phones; Computer Simulation; Employment; Humans; Models, Statistical; Population Dynamics; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Travel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938635450

For the auditory system, the FIR filter is instantiated in the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF), often in the framework of the generalized linear model. Despite widespread use of the FIR STRF, numerous formulations for linear filters are possible that require many fewer parameters, potentially permitting more efficient and accurate model estimates. To explore these alternative STRF architectures, we recorded single-unit neural activity from auditory cortex of awake ferrets during presentation of natural sound stimuli. We compared performance of > 1000 linear STRF architectures, evaluating their ability to predict neural responses to a novel natural stimulus. Many were able to outperform the FIR filter. Two basic constraints on the architecture lead to the improved performance: (1) factorization of the STRF matrix into a small number of spectral and temporal filters and (2) low-dimensional parameterization of the factorized filters. The best parameterized model was able to outperform the full FIR filter in both primary and secondary auditory cortex, despite requiring fewer than 30 parameters, about 10% of the number required by the FIR filter. After accounting for noise from finite data sampling, these STRFs were able to explain an average of 40% of A1 response variance. The simpler models permitted more straightforward interpretation of sensory tuning properties. They also showed greater benefit from incorporating nonlinear terms, such as short term plasticity, that provide theoretical advances over the linear model. Architectures that minimize parameter count while maintaining maximum predictive power provide insight into the essential degrees of freedom governing auditory cortical function. They also maximize statistical power available for characterizing additional nonlinear properties that limit current auditory models. © 2015 Thorson et al.",,"action potential; algorithm; animal; auditory cortex; auditory stimulation; biological model; computer simulation; hearing; Mustela putorius furo; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; sensory nerve cell; signal processing; Acoustic Stimulation; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Auditory Cortex; Auditory Perception; Computer Simulation; Ferrets; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Sensory Receptor Cells; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953302346

If prior knowledge, acquired from learning a set of objects is only transferable to new objects that share properties with the old, then the recognition system’s optimal organization must be one containing specialized modules for different object classes. Our analysis starts from a premise we call the invariance hypothesis: that the computational goal of the ventral stream is to compute an invariant-to-transformations and discriminative signature for recognition. The key condition enabling approximate transfer of invariance without sacrificing discriminability turns out to be that the learned and novel objects transform similarly. This implies that the optimal recognition system must contain subsystems trained only with data from similarly-transforming objects and suggests a novel interpretation of domain-specific regions like the fusiform face area (FFA). Furthermore, we can define an index of transformation-compatibility, computable from videos, that can be combined with information about the statistics of natural vision to yield predictions for which object categories ought to have domain-specific regions in agreement with the available data. The result is a unifying account linking the large literature on view-based recognition with the wealth of experimental evidence concerning domain-specific regions. © 2015 Leibo et al.",,"Article; brain region; controlled study; domain specific region; fusiform face area; hypothesis; mathematical computing; neuroanatomy; prediction; theoretical model; visual cortex; animal; biological model; computer simulation; human; nerve cell network; pattern recognition; physiology; recognition; visual cortex; visual system; Animals; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Recognition (Psychology); Visual Cortex; Visual Pathways",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946068475

Methods After obtaining institutional review board approval, fourth-year medical students, urology residents (postgraduate year 1-5), and staff attending surgeons from an academic institution were recruited. Participants were grouped by level of experience and evaluated on 4 different BLUS modules testing fundamental laparoscopic techniques from September 2012 to September 2013. Task completion time (TCT) and missed objectives were compared with previous laparoscopic experience, amount of endourological training, and scores obtained through the EDGE simulator. Results TCTs among the participants were slower and accrued greater errors in the novice group (n = 10) than in the intermediate-level (n = 9) and expert-level (n = 9) groups. Completion times on the peg transfer were 213.4, 128.1, and 108.7 seconds (p &lt; 0.05); on the circle cutting were 182.4, 128.3, and 97.2 seconds (p &lt; 0.05); on the clip application were 44.4, 43.2, and 38.1 seconds (p = 0.08); and on the suturing were 286.1, 177.3, and 123.6 seconds (p &lt; 0.05) for novice, intermediate, and expert groups, respectively. When past laparoscopic numbers of participants were compared with TCTs, a positive correlation of R2 = 0.39 was seen, signifying a relationship between number of laparoscopic cases and TCT outcomes.

Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that lactate produced in astrocytes (a type of glial cell) can also fuel neuronal activity. The quantitative aspects of this so-called astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) are still debated. To address this question, we developed a detailed biophysical model of the brain’s metabolic interactions. Our model integrates three modeling approaches, the Buxton-Wang model of vascular dynamics, the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of neuronal membrane excitability and a biophysical model of metabolic pathways. This approach provides a template for large-scale simulations of the neuron-glia-vasculature (NGV) ensemble, and for the first time integrates the respective timescales at which energy metabolism and neuronal excitability occur. The model is constrained by relative neuronal and astrocytic oxygen and glucose utilization, by the concentration of metabolites at rest and by the temporal dynamics of NADH upon activation. These constraints produced four observations. First, a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons emerged in response to activity. Second, constrained by activity-dependent NADH transients, neuronal oxidative metabolism increased first upon activation with a subsequent delayed astrocytic glycolysis increase. Third, the model correctly predicted the dynamics of extracellular lactate and oxygen as observed in vivo in rats. Fourth, the model correctly predicted the temporal dynamics of tissue lactate, of tissue glucose and oxygen consumption, and of the BOLD signal as reported in human studies. These findings not only support the ANLS hypothesis but also provide a quantitative mathematical description of the metabolic activation in neurons and glial cells, as well as of the macroscopic measurements obtained during brain imaging. © 2015 Jolivet et al.",,"glucose; lactic acid; oxygen; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; lactic acid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; sodium; aerobic metabolism; Article; astrocyte; biophysical model; BOLD signal; brain blood vessel; brain metabolism; energy metabolism; glia cell; glucose utilization; glycolysis; Hodgkin Huxley equation; in vivo study; mathematical model; metabolic activation; model; nerve cell; nerve cell excitability; nerve cell membrane; neuroimaging; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; rat; tissue level; animal; biological model; biology; brain; brain circulation; computer simulation; extracellular space; human; metabolism; nerve cell; vascularization; Rattus; Animals; Astrocytes; Brain; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Extracellular Space; Glucose; Humans; Lactic Acid; Models, Cardiovascular; Models, Neurological; NAD; Neurons; Oxygen Consumption; Rats; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924359074

To gain enough insights for actionable knowledge, the development of models and analysis of modeling results usually requires that models be run many times so that all possibilities can be covered. Central to the goal of our research is, therefore, the use of ensemble visualization of a large scale simulation space to appropriately aid decision makers in reasoning about infrastructure behaviors and vulnerabilities in support of critical infrastructure analysis. This requires the bringing together of computing-driven simulation results with the human decision-making process via interactive visual analysis. We have developed a general critical infrastructure simulation and analysis system for situationally aware emergency response during natural disasters. Our system demonstrates a scalable visual analytics infrastructure with mobile interface for analysis, visualization and interaction with large-scale simulation results in order to better understand their inherent structure and predictive capabilities. To generalize the mobile aspect, we introduce mobility as a design consideration for the system.

This approach employs 4n memristors and no switch for implementing an n-cell system in comparison with 2n2 memristors and 2n switches of a Cellular Memristive Dynamical System (CMDS). Moreover, this approach allows for dynamical variables with both analog and one-hot digital values opening a wide range of choices for interconnections and networking schemes. Dynamical response analyses show that this circuit exhibits various responses based on the underlying bifurcation scenarios which determine the main characteristics of the neuromorphic dynamical systems. Due to high programmability of the circuit, it can be applied to a variety of learning systems, real-time applications, and analytically indescribable dynamical systems.

The method is capable of learning multiple target spectral signatures from weakly- and inaccurately-labeled hyperspectral imagery. Multi-target eFUMI is a generalization of the Function of Multiple Instances approach (FUMI). The FUMI approach differs significantly from standard Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach in that it assumes each data is a function of target and non-target ""concepts."" In this paper, data points which are convex combinations of multiple target and several non-target ""concepts"" are considered. Moreover, it allows both ""proportion-level"" and ""bag-level"" uncertainties in training data. Training data needs only binary labels indicating whether some spatial area contains or does not contain some proportion of target; the specific target proportions for the training data are not needed. Multi-target eFUMI learns the target and non-target concepts, the number of non-target concepts, and the proportions of all the concepts for each data point. After learning the target concepts using the binary ""bag-level"" labeled training data, target detection can be performed on test data.

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a pragmatic CVC simulation program on procedural protocol adherence, technical skill, and patient outcomes. Methods: Internal medicine interns were randomized to standard training for CVC insertion or standard training plus simulation-based mastery training. Standard training involved a lecture, a video-based online module, and instruction by the supervising physician during actual CVC insertions. Intervention-group subjects additionally underwent supervised training on a venous access simulator until they demonstrated procedural competence. Raters evaluated interns' performance during internal jugular CVC placement on actual patients in the medical intensive care unit. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for outcome clustering within trainees. Results: We observed 52 interns placing 87 CVCs. Simulation-trained interns exhibited better adherence to prescribed procedural technique than interns who received only standard training (P = 0.024). There were no significant differences detected in first-attempt or overall cannulation success rates, mean needle passes, global assessment scores, or complication rates. Conclusions: Simulation training added to standard training improved protocol adherence during CVC insertion by novice practitioners. This study may have been too small to detect meaningful differences in venous cannulation proficiency and other clinical outcomes, highlighting the difficulty of patient-centered simulation research in settings where poor outcomes are rare. For high-performing systems, where protocol deviations may provide an important proxy for rare procedural complications, simulation may improve CVC insertion quality and safety.

The authors applied generalizability theory to examine reliability in an ambulatory care scenario using the following 2 trained observer groups: standardized patient (SP, actor) raters and those who received rater training alone (non-SPs). Methods Twenty-one graduate health professions students participated as health care providers in an interprofessional care simulation involving an SP, caregiver, and clinicians. Six observers in each group received frame-of-reference training and rated aspects of collaborative care using a behavioral observation checklist. The authors examined sources of measurement variance using generalizability theory and extended this technique to statistically compare the rater types and compute reliability for subsets of raters. Results Standardized patient ratings were significantly more reliable than non-SPs' despite both groups receiving extensive rater training. A single SP was predicted to generate scores with a reliability of 0.74, whereas a single non-SP rater's scores were predicted at a reliability of 0.40. Removing each rater one by one from the full 6-member SP sample reduced reliability similarly for all raters (reliability, 0.86-0.89). However, removing individual raters from the full 6-member non-SP sample led to more variable reductions in reliability (0.58-0.72). Conclusions Ongoing experience rating performance from within a particular simulation-based assessment may be a valuable rater characteristic and more effective than rater training alone. The extensions of reliability estimation introduced here can also be used to support more insightful reliability research and subsequent improvement of rater training and assessment protocols. © 2015 by the Society for Simulation in Healthcare.","Assessment; Interprofessional education; Medical simulation; Reliability","clinical competence; cooperation; education; human; medical profession; observer variation; patient care; public relations; reproducibility; simulation training; standards; Clinical Competence; Cooperative Behavior; Educational Measurement; Health Occupations; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Observer Variation; Patient Care Team; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939538430

However, the variants that reach statistical significance typically explain only a small fraction of the heritability. One explanation for the ""missing heritability"" is that there are many additional disease-associated common variants whose effects are too small to detect with current sample sizes. It therefore is useful to have methods to quantify the heritability due to common variation, without having to identify all causal variants. Recent studies applied restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation to case-control studies for diseases. Here, we show that REML considerably underestimates the fraction of heritability due to common variation in this setting. The degree of underestimation increases with the rarity of disease, the heritability of the disease, and the size of the sample. Instead, we develop a general framework for heritability estimation, called phenotype correlation-genotype correlation (PCGC) regression, which generalizes the well-known Haseman-Elston regression method. We show that PCGC regression yields unbiased estimates. Applying PCGC regression to six diseases, we estimate the proportion of the phenotypic variance due to common variants to range from 25%to 56%and the proportion of heritability due to common variants from 41% to 68% (mean 60%).

Prior to VR training, subjects performed 2 FLS tasks 3 times each (Peg Transfer, Intracorporeal Knot Tying) using the daVinci Surgical System™ docked to a video trainer box. Task performance for the FLS tasks was scored objectively. Subjects then practiced on the VR simulator (daVinci Skills Simulator) until proficiency levels on all 5 tasks were achieved before completing a post-training assessment of the 2 FLS tasks on the daVinci Surgical System™ in the video trainer box.Introduction: The clinical application of robotic surgery is increasing. The skills necessary to perform robotic surgery are unique from those required in open and laparoscopic surgery. A validated laparoscopic surgical skills curriculum (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery or FLS™) has transformed the way surgeons acquire laparoscopic skills. There is a need for a similar skills training and assessment tool for robotic surgery. Our research group previously developed and validated a robotic training curriculum in a virtual reality (VR) simulator. We hypothesized that novice robotic surgeons could achieve proficiency levels defined by more experienced robotic surgeons on the VR robotic curriculum, and that this would result in improved performance on the actual daVinci Surgical System™.Results: All subjects to complete the study (1 dropped out) reached proficiency levels on all VR tasks in an average of 71 (± 21.7) attempts, accumulating 164.3 (± 55.7) minutes of console training time. There was a significant improvement in performance on the robotic FLS tasks following completion of the VR training curriculum.Conclusions: Novice robotic surgeons are able to attain proficiency levels on a VR simulator. This leads to improved performance in the daVinci surgical platform on simulated tasks. Training to proficiency on a VR robotic surgery simulator is an efficient and viable method for acquiring robotic surgical skills. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery; Proficiency training; Robotic surgery; Simulation; Virtual reality","clinical competence; clinical trial; computer interface; computer simulation; curriculum; education; educational model; human; laparoscopy; medical education; medical student; procedures; robotics; task performance; United States; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Laparoscopy; Models, Educational; Robotics; Students, Medical; Task Performance and Analysis; United States; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931374502

To date, multi-core CPUs and also Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) have been used for highly intensive parallel computations. In this paper, we have compared multi-core and GPU implementations of an RTM based on the discrete ordinate solution method. To implement GPUs, the original CPU code has been redesigned using the C-oriented Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) developed by NVIDIA. GPU memory management is a crucial issue regarding the performance. To cope with limitations of GPU registers, we have adapted an RTM based on the matrix operator technique together with the interaction principle for multilayer atmospheric systems. The speed-up of such an implementation depends on the number of discrete ordinates used in the RTM. To reduce the CPU/GPU communication overhead, we have exploited the asynchronous data transfer between host and device. To obtain optimal performance, we have also used overlapping of CPU and GPU computations by distributing the workload between them. With GPUs, we have achieved a 20x-40x speed-up for the multi-stream RTM, and 50x speed-up for the two-stream RTM with respect to the original single-threaded CPU codes. Based on these performance tests, an optimal workload distribution scheme between GPU and CPU is proposed. Additionally, CPU/GPU benchmark tests regarding basic matrix operations are given. Finally, we discuss the performance obtained with the multi-core-CPU and GPU implementations of the RTM. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","CUDA; Discrete ordinate method; Radiative transfer models","Benchmarking; C (programming language); Computer simulation; Data transfer; Matrix algebra; Parallel architectures; Program processors; Remote sensing; Asynchronous data transfers; Communication overheads; Compute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA); CUDA; Discrete ordinate methods; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Matrix operator techniques; Radiative transfer model; Radiative transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027949444

The model describes known memristor dynamics even as it generates new insight about vacancy migration, bottlenecks to switching speed and elucidates subtle relationships between switching resistance range and device parameters. The model is shown to comply with Chua's generalized equations for the memristor. Independent experimental results are used throughout, to validate the insights obtained from the model.

Most methods used to date to improve depth detection of fluorescence information involve acquisition of multiple images, postprocessing of the data using a light propagation model, and are capable of providing either depth-sectioned or tomographic fluorescence information. We introduce a method, termed masked detection of structured illumination, that allows the enhancement of fluorescence imaging at depth without postprocessing. This method relies on the scanning of a collimated beam onto a turbid medium and the physical masking of the point spread function on the detection arm before acquisition on a CCD camera. By preferentially collecting diffuse photons at a chosen source-detector range, this method enhances fluorescence information at depth and has the potential to form images without postprocessing and in real time. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Depth-enhanced imaging; Diffuse optical imaging; Fluorescence imaging","CCD cameras; Optical transfer function; Collimated beams; Diffuse optical imaging; Diffuse photons; Enhanced fluorescence imaging; Fluorescence imaging; Imaging fluorescences; Living tissues; Structured illumination; Fluorescence; computer simulation; devices; fluorescence imaging; illumination; procedures; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging; Computer Simulation; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lighting; Optical Imaging; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910673497

A compact laparoscopic simulator was developed with the intention to create a technical skill evaluation system that resembles standardized testing to provide the user with real-time percentile scores in a variety of skill metrics. The calculation of percentiles is only accurate if the pool of scores resembles a specific distribution (e.g., normal or log-normal distribution). We hypothesize that the grading measures provided by the simulator will follow normal or log-normal distributions.Materials and Methods A total of 29 surgical trainees with varying levels of laparoscopic experience were surveyed regarding their current training, proficiencies, and experience with the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery curriculum and then asked to perform a standard peg-transfer task 5 times. A proprietary device placed along the trocars of a laparoscopic box trainer was used to gather data that, when subjected to unique algorithms, gave real-time, web-based feedback to trainees on the following metrics: volume of instrument use, economy of movement, angular instrument path, instrument rotation, bimanual coordination, smoothness, time to task completion, and depth perception. Numerical data were plotted on a frequency histogram. Minitab software was used to identify if individual metrics fit a standard distribution curve. Analysis of variance was used to differentiate among 3 established physician skill levels, as a means of assessing construct validity.Results In the goodness-of-fit tests performed, angular path, depth perception, rotation, and smoothness were found to best fit a log-normal distribution (p > 0.1). Bimanual coordination was found to fit a normal distribution (p ≥ 0.067). However, both normal and log-normal distributions were rejected (p ≤ 0.01) for the metrics of time, volume, and economy of movement. After separating participants into 3 groups based on level of experience with the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery curriculum, analysis of variance showed significant differences among all group means across the 5 metrics (i.e., angular path, depth perception, rotation, smoothness, and bimanual coordination; p ≤ 0.023).Conclusion A proprietary device provided quantitative assessment of laparoscopic skills, which can be used to differentiate among skill levels. Of the 8 tested metrics, 5 fit a normal or log-normal distribution, meaning the scores can statistically be ranked by percentile. Time, volume, and economy of movement did not fit desired distributions. The grading system proved to have construct validity, indicating it may be useful in the longitudinal assessment of laparoscopic skills of surgical trainees. © 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","FLS; laparoscopic simulation; motion analysis; surgical education; technical skills","algorithm; computer program; Conference Paper; construct validity; curriculum; depth perception; human; Internet; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopic surgical instrument; motor coordination; performance measurement system; personal experience; physician; pilot study; psychomotor performance; simulator; standard; surgical training; clinical competence; education; laparoscopy; procedures; program development; standards; Clinical Competence; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internet; Laparoscopy; Pilot Projects; Program Development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920142254

Virtual reality simulation has a great potential as a training and assessment tool of laparoscopic skills and can overcome some limitations of the FLS trainer. This study was carried out to assess the value of our Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST©) in the peg transfer task compared to the FLS trainer and its ability to differentiate performance between novice, intermediate, and expert groups. Methods: Thirty subjects were divided into three groups: novices (PGY1-2, n = 10), intermediates (PGY3-4, n = 10), and experts (PGY5, surgical fellows and attendings, n = 10). All subjects performed ten trials of the peg transfer task on each simulator. Assessment of laparoscopic performance was based on FLS scoring while a questionnaire was used for subjective evaluation. Results: The performance scores in the two simulators were correlated, though subjects performed significantly better in the FLS trainer. Experts performed better than novices only on the FLS trainer while no significant differences were observed between the other groups. Moreover, a significant learning effect was found on both trainers, with a greater improvement of performance on the VBLaST©. Finally, 82.6 % of the subjects preferred the FLS over the VBLaST© for surgical training which could be attributed to the novelty of the VR technology and existing deficiencies of the user interface for the VBLaST©. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the VBLaST© reproduced faithfully some aspects of the FLS peg transfer task (such as color, size, and shape of the peg board, etc.) while other aspects require additional development. Future improvement of the user interface and haptic feedback will enhance the value of the system as an alternative to the FLS as the standard training tool for laparoscopic surgery skills. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Force feedback; Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS); Surgical training; Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST); Virtual reality (VR)","adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; eye hand coordination; feedback system; female; health care personnel; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; psychomotor performance; questionnaire; surgical training; task performance; virtual basic laparoscopic surgical trainer; virtual reality; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; laparoscopy; middle aged; validation study; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Feedback; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936111555

Existing models of movement either pertain to overly coarse scales, simulate some aspects of movement but not others, or were designed specifically for populations in developed countries. Here, we propose a generalizable framework for simulating the locations that an individual visits, time allocation across those locations, and population-level variation therein. As a case study, we fit alternative models for each of five aspects of movement (number, distance from home and types of locations visited; frequency and duration of visits) to interview data from 157 residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru. Comparison of alternative models showed that location type and distance from home were significant determinants of the locations that individuals visited and how much time they spent there. We also found that for most locations, residents of two neighbourhoods displayed indistinguishable preferences for visiting locations at various distances, despite differing distributions of locations around those neighbourhoods. Finally, simulated patterns of time allocation matched the interview data in a number of ways, suggesting that our framework constitutes a sound basis for simulating fine-scale movement and for investigating factors that influence it. © 2014 The Authors.","Activity space; Agent-based model; Co-location and contact networks; Human mobility; Simulation; Synthetic population","Computational methods; Activity spaces; Agent-based model; Contact networks; Human mobility; Simulation; Synthetic populations; Computer simulation; Article; computer simulation; home; human; movement (physiology); neighborhood; Peru; recreation; time; urban area; urban population; city; geographic information system; geographic mapping; interview; motor activity; physiology; spatial behavior; theoretical model; Cities; Computer Simulation; Geographic Information Systems; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Models, Theoretical; Motor Activity; Peru; Spatial Behavior; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906995541

We developed a detailed model of the spinal circuitry plus musculoskeletal system (SC+MS) for the primate arm and investigated its role in sensorimotor control, learning and storing of movement repertoires. Approach. Recently developed models of spinal circuit connectivity, neurons and muscle force/energetics were integrated and in some cases refined to construct the most comprehensive model of the SC+MS to date. The SC+MS's potential contributions to center-out reaching movement were assessed by employing an extremely simple model of the brain that issued only step commands. Main results. The SC+MS was able to generate physiological muscle dynamics underlying reaching across different directions, distances, speeds, and even in the midst of strong dynamic perturbations (i.e. viscous curl field). For each task, there were many different combinations of brain inputs that generated physiological performance. Natural patterns of recruitment and low metabolic cost emerged for about half of the learning trials when a purely kinematic cost function was used and for all of the trials when an estimate of metabolic energy consumption was added to the cost function. Solutions for different tasks could be interpolated to generate intermediate movement and the range over which interpolation was successful was consistent with experimental reports. Significance. This is the first demonstration that a realistic model of the SC+MS is capable of generating the required dynamics of center-out reaching. The interpolability observed is important for the feasibility of storing motor programs in memory rather than computing them from internal models of the musculoskeletal plant. Successful interpolation of command programs required them to have similar muscle recruitment patterns, which are thought by many to arise from hard-wired muscle synergies rather than learned as in our model system. These properties of the SC+MS along with its tendency to generate energetically efficient solutions might usefully be employed by motor cortex to generate voluntary behaviors such as reaching to targets. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","motor control; motor learning; musculoskeletal system; reaching; spinal circutry","Cost functions; Costs; Energy utilization; Interpolation; Metabolism; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; Physiology; Timing circuits; Comprehensive model; Motor control; Motor learning; Muscle recruitment patterns; reaching; Reaching movements; Sensorimotor control; spinal circutry; Cost benefit analysis; Article; energy consumption; energy transfer; human; kinematics; learning; motor control; movement (physiology); muscle strength; musculoskeletal system; neurophysiological recruitment; primate; sensorimotor function; spinal cord nerve cell; task performance; action potential; arm; biological model; computer simulation; innervation; learning; movement (physiology); nerve cell; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; skeletal muscle; spinal cord; Action Potentials; Arm; Computer Simulation; Humans; Learning; Models, Neurological; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Spinal Cord",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907908973

Interpretation of these differences is complicated, however, by the presence of multiple sources of exchanging magnetization including amide, amine, and hydroxyl protons, asymmetric magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) from macromolecules, and various protons with resonances in the aliphatic spectral region. We report a study targeted at separating these components and identifying their relative contributions to contrast in glioma. Off-resonance z-spectra at several saturation powers and durations were obtained from 6 healthy controls and 8 patients with high grade glioma. Results indicate that broad macromolecular MTC in normal brain tissue is responsible for the majority of contrast with glioma. Amide exchange could be detected with lower saturation power than has previously been reported in glioma, but it was a weak signal source with no detectable contrast from normal brain tissue. At higher saturation powers, amine proton exchange was a major contributor to the observed signal but showed no significant difference from normal brain. Robust acquisition strategies that effectively isolate the contributions of broad macromolecular MTC asymmetry from amine exchange were demonstrated that may provide improved contrast between glioma and normal tissue. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","APT - amide proton transfer imaging; Brain tumors; CEST - chemical exchange saturation transfer; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Magnetization transfer asymmetry; MT, MTC - magnetization transfer contrast; NOE - nuclear overhauser effect; SAFARI - saturation with alternating frequency RF irradiation; Z-Spectroscopy","amide; proton; amide; adult; article; brain tissue; cancer grading; chemical exchange saturation; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; glioma; human; image analysis; image processing; image quality; male; neuroimaging; patient assessment; priority journal; process optimization; radiological parameters; sensitivity analysis; signal processing; spectroscopy; z spectroscopy; algorithm; brain; brain tumor; chemistry; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; glioma; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; Adult; Algorithms; Amides; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Computer Simulation; Diagnostic Imaging; Female; Glioma; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Protons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903515069

The dimensionality reduction approaches are a promising tool for this task. Many complex diseases exhibit composite syndromes required to be measured in a cluster of clinical traits with varying correlations and/or are inherently longitudinal in nature (changing over time and measured dynamically at multiple time points). A multivariate approach for detecting interactions is thus greatly needed on the purposes of handling a multifaceted phenotype and longitudinal data, as well as improving statistical power for multiple significance testing via a two-stage testing procedure that involves a multivariate analysis for grouped phenotypes followed by univariate analysis for the phenotypes in the significant group(s). In this article, we propose a multivariate extension of generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) based on multivariate generalized linear, multivariate quasi-likelihood and generalized estimating equations models. Simulations and real data analysis for the cohort from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment are performed to investigate the properties and performance of the proposed method, as compared with the univariate method.

One feature that has escaped extensive investigation is the silk-on-silk connection joints within spiderwebs, particularly from a structural mechanics perspective. We report a joint theoretical and computational analysis of an idealized silk-on-silk fibre junction. By modifying the theory of multiple peeling, we quantitatively compare the performance of the system while systematically increasing the rigidity of the anchor thread, by both scaling the stress-strain response and the introduction of an applied pre-strain. The results of our study indicate that compliance is a virtue - the more extensible the anchorage, the tougher and stronger the connection becomes. In consideration of the theoretical model, in comparison with rigid substrates, a compliant anchorage enormously increases the effective adhesion strength (work required to detach), independent of the adhered thread itself, attributed to a nonlinear alignment between thread and anchor (contact peeling angle). The results can direct novel engineering design principles to achieve possible load transfer from compliant fibre-to-fibre anchorages, be they silk-on-silk or another, as-yet undeveloped, system. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

How such coupling affects sensory representations and ultimately behavior remains unclear.Weinvestigated the role of neuronal coupling during visual processing using a realistic biophysical model of the vertical system (VS) cell network in the blow fly. These neurons are thought to encode the horizontal rotation axis during rapid free-flight maneuvers. Experimental findings suggest that neurons of theVSare strongly electrically coupled, and that several downstream neurons driving motor responses to ego-rotation receive inputs primarily from a small subset of VS cells. These downstream neurons must decode information about the axis of rotation from a partial readout of the VS population response. To investigate the role of coupling, we simulated the VS response to a variety of rotating visual scenes and computed optimal Bayesian estimates from the relevant subset of VS cells. Our analysis shows that coupling leads to near-optimal estimates from a subpopulation readout. In contrast, coupling between VS cells has no impact on the quality of encoding in the response of the full population. We conclude that coupling at one level of the fly visual system allows for near-optimal decoding from partial information at the subsequent, premotor level. Thus, electrical couplingmayprovide a general mechanism to achieve near-optimal information transfer from neuronal subpopulations across organisms and modalities. © 2014 the authors.","Fly; Gap junction; Motion detection; Tangential cells; Vision","fly; gap junction; motion detection; tangential cells; vision; Animals; Diptera; Flight, Animal; Models, Neurological; Orientation; Rotation; Sensory Receptor Cells; Visual Pathways",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906920603

Based on first principles, DEB theory is used to illuminate underlying physiological processes (maintenance, growth, development, and reproduction), thus providing a framework to predict individual-level responses to environmental change. We parameterized the model for P. ochraceus using both data from the literature and experiments conducted specifically for the DEB framework. We devoted special attention to the model's capacity to (1) describe growth trajectories at different life-stages, including pelagic larval and post-metamorphic phases, (2) simulate shrinkage when prey availability is insufficient to meet maintenance requirements, and (3) deal with the combined effects of changing body temperature and food supply. We further validated the model using an independent growth data set. Using standard statistics to compare model outputs with real data (e.g. Mean Absolute Percent Error, MAPE) we demonstrated that the model is capable of tracking P. ochraceus' growth in length at different life-stages (larvae: MAPE = 12.27%; post-metamorphic, MAPE = 9.22%), as well as quantifying reproductive output index. However, the model's skill dropped when trying to predict changes in body mass (MAPE = 24.59%), potentially because of the challenge of precisely anticipating spawning events. Interestingly, the model revealed that P. ochraceus reserves contribute little to total biomass, suggesting that animals draw energy from structure when food is limited. The latter appears to drive indeterminate growth dynamics in P. ochraceus. Individual-based mechanistic models, which can illuminate underlying physiological responses, offer a viable framework for forecasting population dynamics in the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus. The DEB model herein represents a critical step in that direction, especially in a period of increased anthropogenic pressure on natural systems and an observed recent decline in populations of this keystone species. © 2014 Monaco et al.",,"article; biomass; body growth; body mass; body size; body temperature; catering service; controlled study; dynamic energy budget; energy metabolism; energy transfer; environmental change; forecasting; human impact (environment); keystone species; life cycle stage; metamorphosis; nonhuman; pelagic larva; Pisaster ochraceus; population dynamics; predator; predator prey interaction; reproduction; spawning; starfish; starvation; temperature sensitivity; animal; biological model; energy metabolism; physiology; starfish; Animals; Biomass; Energy Metabolism; Food Supply; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Starfish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940299958

For example, in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), in addition to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thousands of neuroimaging and neuropsychological phenotypes as intermediate phenotypes for Alzheimer's disease, have been collected. Although some classic methods like MANOVA and newly proposed methods may be applied, they have their own limitations. For example, MANOVA cannot be applied to binary and other discrete traits. In addition, the relationships among these methods are not well understood. Importantly, since these tests are not data adaptive, depending on the unknown association patterns among multiple traits and between multiple traits and a locus, these tests may or may not be powerful. In this paper we propose a class of data-adaptive weights and the corresponding weighted tests in the general framework of generalized estimation equations (GEE). A highly adaptive test is proposed to select the most powerful one from this class of the weighted tests so that it can maintain high power across a wide range of situations. Our proposed tests are applicable to various types of traits with or without covariates. Importantly, we also analytically show relationships among some existing and our proposed tests, indicating that many existing tests are special cases of our proposed tests. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to compare and contrast the power properties of various existing and our new methods. Finally, we applied the methods to an ADNI dataset to illustrate the performance of the methods.

In order to achieve sufficient tracking accuracy, feed-forward control algorithms, which rely on estimations of upcoming heart motion, have been proposed in the literature. However, performance of these feed-forward motion control algorithms under heart rhythm variations is an important concern. In their past work, the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of a receding horizon model predictive control-based algorithm, which used generalized adaptive predictors, under constant and slowly varying heart rate conditions. This paper extends these studies to the case when the heart motion statistics change abruptly and significantly, such as during arrhythmias. A feasibility study is carried out to assess the motion tracking capabilities of the adaptive algorithms in the occurrence of arrhythmia during beating heart surgery. Specifically, the tracking performance of the algorithms is evaluated on prerecorded motion data, which is collected in vivo and includes heart rhythm irregularities. The algorithms are tested using both simulations and bench experiments on a three degree-of-freedom robotic test bed. They are also compared with a position-plus-derivative controller as well as a receding horizon model predictive controller that employs an extended Kalman filter algorithm for predicting future heart motion. © 2014 Tuna et al.",,"algorithm; animal experiment; article; artificial heart pacemaker; calf (bovine); computer simulation; coronary artery bypass graft; electrode; feasibility study; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium fibrillation; heart rate variability; heart rhythm; image analysis; image processing; left anterior descending coronary artery; motion analysis system; nonhuman; off pump surgery; positive feedback; prediction; robotics; spectrometry; artificial intelligence; computer assisted surgery; heart; heart arrhythmia; heart contraction; heart surgery; human; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; Algorithms; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Artificial Intelligence; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Computer Simulation; Heart; Humans; Myocardial Contraction; Robotics; Surgery, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904597337

The model accounted for a wide range of data on the mPFC. Nevertheless, numerous recent findings suggest that mPFC may signal predictions and prediction errors even when the predicted outcomes are not contingent on prior actions. Here we show that the existing PRO model can learn to predict outcomes in a general sense, and not only when the outcomes are contingent on actions. A series of simulations show how this generalized PRO model can account for an even broader range of findings in the mPFC, including human ERP, fMRI, and macaque single-unit data. The results suggest that the mPFC learns to predict salient events in general and provides a theoretical framework that links mPFC function to model-based reinforcement learning, Bayesian learning, and theories of cognitive control. © 2014 Alexander and Brown.","Anterior cingulate; Attention; Cognitive control; Medial prefrontal cortex; Reinforcement learning","Forecasting; Reinforcement learning; Anterior cingulate; Attention; Cognitive control; Computational neural models; Model-based reinforcement learning; Prediction errors; Prefrontal cortex; Theoretical framework; Computer simulation; article; Bayesian learning; brain function; cognition; conceptual framework; electroencephalography; evoked response; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; learning; mathematical computing; mathematical model; medial prefrontal cortex; mismatch negativity; nonhuman; predicted response outcome model; prediction; prefrontal cortex; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904216442

Often the areas to adapt and to monitor progress are selected a priori. Less explored, however, has been the notion of automatically emerging activation in a particular area or subregions within that area recruited above and beyond the rest of the brain. Likewise, the notion of evoking such a signal as an amodal, abstract one remaining robust across different sensory modalities could afford some exploration. Here we develop a simple binary control task in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) and use a Bayesian sparse probit classification algorithm to automatically uncover brain regional activity that maximizes task performance. We trained and tested 19 participants using the visual modality for instructions and feedback. Across training blocks we quantified coupling of the frontoparietal nodes and selective involvement of visual and auditory regions as a function of the real-time sensory feedback. The testing phase under both forms of sensory feedback revealed automatic recruitment of the prefrontal cortex with a parcellation of higher strength levels in Brodmann's areas 9, 10, and 11 significantly above those in other brain areas. We propose that the prefrontal signal may be a neural correlate of externally driven intended direction and discuss our results in the context of various aspects involved in the cognitive control of our thoughts. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.","Brain computer interface; Coadaptation; Intentional control; Prefrontal cortex; Volitional control","article; auditory cortex; brain computer interface; classification algorithm; electroencephalogram; executive function; eye tracking; human; latent period; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; sensory feedback; signal transduction; task performance; thinking; adult; brain computer interface; brain mapping; devices; electroencephalography; evoked auditory response; evoked visual response; female; learning; male; physiology; prefrontal cortex; procedures; Adult; Brain Mapping; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Male; Prefrontal Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903650291

One of the key assumptions in this domain of study is the universal uniformity of commute times. However, a true comparison of commute patterns has often been hindered by the intrinsic differences in data collection methods, which make observation from different countries potentially biased and unreliable. In the present work, we approach this problem through the use of mobile phone call detail records (CDRs), which offers a consistent method for investigating mobility patterns in wholly different parts of the world. We apply our analysis to a broad range of datasets, at both the country (Portugal, Ivory Coast, and Saudi Arabia), and city (Boston) scale. Additionally, we compare these results with those obtained from vehicle GPS traces in Milan. While different regions have some unique commute time characteristics, we show that the home-work time distributions and average values within a single region are indeed largely independent of commute distance or country (Portugal, Ivory Coast, and Boston)-despite substantial spatial and infrastructural differences. Furthermore, our comparative analysis demonstrates that such distance-independence holds true only if we consider multimodal commute behaviors-as consistent with previous studies. In car-only (Milan GPS traces) and car-heavy (Saudi Arabia) commute datasets, we see that commute time is indeed influenced by commute distance. Finally, we put forth a testable hypothesis and suggest ways for future work to make more accurate and generalizable statements about human commute behaviors. © 2014 Kung et al.",,"article; comparative study; controlled study; Cote d'Ivoire; global positioning system; home work commuting; human; information processing; Italy; methodology; mobile phone; Portugal; rural area; Saudi Arabia; social behavior; time; traffic and transport; travel; United States; urban area; biological model; computer simulation; factual database; motor vehicle; traffic and transport; Boston; Cell Phones; Computer Simulation; Cote d'Ivoire; Databases, Factual; Humans; Italy; Models, Biological; Motor Vehicles; Portugal; Saudi Arabia; Time; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903147238

Thus there is a growing need for interventions that facilitate motor learning during rehabilitation therapy, to optimize recovery. D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist that enhances neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system (Ressler KJ, Rothbaum BO, Tannenbaum L, Anderson P, Graap K, Zimand E, Hodges L, Davis M. Arch Gen Psychiatry 61: 1136-1144, 2004), has been shown to facilitate declarative and emotional learning. We therefore tested whether combining DCS with motor training facilitates motor learning after stroke in a series of two experiments. Forty-one healthy adults participated in experiment I, and twenty adults with stroke participated in experiment II of this two-session, double-blind study. Session one consisted of baseline assessment, subject randomization, and oral administration of DCS or placebo (250 mg). Subjects then participated in training on a balancing task, a simulated feeding task, and a cognitive task. Subjects returned 1-3 days later for posttest assessment. We found that all subjects had improved performance from pretest to posttest on the balancing task, the simulated feeding task, and the cognitive task. Subjects who were given DCS before motor training, however, did not show enhanced learning on the balancing task, the simulated feeding task, or the associative recognition task compared with subjects given placebo. Moreover, training on the balancing task did not generalize to a similar, untrained balance task. Our findings suggest that DCS does not enhance motor learning or motor skill generalization in neurologically intact adults or in adults with stroke. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.","Behavioral training; D-cycloserine; Motor learning; Stroke","cycloserine; placebo; amino acid receptor blocking agent; cycloserine; adult; article; artificial feeding; body equilibrium; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cognition; cognitive rehabilitation; controlled study; disease simulation; double blind procedure; drug treatment failure; female; human; learning; locomotion; male; monotherapy; motor learning; motor performance; pretest posttest control group design; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; task performance; drug effects; feeding behavior; kinesiotherapy; learning; motor activity; neuropsychological test; physiology; Stroke; Adult; Cognition; Cycloserine; Double-Blind Method; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; Exercise Therapy; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motor Activity; Neuropsychological Tests; Postural Balance; Stroke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902682906

An important issue in eQTL mapping is how to effectively integrate networks representing interactions among genetic markers and genes. Recently, several Lasso-based methods have been proposed to leverage such network information. Despite their success, existing methods have three common limitations: (i) a preprocessing step is usually needed to cluster the networks; (ii) the incompleteness of the networks and the noise in them are not considered; (iii) other available information, such as location of genetic markers and pathway information are not integrated. Results: To address the limitations of the existing methods, we propose Graph-regularized Dual Lasso (GDL), a robust approach for eQTL mapping. GDL integrates the correlation structures among genetic markers and traits simultaneously. It also takes into account the incompleteness of the networks and is robust to the noise. GDL utilizes graph-based regularizers to model the prior networks and does not require an explicit clustering step. Moreover, it enables further refinement of the partial and noisy networks. We further generalize GDL to incorporate the location of genetic makers and gene-pathway information. We perform extensive experimental evaluations using both simulated and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively integrate various available priori knowledge and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art eQTL mapping methods. © 2014 The Author.

Blended particle filters that capture non-Gaussian features in an adaptively evolving low-dimensional subspace through particles interacting with evolving Gaussian statistics on the remaining portion of phase space are introduced here. These blended particle filters are constructed in this paper through a mathematical formalism involving conditional Gaussian mixtures combined with statistically nonlinear forecast models compatible with this structure developed recently with high skill for uncertainty quantification. Stringent test cases for filtering involving the 40-dimen-sional Lorenz 96 model with a 5-dimensional adaptive subspace for nonlinear blended filtering in various turbulent regimes with at least nine positive Lyapunov exponents are used here. These cases demonstrate the high skill of the blended particle filter algorithms in capturing both highly non-Gaussian dynamical features as well as crucial nonlinear statistics for accurate filtering in extreme filtering regimes with sparse infrequent high-quality observations. The formalism developed here is also useful for multiscale filtering of turbulent systems and a simple application is sketched below.","Curse of dimensionality; Hybrid methods","algorithm; article; blended particle filter; chaotic dynamics; energy transfer; entropy; filter; Monte Carlo method; nonlinear system; normal distribution; priority journal; statistics; curse of dimensionality; hybrid methods; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Information Science; Models, Theoretical; Nonlinear Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901684077

Here we assess the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on the Pacific storm track, using a multiscale global aerosol-climate model (GCM). Simulations of two aerosol scenarios corresponding to the present day and preindustrial conditions reveal long-range transport of anthropogenic aerosols across the north Pacific and large resulting changes in the aerosol optical depth, cloud droplet number concentration, and cloud and ice water paths. Shortwave and longwave cloud radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere are changed by-2.5 and +1.3 W m-2, respectively, by emission changes from preindustrial to present day, and an increased cloud top height indicates invigorated midlatitude cyclones. The overall increased precipitation and poleward heat transport reflect intensification of the Pacific storm track by anthropogenic aerosols. Hence, this work provides, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, a global perspective of the effects of Asian pollution outflows from GCMs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the multiscale modeling framework is essential in producing the aerosol invigoration effect of deep convective clouds on a global scale.","Aerosol-cloud-climate interaction; Convective storms, cloud invigoration","black carbon; ice; organic carbon; water; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; article; Asian; Atlantic islands; atmosphere; cloud; global aerosol climate model; heat; heat transfer; hurricane; model; Pacific islands; physical parameters; precipitation; priority journal; simulation; water content; aerosol-cloud-climate interaction; convective storms, cloud invigoration; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Asia; Atmosphere; Climate; Cyclonic Storms; Humans; Industry; Models, Theoretical; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900497574

This study used both weight drop in mice and fluid percussion injury in rats. These were chosen to simulate either mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). For mice, we used novel object recognition and the Y maze. For rats, we used the Morris water maze. NAC was administered beginning 30-60 minutes after injury.

The resulting [Ca2+] i accumulation further enhances Ca2+-induced Ca 2+ release, generating the positive inotropic effect. However, cardiac glycosides have some toxic and side effects such as arrhythmogenesis, confining their extensive clinical applications. The mechanisms underlying the proarrhythmic effect of glycosides are not fully understood. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which glycosides could cause cardiac arrhythmias via impairing mitochondrial energetics using an integrative computational cardiomyocyte model. In the simulations, the effect of glycosides was mimicked by blocking NKA activity. Results showed that inhibiting NKA not only impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ retention (thus suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging) but also enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (thus increased ROS production) during the transition of increasing workload, causing oxidative stress. Moreover, concurrent blocking of mitochondrial Na+/Ca 2+ exchanger, but not enhancing of Ca2+ uniporter, alleviated the adverse effects of NKA inhibition. Intriguingly, NKA inhibition elicited Ca2+ transient and action potential alternans under more stressed conditions such as severe ATP depletion, augmenting its proarrhythmic effect. This computational study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiac glycoside-induced arrhythmogenesis. The findings suggest that targeting both ion handling and mitochondria could be a very promising strategy to develop new glycoside-based therapies in the treatment of heart failure. © 2014 Li et al.",,"adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); calcium ion; cardiac glycoside; sodium calcium exchange protein; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); adenosine triphosphate; antioxidant; calcium; ion; reactive oxygen metabolite; action potential; animal cell; antiarrhythmic activity; arrhythmogenesis; article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme metabolism; guinea pig; heart automaticity; heart muscle cell; mitochondrial energy transfer; nonhuman; oxidative stress; workload; animal; computer simulation; cytology; enzymology; heart arrhythmia; homeostasis; membrane potential; metabolism; mitochondrion; oxidative phosphorylation; Action Potentials; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Antioxidants; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Calcium; Computer Simulation; Guinea Pigs; Homeostasis; Ions; Membrane Potentials; Mitochondria; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899570545

However, a single extreme learning machine is unstable in data classification. To overcome this drawback, more and more researchers consider using ensemble of ELMs. This paper proposes a method integrating voting-based extreme learning machines (V-ELMs) with dissimilarity (D-ELM). First, based on different dissimilarity measures, we remove a number of ELMs from the ensemble pool. Then, the remaining ELMs are grouped as an ensemble classifier by majority voting. Finally we use disagreement measure and double-fault measure to validate the D-ELM. The theoretical analysis and experimental results on gene expression data demonstrate that (1) the D-ELM can achieve better classification accuracy with less number of ELMs; (2) the double-fault measure based D-ELM (DF-D-ELM) performs better than disagreement measure based D-ELM (D-D-ELM). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Dissimilarity ensemble; Double-fault measure; Extreme learning machine; Gene expression data; Majority voting","Dissimilarity ensemble; Double-fault measure; Extreme learning machine; Gene Expression Data; Majority voting; Gene expression; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Classification (of information); accuracy; algorithm; article; Bagging algorithm; classification; classification accuracy; classifier; comparative study; computer simulation; controlled study; data classification; data processing; disagreement measure dissimilarity ensemble of extreme learning machine algorithm; double fault measure dissimilarity ensemble of extreme learning machine algorithm; gene expression; genetic database; learning algorithm; machine learning; priority journal; Random Forest algorithm; validation process; voting based extreme learning machine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893651131

Because of the bioinspired geometries, stress wave mitigation became apparent in a nonintuitive manner such that potential real-world applications in human protective gear designs are realizable. In nature, there are several toroidal designs that are employed for mitigating stress waves; examples include the hyoid bone on the back of a woodpecker's jaw that extends around the skull to its nose and a ram's horn. This study evaluates four different geometries with the same length and same initial cross-sectional diameter at the impact location in three-dimensional finite element analyses. The geometries in increasing complexity were the following: (1) a round cylinder, (2) a round cylinder that was tapered to a point, (3) a round cylinder that was spiraled in a two dimensional plane, and (4) a round cylinder that was tapered and spiraled in a two-dimensional plane. The results show that the tapered spiral geometry mitigated the greatest amount of pressure and impulse (approximately 98% mitigation) when compared to the cylinder regardless of material type (elastic, plastic, and viscoelastic) and regardless of input pressure signature. The specimen taper effectively mitigated the stress wave as a result of uniaxial deformational processes and an induced shear that arose from its geometry. Due to the decreasing cross-sectional area arising from the taper, the local uniaxial and shear stresses increased along the specimen length. The spiral induced even greater shear stresses that help mitigate the stress wave and also induced transverse displacements at the tip such that minimal wave reflections occurred. This phenomenon arose although only longitudinal waves were introduced as the initial boundary condition (BC). In nature, when shearing occurs within or between materials (friction), dissipation usually results helping the mitigation of the stress wave and is illustrated in this study with the taper and spiral geometries. The combined taper and spiral optimized stress wave mitigation in terms of the pressure and impulse; thus providing insight into the ram's horn design and woodpecker hyoid designs found in nature. © 2014 by ASME.","bioinspired design; dispersion in waveguides; elastic wave interaction and reflection; finite element analysis; geometric effects; guided wave propagation; stress wave mitigation","Bio-inspired designs; Finite element simulations; Geometric effects; Stress wave; Stress wave propagation; Three dimensional finite element analysis; Transverse displacements; Wave interactions; Cylinders (shapes); Design; Dispersions; Elastic waves; Finite element method; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Shear stress; Two dimensional; Viscoelasticity; Geometry; plastic; polycarbonate; viscoelastic substance; article; comparative study; controlled study; dispersion; energy; finite element analysis; geometry; hydrostatic pressure; pressure; shear stress; shock wave; stress; animal; biological model; compressive strength; computer simulation; energy transfer; human; mechanical stress; physiology; radiation scattering; shear strength; sound; tensile strength; vibration; viscosity; Young modulus; Animals; Compressive Strength; Computer Simulation; Elastic Modulus; Energy Transfer; Humans; Models, Biological; Pressure; Scattering, Radiation; Shear Strength; Sound; Stress, Mechanical; Tensile Strength; Vibration; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896791485

Recently, it has been shown that spatial maps of frequency can be used to quantify local susceptibility if the contributions of surrounding tissue can be deconvolved. Currently, such quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) methods employ gradient recalled echo (GRE) imaging to measure spatial differences in the signal phase evolution as a function of echo time, from which frequencies can be deduced. Analysis of these phase images, however, is complicated by phase wraps, despite the availability and usage of various phase unwrapping algorithms. In addition, lengthy high-resolution GRE scanning often heats the magnet bore, causing the magnetic field to drift over several Hertz, which is on the order of the frequency differences between tissues. Here, we explore the feasibility of applying the WAter Saturation Shift Referencing (WASSR) method for 3D whole brain susceptibility imaging. WASSR uses direct saturation of water protons as a function of frequency irradiation offset to generate frequency maps without phase wraps, which can be combined with any image or spectroscopy acquisition. By utilizing a series of fast short-echo-time direct saturation images with multiple radiofrequency offsets, a frequency correction for field drift can be applied based on the individual image phases. Regions of interest were delineated with an automated atlas-based method, and the average magnetic susceptibilities calculated from frequency maps obtained from WASSR correlated well with those from the phase-based multi-echo GRE approach at 3.

We propose an approximation to the likelihood of a point-process model of neurons that holds under assumptions about the continuous time process that are physiologically reasonable for neural spike trains: the presence of a refractory period, the predictability of the conditional intensity function, and its integrability. These are properties that apply to a large class of point processes arising in applications other than neuroscience. The proposed approach has several advantages over conventional ones. In particular, one can use standard fitting procedures for generalized linear models based on iteratively reweighted least squares while improving the accuracy of the approximation to the likelihood and reducing bias in the estimation of the parameters of the underlying continuous-time model. As a result, the proposed approach can use a larger bin size to achieve the same accuracy as conventional approaches would with a smaller bin size. This is particularly important when analyzing neural data with high mean and instantaneous firing rates. We demonstrate these claims on simulated and real neural spiking activity. By allowing a substantive increase in the required bin size, our algorithm has the potential to lower the barrier to the use of point-process methods in an increasing number of applications. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"action potential; article; biological model; physiology; refractory period; statistical model; Action Potentials; Likelihood Functions; Models, Neurological; Refractory Period, Electrophysiological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892984756

Such cross-scale causation presents a major challenge for developing a general understanding of how local decision-making shapes land-use changes at the global scale. This paper implements a generalized agent-based model (ABM) as a virtual laboratory to explore how global and local processes influence the land-use and livelihood decisions of local land-users, operationalized as settlement-level agents, across the landscapes of six real-world test sites. Test sites were chosen in USA, Laos, and China to capture globally-significant variation in population density, market influence, and environmental conditions, with land systems ranging from swidden to commercial agriculture. Publicly available global data were integrated into the ABM to model cross-scale effects of economic globalization on local land-use decisions. A suite of statistics was developed to assess the accuracy of model-predicted land-use outcomes relative to observed and random (i.e. null model) landscapes. At four of six sites, where environmental and demographic forces were important constraints on land-use choices, modeled land-use outcomes were more similar to those observed across sites than the null model. At the two sites in which market forces significantly influenced land-use and livelihood decisions, the model was a poorer predictor of land-use outcomes than the null model. Model successes and failures in simulating real-world land-use patterns enabled the testing of hypotheses on land-use decision-making and yielded insights on the importance of missing mechanisms. The virtual laboratory approach provides a practical framework for systematic improvement of both theory and predictive skill in land change science based on a continual process of experimentation and model enhancement. © 2014 Magliocca et al.",,"accuracy; agriculture; article; China; decision making; economic aspect; environment; land use; landscape; Laos; outcome assessment; population density; simulation; United States; Agriculture; China; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Environment; Humans; Internationality; Laos; Models, Statistical; Population Density; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900434351

However, the impact of VR simulation training on transfer of skills related to laparoscopic colectomy remains not investigated. The present study aimed at determining the impact of VR simulation warm-up on performance during laparoscopic colectomy in the porcine model. Methods: Fourteen residents naive to laparoscopic colectomy as surgeons were randomly assigned in block to two groups. Seven trainees completed a 2-h VR simulator training in the laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy module (study group). The remaining seven surgeons (control group) underwent no intervention. On the same day, all participants performed a sigmoid colectomy with anastomosis on a pig. All operations were video recorded. Two board-certified expert colorectal surgeons independently assessed performance during the colectomy on the swine. Examiners were blinded to group assignment. The two examiners used a previously validated clinical instrument specific to laparoscopic colectomy. The primary outcome was the generic and specific skills score values. Results: Surgeons undergoing short-duration training on the VR simulator performed significantly better during laparoscopic colectomy on the pig regarding general and specific technical skills evaluation. The average score of generic skills was 17.2 (16.5-18) for the control group and 20.1 (16.5-22) for the study group (p = 0.002). The specific skills average score for the control group was 20.2 (19-21.5) and 24.2 (21-27.5) for the study group (p = 0.001). There was acceptable concordance (Kendall's W) regarding the video assessment of generic (W = 0.78) and specific skills (W = 0.84) between the two examiners.

We consequently are now able to study the interaction of system latency and movement difficulty in a highly generalized way in a virtual telerobotic environment using wide variety of conditions and targets. Our targets are located on a spherical shell near our participants' starting point in a high dynamic fidelity virtual environment. Analysis of participants' ability to make movements to these targets has revealed a purely multiplicative interaction between control latency and task difficulty. Interestingly, we show that this the observed interaction supports work on Fitts' Law by E.R. Hoffmann and that it depends upon accounting for an internal human processing latency of ∼250 ms. Our data suggest that the interaction varies nonlinearly due to task difficulty in a manner consistent with Hoffmann's results. We propose a descriptive equation to reflect the observed interaction that can be seen as a spatiotemporal generalization of Fitts' Law.

The visual and cognitive mechanisms underlying such action discriminations are not well understood, especially in nonhuman animals. To identify the visual bases of action discriminations, four pigeons were tested in a go/no-go procedure to examine the contribution of different visual features in a discrimination of walking and running actions by different digital animal models. Two different tests with point-light displays derived from studies of human biological motion failed to support transfer of the learned action discrimination from fully figured models. Tests with silhouettes, contours, and the selective deletion or occlusion of different parts of the models indicated that information about the global motions of the entire model was critical to the discrimination. This outcome, along with earlier results, suggests that the pigeons' discrimination of these locomotive actions involved a generalized categorization of the sequence of configural poses. Because the motor systems for locomotion and flying in pigeons share little in common with quadruped motions, the pigeons' discrimination of these behaviors creates problems for motor theories of action recognition based on mirror neurons or related notions of embodied cognition. It suggests instead that more general motion and shape mechanisms are sufficient for making such discriminations, at least in birds. © 2014 ARVO.","Action recognition; Biological motion; Global perception; Occlusion; Pigeon","action recognition; animal; article; biological motion; computer simulation; discrimination learning; global perception; male; movement perception; occlusion; pattern recognition; physiology; pigeon; pigeons and doves; action recognition; biological motion; global perception; occlusion; pigeon; Animals; Columbidae; Computer Simulation; Discrimination Learning; Form Perception; Male; Motion Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901843066

The appropriateness of determining external validity measures has been debated, and it is known that external validity is not a necessary component in research if those findings do not need to transfer outside of that context; however, results in the transportation safety community are frequently generalized, if improperly, to a stated risk in public driving situations. Few studies have validated driving behavior between experimental and non-experimental (observed behavior in public) settings. Proposed is an empirical method to establish a baseline of non-experimental driving behaviors to compare with experimental driving behaviors. This method involves video recording public driving behaviors during the same time interval that data collection occurs in the real world (instrumented vehicle) and virtual world (driving simulator). These video recorded non-experimental driving behaviors at locations along an experimental route can then be compared to experimental driving behaviors in instrumented vehicles and driving simulator scenarios (if developed) to establish empirical differences and potentially contribute to measures of external validity. This method introduces collecting non-experimental driving behavior in order to establish methods that will generalize experimental results as they relate to public driving situations.

This article reports two experiments testing people's ability to learn new relational categories as a function of their relational structure. In Experiment 1, each stimulus consisted of 4 objects varying on 2 dimensions. Each category was defined by two binary relations between pairs of objects. The manner in which the relations were linked (i.e., by operating on shared objects) varied between subjects, producing 3 logically different conditions. In Experiment 2, each stimulus consisted of 4 objects varying on 3 dimensions. Categories were defined by three binary relations, leading to six logically different conditions. Various learning models were compared to the behavioral data, based on the theory of schema refinement. The results highlight several shortcomings of schema refinement as a model of relational learning: (1) it can make unreasonable demands on working memory, (2) it does not allow schemas to grow in complexity, and (3) it incorrectly predicts learning is insensitive to relational structure. We propose schema elaboration as an additional mechanism that provides a more complete account, and we relate this mechanism to previous proposals regarding interactions between analogy and representation construction.

Work-hour restrictions were implemented, among other reasons, to ensure enough sleep time for residents. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of sleep time, perceived fatigue, and experience on surgical performance. We hypothesized that performance would decrease with less sleep and fatigue, and that experienced surgeons would perform better than less experienced surgeons despite sleep deprivation and fatigue. Methods: Twenty-two surgical residents and attendings performed a peg transfer task on two simulators: the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS) trainer and the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST©), a virtual version of the FLS. Participants also completed questionnaires to assess their fatigue level and recent sleep hours. Each subject performed ten trials on each simulator in a counterbalanced order. Performance was measured using the FLS normalized scores and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Results: The multiple regression analysis showed that sleep hours and perceived fatigue were not covariates. No correlation was found between experience level and sleep hours or fatigue. Sleep hours and fatigue did not appear to affect performance. Expertise level was the only significant determinant of performance in both FLS and VBLaST©. Conclusions: Restricting resident work hours was expected to result in less fatigue and better clinical performance. In our study, peg transfer task performance was not affected by sleep hours. Experience level was a significant indicator of performance. Further examination of the complex relationship between sleep hour, fatigue, and clinical performance is needed to support the practice of work-hour restriction for surgical residents. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Fatigue; Performance; Simulation; Work-hour restrictions","adult; article; fatigue; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; performance; priority journal; questionnaire; residency education; resident; scoring system; simulator; sleep deprivation; sleep time; surgeon; surgical training; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; fatigue; laparoscopy; middle aged; physiology; procedures; psychology; regression analysis; sleep; task performance; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Sleep; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906935275

We have used single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to probe the temperature-induced chain collapse of five unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. Because this behavior is sensitive to the details of intrachain and chain-solvent interactions, the collapse allows us to probe the physical interactions governing the dimensions of disordered proteins. We find that each of the proteins undergoes a collapse with increasing temperature, with the most hydrophobic one, λ-repressor, undergoing a reexpansion at the highest temperatures. Although such a collapse might be expected due to the temperature dependence of the classical hydrophobic effect, remarkably we find that the largest collapse occurs for the most hydrophilic, charged sequences. Using a combination of theory and simulation, we show that this result can be rationalized in terms of the temperature-dependent solvation free energies of the constituent amino acids, with the solvation properties of the most hydrophilic residues playing a large part in determining the collapse.","ABSINTH; Cold shock protein; HIV integrase; Prothymosin α; Sanchez theory","intrinsically disordered protein; article; energy transfer; hydrophobicity; molecule; priority journal; protein protein interaction; repressor gene; solvation; temperature dependence; ABSINTH; cold shock protein; HIV integrase; prothymosin α; Sanchez theory; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Protein Conformation; Protein Unfolding; Solubility; Temperature; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898039764

Such behavioral feedback is particularly important in navigation. Successful navigation relies on proper coupling between sensors, which gather information during motion, and actuators, which control behavior. Because reorientation conditions future inputs, behavioral feedback can place sensors and actuators in an operational regime different from the resting state. How then can organisms maintain proper information transfer through the pathway while navigating diverse environments? In bacterial chemotaxis, robust performance is often attributed to the zero integral feedback control of the sensor, which guarantees that activity returns to resting state when the input remains constant. While this property provides sensitivity over a wide range of signal intensities, it remains unclear how other parameters such as adaptation rate and adapted activity affect chemotactic performance, especially when considering that the swimming behavior of the cell determines the input signal. We examine this issue using analytical models and simulations that incorporate recent experimental evidences about behavioral feedback and flagellar motor adaptation. By focusing on how sensory information carried by the response regulator is best utilized by the motor, we identify an operational regime that maximizes drift velocity along chemical concentration gradients for a wide range of environments and sensor adaptation rates. This optimal regime is outside the dynamic range of the motor response, but maximizes the contrast between run duration up and down gradients. In steep gradients, the feedback from chemotactic drift can push the system through a bifurcation. This creates a non-chemotactic state that traps cells unless the motor is allowed to adapt. Although motor adaptation helps, we find that as the strength of the feedback increases individual phenotypes cannot maintain the optimal operational regime in all environments, suggesting that diversity could be beneficial. © 2014 Dufour et al.",,"adaptation; article; bacterial chemotaxis; bacterial phenomena and functions; chemotaxis; concentration (parameters); dynamics; feedback system; flagellum; mathematical model; sensor; simulation; biological model; biology; chemotaxis; Escherichia coli; feedback system; phenotype; physiology; signal transduction; bacterial protein; membrane protein; methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins; Bacterial Proteins; Chemotaxis; Computational Biology; Escherichia coli; Feedback, Physiological; Membrane Proteins; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903388915

There is a need for a systematic approach to tuning parameters based on patient physiology. We used a physiologically realistic computational model of the basal ganglia network to investigate the emergence of a 34 Hz oscillation in the PD state and its optimal suppression with DBS. Discrete time transfer functions were fit to post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) collected in open-loop, by simulating the pharmacological block of synaptic connections, to describe the behavior of the basal ganglia nuclei. These functions were then connected to create a mean-field model of the closed-loop system, which was analyzed to determine the origin of the emergent 34 Hz pathological oscillation. This analysis determined that the oscillation could emerge from the coupling between the globus pallidus external (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). When coupled, the two resonate with each other in the PD state but not in the healthy state. By characterizing how this oscillation is affected by subthreshold DBS pulses, we hypothesize that it is possible to predict stimulus frequencies capable of suppressing this oscillation. To characterize the response to the stimulus, we developed a new method for estimating phase response curves (PRCs) from population data.

The objectives of this study are to (1) characterize performance effects of working progressively further off telescope viewing axis and (2) compare the ability of expert laparoscopic surgeons and non-expert surgeons to compensate for the psychomotor problems imposed by off-axis viewing. Methods: Subjects included Baystate Medical Center surgical residents between PGY 1 and PGY 5 training years and attending surgeons. Expert subjects (>250 basic and >50 advanced laparoscopic cases, N = 6) and non-expert subjects (N = 11) performed the FLS peg transfer task in a box trainer configured to accept a laparoscope inserted at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°viewing angles relative to axis of working instruments. Performance measures included time to task completion (seconds), errors (# dropped objects), and percent completed transfers. Statistical analysis took into account repeated measures within each subject for each performance measure. Trends were assessed using linear contrasts for trend (p-trend). Differences between experts and non-experts were evaluated using an interaction term (p-interaction). Results: Overall there was increased time to completion (p < 0.001), increased number of dropped pegs (p < 0.001), and decreased percentage of completed transfers (<0.001) as the viewing axis relative to working instruments increased from 0° to 180°. Overall, expert laparoscopic surgeons demonstrated significantly shorter time to completion (p < 0.0027), fewer dropped pegs (p < 0.001), and higher percentage of completed peg transfers (p < 0.0001) compared to non-expert surgeons. Conclusions: Surgeon performance degrades as viewing axis increases from 0° to 180° relative to working instruments. Expert laparoscopic surgeons perform better than non-expert surgeons when working off the laparoscope viewing axis. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Laparoscopic training; Simulation; Viewing axis","adult; article; controlled study; expert laparoscopic surgeon; female; human; job performance; laparoscope; laparoscopic surgery; male; medical expert; non expert laparoscopic surgeon; normal human; physical parameters; priority journal; professional competence; resident; simulation; surgeon; surgical training; task performance; telescope; viewing axis; clinical competence; laparoscope; laparoscopy; medical education; middle aged; operation duration; procedures; standards; task performance; time; Adult; Clinical Competence; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopes; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906939847

As more complex optical phenomena are widely employed in research and industry, it is necessary to expand the use of numerical simulation methods. Historically, laser-matter interactions have involved calculations of 'classical' wave propagation by Maxwell's equations and photon absorption through rate equations using numerous approximations. We describe a novel numerical modeling framework that adapts itself for simulation of different types of active materials provided by a simple graphical input. Our framework combines classical electric field propagation with 'active' photon absorption kinetics using computational active photonic building blocks (APBB). It allows investigating a plane electromagnetic wave propagating through generic organic or inorganic photoactive materials; while, 'active' photo-transitions are implemented using the APBB algorithm on the user interface. To date we have used the method in multiphoton absorbers, upconversion, semiconductor quantum dots, rare earth ions, organic chromophores, singlet oxygen formation, energy transfer, and optically-induced chemical reactions. We will demonstrate the method with applications of amplification in rare-earth ions and multiple two-photon absorbers materials in tandem. © 2014 SPIE.","Comprehensive simulation of optical; Computational electromagnetic; Numerical simulation methods","Chromophores; Computational electromagnetics; Computer simulation; Electric fields; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Energy transfer; Industrial research; Metal ions; Multiphoton processes; Numerical models; Optoelectronic devices; Photons; Secondary batteries; User interfaces; Comprehensive simulation of optical; Electric field propagation; Laser beam transmission; Laser-matter interactions; Numerical simulation method; Organic chromophores; Photoactive materials; Singlet oxygen formation; Interfaces (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901757208

We developed four prototypes based on different CDSS feature designs, and tested them in simulated end-of-life patient handoff sessions with a group of 40 nurse clinicians. We show how our prototypes directed nurses towards an optimal care decision that was rarely performed in unassisted practice. We also discuss the effect of CDSS layout and interface navigation in a nurse's acceptance of suggested actions. These findings provide insights into effective nursing CDSS design that are generalizable to care scenarios different than end-of-life.","Clinical decision support; Electronic health records; Human computer interaction; Nursing","Artificial intelligence; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Nursing; Tools; Care planning; Clinical decision support; Clinical decision support systems; Clinical settings; Decision making process; Documentation tools; Electronic health record; Patient care; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900558405

Further research is necessary to develop validated clinical performance assessment tools and show an improvement in outcomes after training. We aimed to establish evidence for validity of a previously published scoring instrumentVthe Clinical Performance Tool (CPT)Vdesigned to evaluate clinical performance during simulated pediatric resuscitations. Methods: This was a prospective experimental trial performed in the simulation laboratory of a pediatric tertiary care facility, with a pretest/posttest design that assessed residents before and after pediatric advanced life support (PALS) certification. Thirteen postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) and 11 PGY3 pediatric residents completed 5 simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios each during 2 consecutive sessions; between the 2 sessions, they completed a full PALS certification course. All sessions were video recorded. Sessions were scored by raters using the CPT; total scores were expressed as a percentage of maximum points possible for each scenario. Validity evidence was established and interpreted according to Messick's framework. Evidence regarding relations to other variables was assessed by calculating differences in scores between pre-PALS and post-PALS certification and PGY1 and PGY3 using a repeated-measures analysis of variance test. Internal structure evidence was established by assessing interrater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each scenario, a G-study, and a variance component analysis of individual measurement facets (scenarios, raters, and occasions) and associated interactions. Results: Overall scores for the entire study cohort improved by 10% after PALS training. Scores improved by 9.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5Y15.4) for the pulseless nonshockable arrest (ICC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74Y0.92), 14.6% (95% CI, 6.7Y22.4) for the pulseless shockable arrest (ICC, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96Y0.99), 4.1% (95% CI, j4.5 to 12.8) for the dysrhythmias (ICC, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87Y0.96), 18.4% (95% CI, 9.7Y27.1) for the respiratory scenario (ICC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95Y0.98), and 5.3% (95% CI, j1.4 to 2.0) for the shock scenarios (ICC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90Y0.97). There were no differences between PGY1 and PGY3 scores before or after the PALS course. Reliability of the instrument was acceptable as demonstrated by a mean ICC of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94Y0.96). The G-study coefficient was 0.94. Most variance could be attributed to the subject (57%). Interactions between subject and scenario and subject and occasion were 9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, and variance attributable to rater was minimal (0%). Conclusions: Pediatric residents improved scores on CPT after completion of a PALS course. Clinical Performance Tool scores are sensitive to the increase in skills and knowledge resulting from such a course but not to learners' levels. Validity evidence from scores for the CPT confirms implementation in new contexts and partially supports internal structure. More evidence is required to further support internal structure and especially to support relations with other variables and consequence evidence. Additional modifications should be made to the CPT before considering its use for high-stakes certification such as PALS. © 2014 Society for Simulation in Healthcare.","Assessment; Education; Pediatric advanced life support; Pediatric resuscitation; Simulation","adult; child; clinical competence; education; female; human; male; medical education; microclimate; pediatrics; preschool child; prospective study; reproducibility; resuscitation; standards; teaching; validation study; young adult; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Competence; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Life Support Systems; Male; Patient Simulation; Pediatrics; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Resuscitation; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919486781

Research in this area is particularly motivated by recent advances in laser applications in diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Temperature as a side effect also limits the maximum power of optical transfer and harvesting of energy in implantable neural prostheses. The main objective was to investigate the thermal effect of a near-infrared laser beam directly aimed at the brain cortex. A small, custom-made thermal probe was inserted into the rat brain to make direct measurements of temperature elevations induced by a free-air circular laser beam. The time dependence and the spatial distribution of the temperature increases were studied and the maximum allowable optical power was determined to be 2.27 W/cm2 for a corresponding temperature increase of 0.5°C near the cortical surface. The results can be extrapolated for other temperature elevations, where the margin to reach potentially damaging temperatures is more relaxed, by taking advantage of linearity. It is concluded that the thermal effect depends on several factors such as the thermal properties of the neural tissue and of its surrounding structures, the optical properties of the particular neural tissue, and the laser beam size and shape. Because so many parameters play a role, the thermal effect should be investigated for each specific application separately using realistic in vivo models. © The Authors.","Laser safety; Near-infrared penetration; Tissue-light interaction","Circular laser beams; Direct measurement; Near Infrared; Near-infrared lasers; Neurological disorders; Temperature elevation; Temperature increase; Tissue-light interaction; Infrared devices; Laser applications; Laser beams; Laser safety; Rats; Tissue; tungsten; absorption; animal; article; body temperature; brain; computer simulation; electrode; equipment design; laser; light; nerve cell; neurologic disease; optics; pathology; radiation exposure; radiation scattering; rat; reproducibility; Sprague Dawley rat; temperature; Absorption; Animals; Body Temperature; Brain; Computer Simulation; Electrodes; Equipment Design; Lasers; Light; Nervous System Diseases; Neurons; Optics and Photonics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reproducibility of Results; Scattering, Radiation; Temperature; Tungsten",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897769463

While the cell’s behavior can still usefully be considered as feature detection acting on a fluctuating input, some of the coding capacity of the cell is taken up by the increased firing rate due to a constant “driving” direct current (DC) stimulus. Furthermore, both the DC input and the post-spike refractory period generate regular firing, reducing the spike-timing entropy available for encoding time-varying fluctuations. In this paper, we address these issues, focusing on the example of motoneurons in which an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) current plays a dominant role regularizing firing behavior. We explore the accuracy and generalizability of several alternative models for single neurons under changes in DC and variance of the stimulus input. We use a motoneuron simulation to compare coding models in neurons with and without the AHP current. Finally, we quantify the tradeoff between instantaneously encoding information about fluctuations and about the DC. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","After-hyperpolarization; Covariance modes; Motoneurons; Neural filters; SK channels; Spike-triggered Reverse correlation","afterhyperpolarization; animal tissue; Article; cell function; controlled study; direct current; female; intermethod comparison; male; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; motoneuron; nerve conduction; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; rat; spike wave; action potential; animal; biological model; biophysics; in vitro study; nerve cell; nonlinear system; patch clamp technique; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Action Potentials; Animals; Biophysics; Female; In Vitro Techniques; Male; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912030711

This study aims to explore the feasibility of mixed frequency and phase coding in building a high-speed SSVEP speller with a computer monitor. A frequency and phase approximation approach was developed to eliminate the limitation of the number of targets caused by the monitor refresh rate, resulting in a speller comprising 32 flickers specified by eight frequencies (8-15 Hz with a 1 Hz interval) and four phases (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°).

It is now commonly accepted that the lithographic and etch effects should be modeled and corrected in a sequential and staged way: a resist (or lithographic) model should be created and used for lithographic effect compensation, and an etch model should be created and used for etch effect compensation. However, there can be various degrees of separation of these two modeling stages. In order to optimally capture the significant variation in the post-development resist patterns and post-etching patterns, it is helpful to integrate these two processes together for the OPC model calibration practice. In this paper, we analyze the integrated simulation approach in OPC modeling where the entire resist model information is made fully accessible in the etch modeling stage to allow the possibility of resist and etch co-optimization, e.g. through adjusting the resist model to optimally fit the etch data. Furthermore, the integrated simulation technique is integrated into a verification flow to simplify the conventional staged flow. © 2014 SPIE.","Etch correction; Integrated lithography and etch simulation; OPC modeling; Process proximity correction","Etching; Lithography; Photoresists; Critical dimension; Effect corrections; Etch correction; Etch simulation; Integrated simulations; OPC modeling; Optical proximity corrections; Process proximity corrections; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901808800

When researchers evaluate brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, we want quantitative answers to questions such as: How good is the system's performance? How good does it need to be? and: Is it capable of reaching the desired level in future? In response to the current lack of objective, quantitative, study-independent approaches, we introduce methods that help to address such questions. We identified three challenges: (I) the need for efficient measurement techniques that adapt rapidly and reliably to capture a wide range of performance levels; (II) the need to express results in a way that allows comparison between similar but non-identical tasks; (III) the need to measure the extent to which certain components of a BCI system (e.g. the signal processing pipeline) not only support BCI performance, but also potentially restrict the maximum level it can reach. Approach. For challenge (I), we developed an automatic staircase method that adjusted task difficulty adaptively along a single abstract axis. For challenge (II), we used the rate of information gain between two Bernoulli distributions: one reflecting the observed success rate, the other reflecting chance performance estimated by a matched random-walk method. This measure includes Wolpaw's information transfer rate as a special case, but addresses the latter's limitations including its restriction to item-selection tasks. To validate our approach and address challenge (III), we compared four healthy subjects' performance using an EEG-based BCI, a 'Direct Controller' (a high-performance hardware input device), and a 'Pseudo-BCI Controller' (the same input device, but with control signals processed by the BCI signal processing pipeline). Main results. Our results confirm the repeatability and validity of our measures, and indicate that our BCI signal processing pipeline reduced attainable performance by about 33% (21 bits min-1). Significance. Our approach provides a flexible basis for evaluating BCI performance and its limitations, across a wide range of tasks and task difficulties. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain-computer interface; information gain; information transfer rate; neuroprosthetics; performance evaluation","Biomedical signal processing; Interfaces (computer); Knobs; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Signal processing; Bernoulli distributions; High-performance hardware; Information gain; Information transfer rate; Measurement techniques; Neuroprosthetics; performance evaluation; System's performance; Brain computer interface; adult; amplitude modulation; article; brain computer interface; computer simulation; electroencephalogram; female; human; human experiment; left handedness; male; measurement repeatability; middle aged; normal human; performance measurement system; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; probability; right handedness; signal processing; task performance; time; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897471559

In fMRI, hypotheses about how context modulates distributed patterns of information processing are often tested by comparing functional connectivity between neural regions A and B as a function of task conditions X and Y, which is termed context-modulated functional connectivity (FC). There exist two exploratory statistical approaches to testing context-modulated FC: the beta-series method and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis methods. While these approaches are commonly used, their relative power for detecting context-modulated FC is unknown, especially with respect to real-world experimental parameters (e.g., number of stimulus repetitions, inter-trial-interval, stimulus duration). Here, we use simulations to compare power for detecting context-modulated FC between the standard PPI formulation (sPPI), generalized PPI formulation (gPPI), and beta series methods. Simulation results demonstrate that gPPI and beta series methods are generally more powerful than sPPI. Whether gPPI or beta series methods performed more powerfully depended on experiment parameters: block designs favor the gPPI, whereas the beta series method was more powerful for designs with more trial repetitions and it also retained more power under conditions of hemodynamic response function variability. On a real dataset of adolescent girls, the PPI methods appeared to have greater sensitivity in detecting task-modulated FC when using a block design and the beta series method appeared to have greater sensitivity when using an event-related design with many trial repetitions. Implications of these performance results are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","FMRI; Functional connectivity; Psychophysiological interaction analysis","adolescent; article; beta series method; brain function; brain region; causal modeling; controlled study; executive function; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; normal human; priority journal; psychophysiological interaction analysis; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; task performance; fMRI; Functional connectivity; Psychophysiological interaction analysis; Adolescent; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Neural Pathways",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887512304

When test datasets are not available, cross-validation is commonly used to estimate the error rate. Many machine learning methods are available, and it is well known that no universally best method exists in general. It has been a common practice to apply many machine learning methods and report the method that produces the smallest cross-validation error rate. Theoretically, such a procedure produces a selection bias. Consequently, many clinical studies with moderate sample sizes (e.g. n = 30-60) risk reporting a falsely small cross-validation error rate that could not be validated later in independent cohorts.Results: In this article, we illustrated the probabilistic framework of the problem and explored the statistical and asymptotic properties. We proposed a new bias correction method based on learning curve fitting by inverse power law (IPL) and compared it with three existing methods: nested cross-validation, weighted mean correction and Tibshirani-Tibshirani procedure. All methods were compared in simulation datasets, five moderate size real datasets and two large breast cancer datasets. The result showed that IPL outperforms the other methods in bias correction with smaller variance, and it has an additional advantage to extrapolate error estimates for larger sample sizes, a practical feature to recommend whether more samples should be recruited to improve the classifier and accuracy.

Behavioral studies show that humans impute structure into simple learning problems, even when this tendency affords no behavioral advantage. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate the neural dynamics indicative of such incidental latent structure. Event-related potentials over lateral prefrontal cortex, typically observed for instructed task rules, were stratified according to individual participants' constructed rule sets. Moreover, this individualized latent rule structure could be independently decoded from multielectrode pattern classification. Both neural markers were predictive of participants' ability to subsequently generalize rule structure to new contexts. These EEG dynamics reveal that the human brain spontaneously constructs hierarchically structured representations during learning of simple task rules. © 2014 the authors.","EEG; Prefrontal cortex; Reinforcement learning; Rules; Task-set","article; behavior; brain depth stimulation; electroencephalograph electrode; electroencephalography; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; latent period; learning; learning disorder; male; nerve cell network; normal human; pattern recognition; prefrontal cortex; premotor cortex; priority journal; reinforcement; simulation; task performance; temporal cortex; topography; EEG; prefrontal cortex; reinforcement learning; rules; task-set; Brain Mapping; Color Perception; Computer Simulation; Cues; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Models, Biological; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Reaction Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897881519

WHO/CDC recommendations prioritize vaccinations mainly on the basis of age and co-morbidities, but have never considered influenza infection history of individuals for vaccination targeting. We evaluated such influenza vaccination policies through small-world contact networks simulations. Further, to verify our findings we analyzed, independently, large-scale empirical data of influenza diagnosis from the two largest Health Maintenance Organizations in Israel, together covering more than 74% of the Israeli population. These longitudinal individual-level data include about nine million cases of influenza diagnosed over a decade. Through contact network epidemiology simulations, we found that individuals previously infected with influenza have a disproportionate probability of being highly connected within networks and transmitting to others. Therefore, we showed that prioritizing those previously infected for vaccination would be more effective than a random vaccination policy in reducing infection. The effectiveness of such a policy is robust over a range of epidemiological assumptions, including cross-reactivity between influenza strains conferring partial protection as high as 55%. Empirically, our analysis of the medical records confirms that in every age group, case definition for influenza, clinical diagnosis, and year tested, patients infected in the year prior had a substantially higher risk of becoming infected in the subsequent year. Accordingly, considering individual infection history in targeting and promoting influenza vaccination is predicted to be a highly effective supplement to the current policy. Our approach can also be generalized for other infectious disease, computer viruses, or ecological networks. © 2014 Yamin et al.",,"article; contact examination; controlled study; cross reaction; disease severity; health care policy; human; infection risk; infection sensitivity; influenza vaccination; Israel; major clinical study; medical record; patient identification; patient selection; risk assessment; social interaction; virus transmission; algorithm; Disease Outbreaks; incidence; Influenza, Human; mass immunization; procedures; season; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; influenza vaccine; Algorithms; Disease Outbreaks; Health Policy; Humans; Incidence; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Israel; Mass Vaccination; Seasons; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901650133

To reduce ACL injury risk, one option is to improve muscle strength and/or the activation of muscles crossing the knee under elevated external loading. This study's purpose was to characterize the relative force production of the muscles supporting the knee during the weight-acceptance (WA) phase of single-leg jump landing and investigate the gastrocnemii forces compared to the hamstrings forces. Amateur male Western Australian Rules Football players completed a single-leg jump landing protocol and six participants were randomly chosen for further modeling and simulation. A three-dimensional, 14-segment, 37 degree-of-freedom, 92 muscle-tendon actuated model was created for each participant in OpenSim. Computed muscle control was used to generate 12 muscle-driven simulations, 2 trials per participant, of the WA phase of single-leg jump landing. A one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis showed both the quadriceps and gastrocnemii muscle force estimates were significantly greater than the hamstrings (p<0.001). Elevated gastrocnemii forces corresponded with increased joint compression and lower ACL forces. The elevated quadriceps and gastrocnemii forces during landing may represent a generalized muscle strategy to increase knee joint stiffness, protecting the knee and ACL from external knee loading and injury risk. These results contribute to our understanding of how muscle's function during single-leg jump landing and should serve as the foundation for novel muscle-targeted training intervention programs aimed to reduce ACL injuries in sport. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Computed muscle control; Computer simulation; Injury prevention; Knee loading; Musculoskeletal modeling","Computer simulation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Joints (anatomy); Landing; Sports; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Football players; Injury prevention; Knee joint stiffness; Model and simulation; Muscle controls; Musculoskeletal model; Training intervention; Muscle; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anthropometric parameters; Article; athlete; body weight; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; correlational study; data analysis software; digital filtering; electromyography; football; gastrocnemius muscle; hamstring; human; joint stiffness; jumping; kinematics; load carrying capacity; male; mathematical computing; mathematical model; motion analysis system; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strain; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; quadriceps tendon; randomized controlled trial; single leg jump landing; sport injury; stress strain relationship; task performance; tendon stress; weight acceptance phase; anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; injuries; knee; knee injury; leg; movement (physiology); muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; risk; skeletal muscle; soccer; tendon; weight bearing; young adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Leg; Male; Movement; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Quadriceps Muscle; Risk; Soccer; Tendons; Weight-Bearing; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908635441

Many BCI technologies are adversely affected by these changes in user state, limiting their application and constraining their use to relatively short temporal epochs where behavioral performance is likely to be stable. Incorporating a passive BCI that detects when the user is performing poorly at a primary task, and adapts accordingly may prove to increase overall user performance. Here, we explore the potential for extending an established method to generate continuous estimates of behavioral performance from ongoing neural activity; evaluating the extended method by applying it to the original task domain, simulated driving; and generalizing the method by applying it to a BCI-relevant perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we used EEG log power spectra and sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) to estimate endogenous changes in behavior in both a simulated driving task and a perceptual discrimination task. For the driving task the average correlation coefficient between the actual and estimated lane deviation was 0.37 ± 0.22 (μ ± σ). For the perceptual discrimination task we generated estimates of accuracy, reaction time, and button press duration for each participant. The correlation coefficients between the actual and estimated behavior were similar for these three metrics (accuracy = 0.25 ± 0.37, reaction time = 0.33 ± 0.23, button press duration = 0.36 ± 0.30). These findings illustrate the potential for modeling time-on-task decrements in performance from concurrent measures of neural activity. © 2014 Touryan, Apker, Lance, Kerick, Ries and McDowell.","BCI; Driving; EEG; Fatigue; Performance estimation; Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)","accuracy; adult; article; behavior; boredom; clinical article; electroencephalogram; electroencephalograph electrode; fatigue; female; human; malaise; male; muscle fatigue; perception; power spectrum; reaction time; right hemisphere; spectrometry; task performance; visual analog scale; visual disorder; visual fatigue",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905035942

In SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), a realistic task-based approach involves detection and localization of perfusion defects, as well as a subsequent assessment of defect severity. In this paper we explore a machine-learning MO based on Naive- Bayes classification (NB-MO). NB-MO uses a set of polar-map image features to predict lesion detection, localization and severity scores given by five human readers for a set of simulated 3D SPECT-MPI patients. The simulated dataset included lesions with different sizes, perfusion-reduction ratios, and locations. Simulated projections were reconstructed using two readily used methods namely: FBP and OSEM.

Although many methods for local ancestry inference have been proposed, most are designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to make use of the full spectrum of data available from sequencing. In addition, current haplotype-based approaches are very computationally demanding, requiring large computational time for moderately large sample sizes. Here we present new methods for local ancestry inference that leverage continent-specific variants (CSVs) to attain increased performance over existing approaches in sequenced admixed genomes. A key feature of our approach is that it incorporates the admixed genomes themselves jointly with public datasets, such as 1000 Genomes, to improve the accuracy of CSV calling. We use simulations to show that our approach attains accuracy similar to widely used computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with large decreases in runtime. Most importantly, we show that our method recovers comparable local ancestries, as the 1000 Genomes consensus local ancestry calls in the real admixed individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. We extend our approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and show that accurate local ancestry inference can be attained at low sequencing coverage. Finally, we generalize CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs) and show that in some cases it is possible to determine the sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments on the basis of sCSVs. © 2014 Brown, Pasaniuc.",,"ancestry group; article; continent specific variant; gene sequence; genetic database; genetic variability; genome; genotype; haplotype; human; local ancestry inference; machine learning; measurement accuracy; multiracial person; sequence analysis; genealogy; human genome; Genealogy and Heraldry; Genome, Human; Haplotypes; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901301075

Background: The effects of workload, fatigue, practice, and time on a specific task can be separated with the two models and an appropriate experimental design. Group dynamics add further complications to the understanding of workload and fatigue effects for teams. Method: In this experiment, 141 undergraduates responded to target stimuli that appeared on a simulated security camera display at three rates of speed while completing a jigsaw puzzle. Participants worked alone or in pairs and completed additional measurements prior to or after the main tasks. Results: The workload cusp verified the expected effects of speed and frustration on change in performance. The fatigue cusp showed that positive and negative changes in performance were greater if more work on the secondary task was completed and whether the participants who started with the fast vigilance condition demonstrated less fatigue. Conclusion: The results supported the efficacy of the cusp models and suggested, furthermore, that training modules that varied speed of presentation could buffer the effects of fatigue. Application: The cusp models can be used to analyze virtually any cognitively demanding task set. The particular results generalize to vigilance tasks, although a wider range of conditions within vigilance tasks needs to be investigated further. © 2013, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","cognitive workload; cusp catastrophe; dual task performance; fatigue; speed; vigilance","Ergonomics; Fatigue of materials; Human engineering; Speed; Catastrophe model; Cognitive workloads; Cusp catastrophe; Cusp catastrophe model; Dual-task performance; Emotional intelligence; Performance dynamics; vigilance; Dynamics; adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; article; attention; biological model; fatigue; female; frustration; human; male; pathophysiology; reaction time; task performance; workload; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Fatigue; Female; Frustration; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Workload; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900554474

This paper discusses an approximation of the likelihood in these models that can greatly facilitate computation. The basic idea is to replace a sum that appears in the exact log-likelihood by an expectation over the model covariates; the resulting ""expected log-likelihood"" can in many cases be computed significantly faster than the exact log-likelihood. In many neuroscience experiments the distribution over model covariates is controlled by the experimenter and the expected log-likelihood approximation becomes particularly useful; for example, estimators based on maximizing this expected log-likelihood (or a penalized version thereof) can often be obtained with orders of magnitude computational savings compared to the exact maximum likelihood estimators. A risk analysis establishes that these maximum EL estimators often come with little cost in accuracy (and in some cases even improved accuracy) compared to standard maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, we find that these methods can significantly decrease the computation time of marginal likelihood calculations for model selection and of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for sampling from the posterior parameter distribution. We illustrate our results by applying these methods to a computationally-challenging dataset of neural spike trains obtained via large-scale multi-electrode recordings in the primate retina. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","Computationally efficient algorithms; Expected log-likelihood; Generalized linear models; Neural coding","accuracy; algorithm; article; log likelihood; magnitude estimation method; maximum likelihood method; Monte Carlo method; neuroscience; priority journal; probability; recording; retina ganglion cell; risk assessment; spike wave; statistical model; Animals; Computer Simulation; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Linear Models; Models, Neurological; Neurons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896549426

The human visual system encodes the incoming stimulus and transfers its contents into three major memory systems with increasing time scales, viz., sensory (or iconic) memory, visual short-term memory (VSTM), and long-term memory (LTM). It is commonly believed that the major bottleneck of information processing resides in VSTM. In contrast to this view, we show major bottlenecks for motion processing prior to VSTM. In the first experiment, we examined bottlenecks at the stimulus encoding stage through a partial-report technique by delivering the cue immediately at the end of the stimulus presentation. In the second experiment, we varied the cue delay to investigate sensory memory and VSTM. Performance decayed exponentially as a function of cue delay and we used the time-constant of the exponential-decay to demarcate sensory memory from VSTM. We then decomposed performance in terms of quality and quantity measures to analyze bottlenecks along these dimensions. In terms of the quality of information, two thirds to three quarters of the motion-processing bottleneck occurs in stimulus encoding rather than memory stages. In terms of the quantity of information, the motion-processing bottleneck is distributed, with the stimulus-encoding stage accounting for one third of the bottleneck. The bottleneck for the stimulusencoding stage is dominated by the selection compared to the filtering function of attention. We also found that the filtering function of attention is operating mainly at the sensory memory stage in a specific manner, i.e., influencing only quantity and sparing quality. These results provide a novel and more complete understanding of information processing and storage bottlenecks for motion processing. © 2013 Öǧmen et al.",,"Adult; Computer Simulation; Humans; Memory, Long-Term; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Biological; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Time Factors; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894272290

To explore the interactions between cellular metabolism and HSV-1 infection, we performed an siRNA screen of cellular metabolic genes, measuring their effect on viral replication. The screen identified multiple enzymes predicted to influence HSV-1 replication, including argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (AS1), which consumes aspartate as part of de novo arginine synthesis. Knockdown of AS1 robustly enhanced viral genome replication and the production of infectious virus. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we found that the metabolic phenotype induced by knockdown of AS1 in human fibroblasts mimicked multiple aspects of the metabolic program observed during HSV-1 infection, including an increase in multiple nucleotides and their precursors. Together with the observation that AS1 protein and mRNA levels decrease during wild-type infection, this work suggests that reduced AS1 activity is partially responsible for the metabolic program induced by infection.","Herpesviruses; Metabolomics","5' methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; acyltransferase; arginine decarboxylase; argininosuccinate synthase; argininosuccinate synthetase 1; argininosuccinic acid; aspartate aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase isoenzyme 2; aspartic acid; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase II; enzyme precursor; fk 506 binding protein; glutamate decarboxylase; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; heparan sulfate; methionine transfer RNA; methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; nucleotide; pUl30 protein; pyruvate carboxylase; small interfering RNA; sulfotransferase; synaptotagmin; syntaxin; syntaxin 10; syntaxin 19; unclassified drug; virus DNA; virus protein; XRCC4 protein; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme metabolism; fibroblast; gene identification; herpes simplex; Herpes simplex virus 1; herpes simplex virus 1 infection; human; human cell; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; phenotype; precursor; priority journal; protein depletion; protein synthesis; virus genome; virus infectivity; virus replication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890833382

To reduce model complexity, alleviate overfitting, and thus facilitate model interpretation, sparse representation and estimation of functional connectivity is needed. Sparsities include global sparsity, which captures the sparse connectivities between neurons, and local sparsity, which reflects the active temporal ranges of the input-output dynamical interactions. In this paper, we formulate a generalized functional additive model (GFAM) and develop the associated penalized likelihood estimation methods for such a modeling problem. A GFAM consists of a set of basis functions convolving the input signals, and a link function generating the firing probability of the output neuron from the summation of the convolutions weighted by the sought model coefficients. Model sparsities are achieved by using various penalized likelihood estimations and basis functions. Specifically, we introduce two variations of the GFAM using a global basis (e.g.; Laguerre basis) and group LASSO estimation, and a local basis (e.g.; B-spline basis) and group bridge estimation, respectively. We further develop an optimization method based on quadratic approximation of the likelihood function for the estimation of these models. Simulation and experimental results show that both group-LASSO-Laguerre and group-bridge-B-spline can capture faithfully the global sparsities, while the latter can replicate accurately and simultaneously both global and local sparsities. The sparse models outperform the full models estimated with the standard maximum likelihood method in out-of-sample predictions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Basis function; Functional connectivity; Generalized linear model; Penalized likelihood; Sparsity; Spike trains; Temporal coding","accuracy; animal experiment; article; basis function; behavior; controlled study; generalized functional additive model; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA3 region; intermethod comparison; male; memory; nervous system parameters; neural functional connectivity; nonhuman; penalized likelihood estimation; priority journal; process development; rat; statistical analysis; statistical model; algorithm; animal; biological model; computer simulation; cytology; electrophysiology; nerve cell; nerve tract; physiology; Algorithms; Animals; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; CA3 Region, Hippocampal; Computer Simulation; Electrophysiological Processes; Likelihood Functions; Linear Models; Memory; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Neurons; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886600772

Our goal was to design an adaptive neuroprosthetic controller that could learn the mapping from neural states to prosthetic actions and automatically adjust adaptation using only a binary evaluative feedback as a measure of desirability/undesirability of performance. Approach. Hebbian reinforcement learning (HRL) in a connectionist network was used for the design of the adaptive controller. The method combines the efficiency of supervised learning with the generality of reinforcement learning. The convergence properties of this approach were studied using both closed-loop control simulations and open-loop simulations that used primate neural data from robot-assisted reaching tasks. Main results. The HRL controller was able to perform classification and regression tasks using its episodic and sequential learning modes, respectively. In our experiments, the HRL controller quickly achieved convergence to an effective control policy, followed by robust performance. The controller also automatically stopped adapting the parameters after converging to a satisfactory control policy. Additionally, when the input neural vector was reorganized, the controller resumed adaptation to maintain performance. Significance. By estimating an evaluative feedback directly from the user, the HRL control algorithm may provide an efficient method for autonomous adaptation of neuroprosthetic systems. This method may enable the user to teach the controller the desired behavior using only a simple feedback signal. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Adaptive controllers; Closed-loop control; Connectionist networks; Convergence properties; Open-loop simulations; Robust performance; Satisfactory control; Sequential learning; Algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Controllers; algorithm; article; binocular convergence; feedback system; hebbian reinforcement learning; learning; neuroprosthesis; nonhuman; priority journal; simulation; Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Callithrix; Learning; Neural Prostheses; Random Allocation; Reinforcement (Psychology)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889056477

Aerosol particles can influence DCCs by altering cloud properties, precipitation regimes, and radiation balance. Previous studies reported both invigoration and suppression of DCCs by aerosols, but few were concerned with the whole life cycle of DCC. By conducting multiple monthlong cloud-resolving simulations with spectral-bin cloud microphysics that capture the observed macrophysical and microphysical properties of summer convective clouds and precipitation in the tropics and midlatitudes, this study provides a comprehensive view of how aerosols affect cloud cover, cloud top height, and radiative forcing. We found that although the widely accepted theory of DCC invigoration due to aerosol's thermodynamic effect (additional latent heat release from freezing of greater amount of cloud water) may work during the growing stage, it is microphysical effect influenced by aerosols that drives the dramatic increase in cloud cover, cloud top height, and cloud thickness at the mature and dissipation stages by inducing larger amounts of smaller but longer-lasting ice particles in the stratiform/ anvils of DCCs, even when thermodynamic invigoration of convection is absent. The thermodynamic invigoration effect contributes up to ~27% of total increase in cloud cover.

In most cases, however, these models do not account for the effects that group structure and cultural traditions within a human population have on the costs and benefits of its members' decisions. Nor do they consider the likelihood that cultural as well as genetic traits will be subject to natural selection. In this paper, we present an agent-based model that incorporates some key aspects of human social structure and life history. We investigate the evolution of a population under conditions of different environmental harshness and in which selection can occur at the level of the group as well as the level of the individual. We focus on the evolution of a socially learned characteristic related to individuals' willingness to contribute to raising the offspring of others within their family group. We find that environmental harshness increases the frequency of individuals who make such contributions. However, under the conditions we stipulate, we also find that environmental variability can allow groups to survive with lower frequencies of helpers. The model presented here is inevitably a simplified representation of a human population, but it provides a basis for future modeling work toward evolutionary explanations of human behavior that consider the influence of both genetic and cultural transmission of behavior. © 2013 Smaldino et al.",,"article; behavior; cooperative breeding; environment; environment harshness; environmental change; evolution; gene transfer; group dynamics; harsh environment; human; human characteristic; life history; natural selection; population model; progeny; social structure; adaptation; biological model; child parent relation; child rearing; computer simulation; cooperation; family; population dynamics; preschool child; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Child Rearing; Child, Preschool; Computer Simulation; Cooperative Behavior; Environment; Family; Humans; Models, Biological; Parenting; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893796052

Here, we present a model of the underlying neuronal dynamics based upon the idea that auditory cortex continuously updates a generative model to predict its sensory inputs. The MMN is then modelled as the superposition of the electric fields evoked by neuronal activity reporting prediction errors. The process by which auditory cortex generates predictions and resolves prediction errors was simulated using generalised (Bayesian) filtering - a biologically plausible scheme for probabilistic inference on the hidden states of hierarchical dynamical models. The resulting scheme generates realistic MMN waveforms, explains the qualitative effects of deviant probability and magnitude on the MMN - in terms of latency and amplitude - and makes quantitative predictions about the interactions between deviant probability and magnitude. This work advances a formal understanding of the MMN and - more generally - illustrates the potential for developing computationally informed dynamic causal models of empirical electromagnetic responses. © 2013 Lieder et al.",,"article; auditory stimulation; electromagnetic field; event related potential; mathematical model; mismatch negativity; prediction; stimulus response; Algorithms; Auditory Cortex; Bayes Theorem; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888246692

How rhythms of different frequency interact - and the function of these interactions - remains an active area of research. Many methods have been proposed to assess the interactions between different frequency rhythms, in particular measures that characterize the relationship between the phase of a low frequency rhythm and the amplitude envelope of a high frequency rhythm. However, an optimal analysis method to assess this cross-frequency coupling (CFC) does not yet exist. New method: Here we describe a new procedure to assess CFC that utilizes the generalized linear modeling (GLM) framework. Results: We illustrate the utility of this procedure in three synthetic examples. The proposed GLM-CFC procedure allows a rapid and principled assessment of CFC with confidence bounds, scales with the intensity of the CFC, and accurately detects biphasic coupling. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to existing methods, the proposed GLM-CFC procedure is easily interpretable, possesses confidence intervals that are easy and efficient to compute, and accurately detects biphasic coupling. Conclusions: The GLM-CFC statistic provides a method for accurate and statistically rigorous assessment of CFC. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Gamma; Oscillations; Phase-amplitude coupling; Theta","article; bootstrapping; comparative study; cross frequency coupling; electroencephalogram; neuroscience; parameters; predictor variable; priority journal; response variable; simulation; statistical model; time series analysis; Gamma; Oscillations; Phase-amplitude coupling; Theta; Brain; Computer Simulation; Linear Models; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884405558

To characterize a homogeneous neuronal population, we use the master equation for generalized leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with shot-noise synapses. We develop fast semi-analytic numerical methods to solve this equation for either current or conductance synapses, with and without synaptic depression. We show that its solutions match simulations of equivalent neuronal networks better than those of the Fokker-Planck equation and we compute bounds on the network response to non-instantaneous synapses. We apply these methods to study different synaptic weight distributions in feed-forward networks. We characterize the synaptic amplitude distributions using a set of measures, called tail weight numbers, designed to quantify the preponderance of very strong synapses. Even if synaptic amplitude distributions are equated for both the total current and average synaptic weight, distributions with sparse but strong synapses produce higher responses for small inputs, leading to a larger operating range. Furthermore, despite their small number, such synapses enable the network to respond faster and with more stability in the face of external fluctuations. © 2013 Iyer et al.",,"article; cell population; controlled study; electric conductivity; mathematical computing; nerve cell inhibition; nerve cell network; positive feedback; process development; quantitative study; simulation; synaptic potential; synaptic weight; Action Potentials; Computer Simulation; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Synapses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887290826

Participants are scored on scenario-specific ideal behaviors associated with assistance, conflict resolution, communication, assertion, and situation assessment. This research sought to provide evidence of the validity and feasibility of SAFE-TeamS as a tool to support the advancement of science related to team skills training. METHODS: Thirty-eight medical and nursing students were assessed using SAFE-TeamS before and after team skills training. The SAFE-TeamS pretraining and posttraining scores were compared, and participants were surveyed. Generalizability analysis was used to estimate the variance in scores associated with the following: examinee, scenario, rater, pretraining/posttraining, examinee type, rater type (actor-live vs. external rater-videotape), actor team, and scenario order. RESULTS: The SAFE-TeamS scores reflected improvement after training and were sensitive to individual differences. Score variance due to rater was low. Variance due to scenario was moderate. Estimates of relative reliability for 2 raters and 8 scenarios ranged from 0.6 to 0.7. With fixed scenarios and raters, 2 raters and 2 scenarios, reliability is greater than 0.8. Raters believed SAFE-TeamS assessed relevant team skills. Examinees' responses were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: The SAFE-TeamS was sensitive to individual differences and team skill training, providing evidence for validity. It is not clear whether different scenarios measure different skills and whether the scenarios cover the necessary breadth of skills. Use of multiple scenarios will support assessment across a broader range of skills. Future research is required to determine whether assessments using SAFE-TeamS will translate to performance in clinical practice. © 2013 by the Society for Simulation in Healthcare.","Assertion; Assessment; Assistance; Communication; Conflict resolution; Situation assessment; Situation awareness; Team skills; TeamSTEPPS; Teamwork","article; clinical competence; computer simulation; education; feasibility study; health care quality; human; interdisciplinary communication; medical student; methodology; nursing student; organization and management; patient care; program evaluation; reproducibility; standard; validation study; videorecording; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Educational Measurement; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Patient Care Team; Program Evaluation; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Reproducibility of Results; Students, Medical; Students, Nursing; Videotape Recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885390283

Alteration in the kinetics of the CK reaction rate appears to play a central role in many disease states. In this study, we developed and implemented at ultra-high field (7T) a novel three-dimensional 31P-MT imaging sequence that maps the kinetics of CK in the entire volume of the lower leg at relatively high resolution (0.52 mL voxel size), and within acquisition times that can be tolerated by patients (below 60 min). We tested the sequence on five healthy and two clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects. Overall, we obtained measurements that are in close agreement with measurements reported previously using spectroscopic methods. Importantly, our spatially resolved method allowed us to measure local CK reaction rate constants and metabolic fluxes in individual muscles in a non-invasive manner. Furthermore, it allowed us to detect variations of the CK rates of different muscles, which would not have been possible using unlocalized MRS methods. The results of this work suggest that 3D mapping of the CK reaction rates and metabolic fluxes can be achieved in the skeletal muscle in vivo at relatively high spatial resolution and with acquisition times well tolerated by patients. The ability to measure bioenergetics simultaneously in large areas of muscles will bring new insights into possible heterogeneous patterns of muscle metabolism associated with several diseases and serve as a valuable tool for monitoring the efficacy of interventions. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Creatine kinase; Magnetization transfer; Muscle metabolism; Phosphorus MRI","Creatine kinase; Enzyme-catalyzed reactions; High spatial resolution; Magnetization transfer; Noninvasive measurements; Spatially resolved; Spectroscopic method; Three dimensional mapping; Adenosinetriphosphate; Biochemistry; Enzymes; Magnetization; Metabolism; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Physiology; Rate constants; Spectroscopic analysis; Three dimensional; Muscle; creatine kinase; adult; article; case report; controlled study; enzyme kinetics; enzyme metabolism; human; leg muscle; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; skeletal muscle; creatine kinase; magnetization transfer; muscle metabolism; phosphorus MRI; Adult; Computer Simulation; Creatine Kinase; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Kinetics; Leg; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Muscle, Skeletal; Phosphorus; Spin Labels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882284906

Genetic imprinting is related to several human disorders, including diabetes, breast cancer, alcoholism, and obesity. This phenomenon has been shown to be important for normal embryonic development in mammals. Traditional association approaches ignore this important genetic phenomenon. In this study, we generalize the natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA) framework to allow for estimation of both main allelic effects and POEs. We develop a statistical (Stat-POE) model that has the orthogonal estimates of parameters including the POEs. We conducted simulation studies for both quantitative and qualitative traits to evaluate the performance of the statistical and functional models with different levels of POEs. Our results showed that the newly proposed Stat-POE model, which ensures orthogonality of variance components if Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) or equal minor and major allele frequencies is satisfied, had greater power for detecting the main allelic additive effect than a Func-POE model, which codes according to allelic substitutions, for both quantitative and qualitative traits.

Decreased circulating leukocytes observed during and after space flight infer suppressed immune responses and susceptibility to infection. The microgravity aspect of the space environment has been simulated on Earth to study adverse biological effects in astronauts. In this report, the hindlimb unloading (HU) model was employed to investigate the combined effects of solar particle event-like proton radiation and simulated microgravity on immune cell parameters including lymphocyte subtype populations and activity. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell critical for adaptive immune responses and T lymphocytes are regulators of cell-mediated immunity, controlling the entire immune response. Mice were suspended prior to and after proton radiation exposure (2 Gy dose) and total leukocyte numbers and splenic lymphocyte functionality were evaluated on days 4 or 21 after combined HU and radiation exposure. Total white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts are reduced by approximately 65%, 70%, 55%, and 70%, respectively, compared to the non-treated control group at 4 days after combined exposure. Splenic lymphocyte subpopulations are altered at both time points investigated. At 21 days post-exposure to combined HU and proton radiation, T cell activation and proliferation were assessed in isolated lymphocytes. Cell surface expression of the Early Activation Marker, CD69, is decreased by 30% in the combined treatment group, compared to the non-treated control group and cell proliferation was suppressed by approximately 50%, compared to the non-treated control group. These findings reveal that the combined stressors (HU and proton radiation exposure) result in decreased leukocyte numbers and function, which could contribute to immune system dysfunction in crew members.

Prof Popova 5, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation","In 1973 The Center for Art Conservation Studies (CASS) was established at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). This was in response to demonstrations that were conducted during January-March 1972 in Venice for UNESCO, Venice in Peril, International Fund for Monuments, and the Italian Petroleum Institute (ENI). The feasibility investigation explored in-situ pulsed holography, holographic interferometry, and laser ablation divestment for applications in art conservation practice. During subsequent decades scores of UCSD graduate and undergraduate students as well as conservators, conservation scientists, academics, and engineers who resided in CASS as ""Visiting Scholars"" contributed to advancing the understanding and performance of radiation technologies in the arts. Several technologies in addition to those involving optical wavelengths were also investigated to aid in art conservation and conservation science. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were employed to detect and map moisture within masonry. Lead isotopic analyses revealed authenticity and provenance of Benin bronzes. Inside-out x-ray radiography facilitated the detection of defects in stone. Ultrasonic imaging was introduced for the mapping of fresco strata. Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS) was used to characterize varnish layers on paintings. Digital image processing was introduced in order to detect and visualize pentimenti within paintings as well as to perform virtual restoration and provide interactive museum displays. Holographic images were employed as imaginary theater sets. In the years that followed the graduation of students and the visits of professional collaborators, numerous other applications of radiation ablation began appearing in a wide variety of other fields such as aircraft maintenance, ship maintenance, toxic chemical remediation, biological sterilization, food processing, industrial fabrication, industrial maintenance, nuclear decontamination, dermatology, nuclear weapons effects simulation, and graffiti control. It was readily apparent that the customary diffusion of advanced technologies from science and industry into the art conservation field had been reversed. In this paper we trace the migration and adaptation of radiation divestment developments in art conservation to numerous applications in science, industry, and consumer products. Examples described include the robotized hybrid ""Flashjet"" aircraft paint stripping system, the ""Novotronic"" anthrax remediation installation in the Pentagon Building, the InTa automated graffiti removal system employing a carbon dioxide TEA laser, the Bellalite body hair removal product incorporating flashlamp technology, and the Foodco line of optical radiation products for the sterilization of food products. The Foodco products are also applied to the sterilization and/or pasteurization of beverages and beverage containers. A similar device has been adapted to seafood irradiation in order to increase shelf life, as well as for the ablative removal of skin and scales. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, to etch logos and identification information into the sidewalls of pneumatic tires, also developed a flashlamp-based ablation technology. The founders of the CYMER Corporation applied UV irradiation technology to the manufacture of high-performance integrated circuits (viz., memory chips, etc.) In several instances former CASS students and Visiting Fellows consciously adapted the above-learned art conservation methodologies to still other purposes. Thus, these examples of technology transfer may be termed: ""Art in the service of Science."" Alternatively, it is evident that many associated innovations developed from independent activities, unconnected serendipity, or through the normal diffusion of information and knowledge across disciplines. © 2013 SPIE.","Anthrax; Decontamination; Flashlamp; Food processing; Laser ablation; Marine technology; Sterilization","Anthrax; Flash lamp; Goodyear tire and rubbers; High-performance integrated circuits; Industrial maintenance; Marine technology; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); University of California; Ablation; Aircraft; Aircraft control; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Consumer products; Decontamination; Diseases; Food processing; Food products; History; Holographic interferometry; Image processing; Industry; Laser ablation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Maintenance; Marine engineering; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear weapons; Office buildings; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Radiation effects; Shipbuilding; Sterilization (cleaning); Stripping (removal); Students; Technology transfer; Ultrasonic imaging; Radiation decontamination",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881122238

However, few studies have addressed photothermal safety of these devices which emit high-power laser pulses to generate rapid, selective, yet non-destructive heating of subsurface structures. Towards elucidation of laser-tissue interactions and factors of safety for photothermal injury, we have developed a three-dimensional numerical model including light propagation, heat transfer and thermal damage algorithms. Literature surveys were performed to identify appropriate optical properties and the range of device exposure levels implemented in prior in vivo studies. Initial simulations provided model validation against results from the literature. Simulations were then performed based on breast tissue with discrete blood vessels irradiated by a train of laser pulses (10 Hz) at 800 and 1064 nm. For a constant exposure level, increasing beam diameter from 0.2 to 2.0 cm led to a factor of 2.5 increase in subsurface heat generation rates. Our preliminary modeling results indicate that for a 10 second tissue exposure under standard photoacoustic imaging conditions, irradiance-based safety limits should provide a factor of safety of 6 or greater over exposure levels that induce thermal coagulation. Opticalthermal modeling represents a powerful tool for elucidating photothermal effects relevant to the safety and effectiveness of photoacoustic systems.© 2013 SPIE.","Laser safety; Laser-tissue interactions; Monte carlo modeling; Photoacoustics; Thermal damage","Light-tissue interaction; Medical Diagnostic Device; Monte Carlo modeling; Photo-acoustic imaging; Photoacoustic systems; Subsurface structures; Thermal damage; Three-dimensional numerical models; Blood vessels; Chemical detection; Computer simulation; Diagnosis; Laser pulses; Laser safety; Laser tissue interaction; Photoacoustic effect; Physiology; Safety factor; Sensors; Tissue",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881078049

There is no restriction on the wavelength band used by the imaging sensor. There are no empirical constants in the model presented here and the results are in agreement with and generalize previously published equations. The newly developed equations have been verified by numerical simulations and also yield the expected mean detection time for all limiting values of the input parameters.

The phase matrix elements of a RBC model computed with the IITM are compared with their counterparts computed with the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) method. As expected, the DDA results approach the II-TM results with an increase in the number of dipoles per incident wavelength. Computationally, the II-TM is faster than the DDA when multiple RBC orientations are considered. For a single orientation, the DDA is comparable with or even faster than the II-TM because the DDA efficiently converges for optically soft particles; however, the DDA method demands significantly more computer memory than the IITM. After the applicability of the II-TM is numerically confirmed, a comparison is conducted of the optical properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs and of normal and deformed RBCs. The spectral variations of RBCs' optical properties are investigated in the wavelength range from 0.25 to 1.0 ìm. Furthermore, the statistically averaged phase matrix of spheres and biconcave RBCs are compared.

A validation study comparing our homemade (HM) trainer vs the FLS trainer was performed. A literature search as well as a price comparison with other commercially available laparoscopic trainers is presented. Methods: The HM laparoscopic trainer was constructed using a prefabricated hard plastic frame with a vinyl plastic sheet affixed as the roof. A row of light-emitting diode lights and a charge-coupled device camera were mounted on the inside roof of the frame. Electrical wires were spliced to supply power to both the light-emitting diode lights and the camera. The charge-coupled device camera was connected to a liquid crystal display screen which was affixed directly across from the user. Subjects were prospectively randomized to perform the 5 tasks put forth by the McGill Inanimate System for Training and Evaluation of Laparoscopic Skills on both the HM trainer and the FLS trainer (pegboard transfer, pattern cut, placement of ligating loop, extracorporeal knot suture, and intracorporeal knot suture). Simple paired t test was performed to compare times between the trainers. Setting: The construction of the trainer and the validation study were performed at the Central Michigan University College of Medicine Department of Simulation. Participants: Subjects consisted of third- and fourth-year medical students (n = 30). Results: A laparoscopic trainer box was constructed and assembled in 2 hours. The HM trainer cost $309 representing a cost savings of $1371. Results of the validation study demonstrated no statistical difference in times to complete 3 out of the 5 tasks as well as no difference in total time to complete all 5 tasks (p value< 0.05).

Even the features of movement that drive adaptation are hotly debated, with some studies suggesting remapping of goal locations and others suggesting remapping of the movement vectors leading to goal locations. However, several previous motor learning studies and the multiplicity of the neural coding underlying visually guided reaching movements stand in contrast to this either/or debate on the modes of motor planning and adaptation. Here we hypothesize that, during visuomotor learning, the target location and movement vector of trained movements are separately remapped, and we propose a novel computational model for how motor plans based on these remappings are combined during the control of visually guided reaching in humans. To test this hypothesis, we designed a set of experimental manipulations that effectively dissociated the effects of remapping goal location and movement vector by examining the transfer of visuomotor adaptation to untrained movements and movement sequences throughout the workspace. The results reveal that (1) motor adaptation differentially remaps goal locations and movement vectors, and (2) separate motor plans based on these features are effectively averaged during motor execution. We then show that, without any free parameters, the computational model we developed for combining movement-vector-based and goal-location-based planning predicts nearly 90% of the variance in novel movement sequences, even when multiple attributes are simultaneously adapted, demonstrating for the first time the ability to predict how motor adaptation affects movement sequence planning. © 2013 the authors.",,"adaptation; adult; article; female; human; human experiment; movement (physiology); neurophysiology; priority journal; training; visual feedback; visuomotor coordination; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Biomechanics; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Eye Movements; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Goals; Humans; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Neurological; Motor Skills; Movement; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Space Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879293934

Although some imaging techniques allow BAT detection, there are currently no viable methods for continuous acquisition of BAT energy expenditure. We present a non-invasive technique for long term monitoring of BAT metabolism using microwave radiometry. Methods: A multilayer 3D computational model was created in HFSS™ with 1.5 mm skin, 3-10 mm subcutaneous fat, 200 mm muscle and a BAT region (2-6 cm3) located between fat and muscle. Based on this model, a log-spiral antenna was designed and optimized to maximize reception of thermal emissions from the target (BAT). The power absorption patterns calculated in HFSS™ were combined with simulated thermal distributions computed in COMSOL® to predict radiometric signal measured from an ultra-low-noise microwave radiometer. The power received by the antenna was characterized as a function of different levels of BAT metabolism under cold and noradrenergic stimulation. Results: The optimized frequency band was 1.5-2.2 GHz, with averaged antenna efficiency of 19%. The simulated power received by the radiometric antenna increased 2-9 mdBm (noradrenergic stimulus) and 4-15 mdBm (cold stimulus) corresponding to increased 15-fold BAT metabolism. Conclusions: Results demonstrated the ability to detect thermal radiation from small volumes (2-6 cm3) of BAT located up to 12 mm deep and to monitor small changes (0.5°C) in BAT metabolism. As such, the developed miniature radiometric antenna sensor appears suitable for non-invasive long term monitoring of BAT metabolism. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.","3D multiphysics modeling; Brown fat metabolism; log spiral antenna; microwave radiometry; noninvasive monitoring","Fat metabolism; Log spiral antennas; Microwave radiometry; Multi-physics modeling; Non-invasive monitoring; Frequency bands; Imaging techniques; Microwave devices; Microwaves; Muscle; Optimization; Physiology; Radiometry; Spiral antennas; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Metabolism",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878524598

Although PL is generally believed to be highly specific to the trained stimulus, a series of psychophysical studies have recently shown that training effects can transfer to untrained conditions under certain experimental protocols. In this article, we present a brain-inspired, neuromorphic computational model of the Where-What visuomotor pathways which successfully explains both the specificity and transfer of perceptual learning. The major architectural novelty is that each feature neuron has both sensory and motor inputs. The network of neurons is autonomously developed from experience, using a refined Hebbian-learning rule and lateral competition, which altogether result in neuronal recruitment. Our hypothesis is that certain paradigms of experiments trigger two-way (descending and ascending) off-task processes about the untrained condition which lead to recruitment of more neurons in lower feature representation areas as well as higher concept representation areas for the untrained condition, hence the transfer. We put forward a novel proposition that gated self-organization of the connections during the off-task processes accounts for the observed transfer effects.

This adaptation does not transfer interocularly, and apparently applies only to luminance, not color. One can adapt selectively to only some of the contours in a display, making only these contours temporarily invisible. For instance, a plaid comprises a vertical grating superimposed on a horizontal grating. If one first adapts to appropriate flickering vertical lines, the vertical components of the plaid disappears and it looks like a horizontal grating. Also, we simulated a Cornsweet (1970) edge, and we selectively adapted out the subjective and objective contours of a Kanisza (1976) subjective square. By temporarily removing edges, contour adaptation offers a new technique to study the role of visual edges, and it demonstrates how brightness information is concentrated in edges and propagates from them as it fills in surfaces. © 2013 ARVO.","Adaptation; Contour; Contrast; Filling-in; Luminance","afterimage; article; comparative study; contrast sensitivity; human; pattern recognition; physiology; psychophysics; vision; visual adaptation; Adaptation, Ocular; Afterimage; Contrast Sensitivity; Figural Aftereffect; Form Perception; Humans; Psychophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878356334

Background: Military teams often use game-based simulators on desktop computers to train squad-level procedures. A wearable computer interface that mimics the soldier's equipment was expected to provide better training through increased realism and immersion. Method: A heuristic usability evaluation and two experiments were conducted. Eight evaluators interacted with both wearable and desktop interfaces and completed a usability survey. The first experiment compared the training retention of the wearable interface with a desktop simulator and interactive training video. The second experiment compared the training transfer of the wearable and desktop simulators with a live training environment. Results: Results indicated the wearable interface was more difficult to use and elicited stronger symptoms of simulator sickness. There was no significant difference in training retention between the wearable, desktop, or interactive video training methods. The live training used in the second experiment provided superior training transfer than the simulator conditions, with no difference between the desktop and wearable. Conclusion: The wearable simulator interface did not provide better training than the desktop computer interface. It also had poorer usability and caused worse simulator sickness. Therefore, it was a less effective training tool. Application: This research illustrates the importance of conducting empirical evaluations of novel training technologies.

To demonstrate the applicability of optimal control theory for designing minimum energy charge-balanced input waveforms for single periodically-firing in vitro neurons from brain slices of Long-Evans rats. Approach. The method of control uses the phase model of a neuron and does not require prior knowledge of the neuron's biological details. The phase model of a neuron is a one-dimensional model that is characterized by the neuron's phase response curve (PRC), a sensitivity measure of the neuron to a stimulus applied at different points in its firing cycle. The PRC for each neuron is experimentally obtained by measuring the shift in phase due to a short-duration pulse injected into the periodically-firing neuron at various phase values. Based on the measured PRC, continuous-time, charge-balanced, minimum energy control waveforms have been designed to regulate the next firing time of the neuron upon application at the onset of an action potential. Main result. The designed waveforms can achieve the inter-spike-interval regulation for in vitro neurons with energy levels that are lower than those of conventional monophasic pulsatile inputs of past studies by at least an order of magnitude. They also provide the advantage of being charge-balanced. The energy efficiency of these waveforms is also shown by performing several supporting simulations that compare the performance of the designed waveforms against that of phase shuffled surrogate inputs, variants of the minimum energy waveforms obtained from suboptimal PRCs, as well as pulsatile stimuli that are applied at the point of maximum PRC. It was found that the minimum energy waveforms perform better than all other stimuli both in terms of control and in the amount of energy used. Specifically, it was seen that these charge-balanced waveforms use at least an order of magnitude less energy than conventional monophasic pulsatile stimuli. Significance. The significance of this work is that it uses concepts from the theory of optimal control and introduces a novel approach in designing minimum energy charge-balanced input waveforms for neurons that are robust to noise and implementable in electrophysiological experiments. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Action potentials; Continuous-time; Minimum energy control; One-dimensional model; Optimal control theory; Optimal controls; Phase response curves; Sensitivity measures; Control; Electrophysiology; Energy efficiency; Neurons; action potential; animal tissue; article; brain slice; energy; in vitro study; nerve cell; nonhuman; phase response curve; plots and curves; priority journal; pyramidal nerve cell; rat; waveform; Action Potentials; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Computer Simulation; Electric Stimulation; Energy Transfer; Feedback, Physiological; Models, Neurological; Pyramidal Cells; Rats, Long-Evans; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878293882

In practice, proposed PMR methods have not been able to identify well-supported associations in GWAS that are undetectable by standard association tests and thus these methods are not widely applied. Here, we present a combined algorithmic and heuristic framework for PUMA (Penalized Unified Multiple-locus Association) analysis that solves the problems of previously proposed methods including computational speed, poor performance on genome-scale simulated data, and identification of too many associations for real data to be biologically plausible. The framework includes a new minorize-maximization (MM) algorithm for generalized linear models (GLM) combined with heuristic model selection and testing methods for identification of robust associations. The PUMA framework implements the penalized maximum likelihood penalties previously proposed for GWAS analysis (i.e. Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, NEG, MCP), as well as a penalty that has not been previously applied to GWAS (i.e. LOG). Using simulations that closely mirror real GWAS data, we show that our framework has high performance and reliably increases power to detect weak associations, while existing PMR methods can perform worse than single marker testing in overall performance. To demonstrate the empirical value of PUMA, we analyzed GWAS data for type 1 diabetes, Crohns's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, three autoimmune diseases from the original Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our analysis replicates known associations for these diseases and we discover novel etiologically relevant susceptibility loci that are invisible to standard single marker tests, including six novel associations implicating genes involved in pancreatic function, insulin pathways and immune-cell function in type 1 diabetes; three novel associations implicating genes in pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in Crohn's disease; and one novel association implicating a gene involved in apoptosis pathways in rheumatoid arthritis.

Although it was widely thought that Toxoplasma entry is parasite directed and that the host cell is largely a passive victim, recent studies have suggested that host components such as microfilaments and microtubules indeed contribute to entry. Hence to identify additional host factors, we performed a high-throughput siRNA screen of a human siRNA library targeting druggable proteins using a novel inducible luciferase based invasion assay. The top 100 hits from the primary screen that showed the strongest decreases in invasion were subjected to confirmation by secondary screening, revealing 24 proteins that are potentially involved in Toxoplasma entry into host cells. Interestingly, 6 of the hits appear to affect parasite invasion by modifying host cell actin dynamics, resulting in increased deposition of F-actin at the periphery of the cell. These findings support the emerging notion that host actin dynamics are important for Toxoplasma invasion along with identifying several novel host factors that potentially participate in parasite entry. © 2013 Gaji et al.",,"actin; F actin; mitogen activated protein kinase 7; myosin light chain; peptidylprolyl isomerase; polo like kinase 1; receptor like protein tyrosine phosphatase; small interfering RNA; article; cell invasion; cell transfer; cell viability; controlled study; gene silencing; high throughput screening; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; nucleotide sequence; parasite cultivation; parasite identification; process optimization; protein localization; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription; RNA interference; Toxoplasma gondii; toxoplasmosis; Actin Cytoskeleton; Actins; Genes, Reporter; HeLa Cells; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Host-Parasite Interactions; Humans; Luciferases; Microtubules; RNA, Small Interfering; Toxoplasma; Toxoplasma; Toxoplasma gondii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878594159

The results of simulating two distinct car-following scenarios illustrate that in-vehicle interaction by one driver can have significant downstream effects on other drivers, especially with respect to speed deviations relative to a lead vehicle.

Diffusion of these resources leads to long-range intercellular interactions, creating the possibility of cooperation but also the risk of exploitation by non-producing neighbors. In the past, considerable attention has been given to game-theoretic lattice models of intercellular cooperation. In these models, coexistence is commonly observed between cooperators (corresponding to resource producers) and cheaters (corresponding to nonproducers). However, these models consider only interactions between direct competitors. We find that when individuals are allowed to interact non-locally through the diffusion of a shared resource coexistence between cooperators and cheaters is lost. Instead, we find population dynamics similar to simple competition, either neutral or biased, with no balancing selection that would favor coexistence. Our results highlight the importance of an accurate treatment of diffusion of shared resources and argue against the generality of the conclusions of game-theoretic lattice models. © 2013 Borenstein et al.",,"analytical parameters; article; biofilm; cell division; cell interaction; cellular parameters; controlled study; diffusion; lattice model; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; population dynamics; probability; symbiosis; biological model; cell communication; computer simulation; game; organismal interaction; physiology; secretion (process); biological factor; Biological Factors; Cell Communication; Computer Simulation; Game Theory; Microbial Interactions; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877862264

As one of the traditional family-based studies, the Transmission/Disequilibrium Test (TDT) measures the over-transmission of an allele in a trio from its heterozygous parents to the affected offspring and can be potentially useful to identify genetic determinants for complex disorders. However, there is reduced information when complete trio information is unavailable. In this study, we developed a novel approach to ""infer"" the transmission of SNPs by combining both the linkage and association data, which uses microsatellite markers from families informative for linkage together with SNP markers from the offspring who are genotyped for both linkage and a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). We generalized the traditional TDT to process these inferred dosage probabilities, which we name as the dosage-TDT (dTDT). For evaluation purpose, we developed a simulation procedure to assess its operating characteristics. We applied the dTDT to the simulated data and documented the power of the dTDT under a number of different realistic scenarios.

We propose that this spectacular performance arises from encoding motor commands in terms of dynamic primitives. We propose three primitives as a foundation for a comprehensive theoretical framework that can embrace a wide range of upper- and lower-limb behaviors. Building on previous work that suggested discrete and rhythmic movements as elementary dynamic behaviors, we define submovements and oscillations: As discrete movements cannot be combined with sufficient flexibility, we argue that suitably-defined submovements are primitives. As the term ""rhythmic may be ambiguous, we define oscillations as the corresponding class of primitives. We further propose mechanical impedances as a third class of dynamic primitives, necessary for interaction with the physical environment. Combination of these three classes of primitive requires care. One approach is through a generalized equivalent network: a virtual trajectory composed of simultaneous and/or sequential submovements and/or oscillations that interacts with mechanical impedances to produce observable forces and motions. Reliable experimental identification of these dynamic primitives presents challenges: Identification of mechanical impedances is exquisitely sensitive to assumptions about their dynamic structure; identification of submovements and oscillations is sensitive to their assumed form and to details of the algorithm used to extract them. Some methods to address these challenges are presented. Some implications of this theoretical framework for locomotor rehabilitation are considered. © 2013 Hogan and Sternad.","Discrete; Impedance; Locomotion; Oscillation; Primitive; Rehabilitation; Rhythmic; Submovement","Discrete; Oscillation; Primitive; Rhythmic; Submovements; Biped locomotion; Electric impedance; Patient rehabilitation; Robots; Dynamics; algorithm; article; computer network; conceptual framework; impedance; limb movement; locomotion; motor control; motor performance; muscle function; oscillation; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877749875

The goal of this article is to develop a multiscale adaptive generalized estimation equation (MAGEE) method for spatial and adaptive analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. MAGEE is applicable to making statistical inference on regression coefficients in both balanced and unbalanced longitudinal designs and even in twin and familial studies, whereas standard software platforms have several major limitations in handling these complex studies. Specifically, conventional voxel-based analyses in these software platforms involve Gaussian smoothing imaging data and then independently fitting a statistical model at each voxel. However, the conventional smoothing methods suffer from the lack of spatial adaptivity to the shape and spatial extent of region of interest and the arbitrary choice of smoothing extent, while independently fitting statistical models across voxels does not account for the spatial properties of imaging observations and noise distribution. To address such drawbacks, we adapt a powerful propagation-separation (PS) procedure to sequentially incorporate the neighboring information of each voxel and develop a new novel strategy to solely update a set of parameters of interest, while fixing other nuisance parameters at their initial estimators. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that MAGEE significantly outperforms voxel-based analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Gaussian smoothing; Generalized estimation equation; Hypothesis; Longitudinal studies; Multiscale adaptive; Voxel-based analysis","article; calculation; computer analysis; data analysis; image analysis; longitudinal study; mathematical computing; neuroimaging; priority journal; process development; regression analysis; simulation; statistical model; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Neuroimaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873723896

The relay helix plays a critical role in force generation in myosin, coupling biochemical changes in the ATPase site with the force-transducing rotation of the myosin light-chain domain. Previous research in the absence of actin showed that ATP binding to myosin induces a dynamic equilibrium between a bent prepower stroke state of the relay helix and a straight postpower stroke state, which dominates in the absence of ATP or when ADP is bound. We now ask whether actin binding reverses this transition and if so, how this reversal is coordinated with actin-activated phosphate release. We labeled a Cys-lite Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain with donor and acceptor probes at two engineered Cys residues designed to detect relay helix bending. We then performed transient time-resolved FRET following stopped-flow mixing of actin with labeled myosin, preincubated with ATP. We determined the kinetics of actin-activated phosphate release, using fluorescent phosphate-binding protein. The results show that actin binding to the myosin.ADP.P complex straightens the relay helix before phosphate dissociation. This actin-activated relay helix straightening is reversible, but phosphate irreversibly dissociates from the postpower stroke state, preventing reversal of the power stroke. Thus, relay helix straightening gates phosphate dissociation, whereas phosphate dissociation provides the thermodynamic driving force underlying force production.","Muscle; Structural kinetics; Time-resolved FRET","actin; adenosine triphosphate; cysteine; myosin; myosin II; phosphate binding protein; article; controlled study; enzyme kinetics; enzyme release; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; priority journal; protein analysis; protein binding; protein domain; protein structure; thermodynamics; Actins; Animals; Biomechanics; Catalytic Domain; Computer Systems; Crystallography, X-Ray; Dictyostelium; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Kinetics; Myosin Type II; Phosphates; Protein Structure, Secondary; Rabbits; Time Factors; Dictyostelium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876890444

The advantages of cooperation over individuality seem well known but it is not clear yet how such increase of complexity emerged from unicellular life forms. Current multicellular systems display a complex cell-cell communication machinery, often tied to large-scale controls of body size or tissue homeostasis. Some unicellular life forms are simpler and involve groups of cells cooperating in a tissue-like fashion, as it occurs with biofilms. However, before true gene regulatory interactions were widespread and allowed for controlled changes in cell phenotypes, simple cellular colonies displaying adhesion and interacting with their environments were in place. In this context, models often ignore the physical embedding of evolving cells, thus leaving aside a key component. The potential for evolving pre-developmental patterns is a relevant issue: how far a colony of evolving cells can go? Here we study these pre-conditions for morphogenesis by using CHIMERA, a physically embodied computational model of evolving virtual organisms in a pre-Mendelian world. Starting from a population of identical, independent cells moving in a fluid, the system undergoes a series of changes, from spatial segregation, increased adhesion and the development of generalism. Eventually, a major transition occurs where a change in the flow of nutrients is triggered by a sub-population. This ecosystem engineering phenomenon leads to a subsequent separation of the ecological network into two well defined compartments. The relevance of these results for evodevo and its potential ecological triggers is discussed. © 2013 Solé, Valverde.",,"article; cell activity; cell aggregation; cell maturation; cell transformation; evolutionary developmental biology; mathematical computing; mathematical model; morphogenesis; Algorithms; Biological Evolution; Cell Communication; Cell Physiological Phenomena; Computer Simulation; Environment; Models, Theoretical; Morphogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876170005

We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.",,"algorithm; article; computer system; human; Internet; polarization; population dynamics; priority journal; social interaction; social network; social psychology; Acculturation; Algorithms; Attitude; Computer Simulation; Humans; Internet; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Prejudice; Social Behavior; Social Support",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876046902

In sensory systems, divisive normalization seems to be a canonical neural computation, observed in areas ranging from retina to cortex and mediating processes including contrast adaptation, surround suppression, visual attention, and multisensory integration. Recent electrophysiological studies have extended these insights beyond the sensory domain, demonstrating an analogous algorithm for the value signals that guide decision making, but the effects of normalization on choice behavior are unknown. Here, we show that choice models using normalization generate significant (and classically irrational) choice phenomena driven by either the value or number of alternative options. In value-guided choice experiments, both monkey and human choosers show novel context-dependent behavior consistent with normalization. These findings suggest that the neural mechanism of value coding critically influences stochastic choice behavior and provide a generalizable quantitative framework for examining context effects in decision making.","Context dependence; Divisive normalization; Neural coding; Neuroeconomics; Reward","adaptation; adult; article; behavior; brain function; conceptual framework; correlation analysis; decision making; female; Haplorhini; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; stochastic model; task performance; Algorithms; Animals; Brain; Brain Mapping; Choice Behavior; Computer Simulation; Decision Making; Haplorhini; Humans; Models, Neurological; Normal Distribution; Regression Analysis; Reward",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876067951

Background: To our knowledge, no definitive studies have actually shown that implicit learning plays a causal role in the development of intuitive decision making when the latter is defined as pattern recognition of real-world, or simulated real-world, environmental situations. Method: The simulated environment was presented dynamically so as to induce a sense of simulated locomotion through the scene and over sequences of objects on the ground. During training, participants passively viewed the objects sequences; during test, participants made intuitive decisions about related or unrelated sequences. Results: Intuitive decision making can be developed via implicit learning. Articulatory suppression, which affects working memory, exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the training of intuitive decision making. Intuitive decision making trained in the simulated environment fully transferred to a flat display (but not vice versa). Conclusion: Intuitive decision making is developed by an implicit learning process that is engaged by the meaning inherent in naturalistic scenes.

This works by optimally driving the neurons to their phaseless sets, switching the control off, and letting the phases of the neurons randomize under intrinsic background noise. An event-based minimum energy input may be clinically desirable for deep brain stimulation treatment of neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease. The event-based nature of the input results in its administration only when it is necessary, which, in general, amounts to fewer applications, and hence, less charge transfer to and from the tissue. The minimum energy nature of the input may also help prolong battery life for implanted stimulus generators. For the example considered, it is shown that the proposed control causes a considerable amount of randomization in the timing of each neuron's next spike, leading to desynchronization for the network. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Desynchronization; Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE; Hodgkin-Huxley neuron; Optimal control","action potential; article; brain depth stimulation; controlled study; electric battery; energy transfer; event based minimum energy desynchronizing control stimulus; evoked response; general medical device; mathematical model; nerve cell network; nerve cell stimulation; noise; optimal control theory; Parkinson disease; priority journal; randomization; theory; Action Potentials; Animals; Biological Clocks; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879686858

First, the unsuppressed water signal can be used as internal calibration for metabolite quantification and as a reliable frequency/phase reference for retrospective motion correction. Second, it avoids the potential artifacts caused by incomplete water suppression (WS) and extra radiofrequency deposition from WS pulses. However, the frequency modulation (FM) sidebands originating from a large water signal will distort the spectrum. Among the methods proposed to solve the problems caused by FM sidebands, post-acquisition processing methods are superior in flexibility for general use compared with experimental methods. In this study, we propose two algorithms based on advanced matrix decomposition to remove the FM sidebands. These methods, the simultaneous diagonalization (QZ) algorithm and its subsequent variant, the simultaneously generalized Schur decomposition (SGSD) algorithm, were numerically evaluated using computer simulations. In addition, we quantitatively compared the performance of these methods and the modulus method in an in vitro experiment and in vivo NWS MRS against conventional WS data. Our results show that the proposed SGSD algorithm can reduce the FM sidebands to achieve superior estimation of concentration on three major metabolites. This method can be applied directly to spectra pre-acquired under various experimental conditions without modifying the acquisition sequences.

Background: The hand activity level (HAL) is widely used for evaluating repetitive hand work. Conventional methods involving either a trained observer on- or off-site or manual off-site video analysis are often considered inaccurate, cumbersome, or impractical for routine work assessment. Method: A cross-correlation-based template-matching algorithm was programmed to track the motion trajectory of a selected region of interest across successive video frames for a single camera to measure repetition frequency, duty cycle, and HAL. A simple, paced, load transfer task was used to simulate a repetitive industrial activity. A total of 12 participants were videoed performing the task for varying HAL conditions. The automatically predicted HAL was compared with the manually measured HAL with the use of frame-by-frame video analysis. Results: Predicted frequency, duty cycle, and HAL were in concert with the manually measured HAL conditions. The linear regression slopes of the automatically predicted values with respect to the manually measured values were 0.98 (R2 = .79), 1.27 (R 2 = .63), and 1.06 (R2 = .77) for frequency, duty cycle, and HAL, respectively. Conclusion: A proof-of-concept for automatic video-based direct exposure assessment was demonstrated. Application: The video assessment method for repetitive motion is promising for automatic, unobtrusive, and objective exposure assessment, which may offer broad availability with the use of a camera-enabled mobile device for helping evaluate, prevent, and control exposure to repetitive motions related to upper-extremity injuries in the workplace.

However, the complexity of many behaviors can handicap the interpretation of such models. Here we provide perspectives on problems that can arise when interpreting parameter fits from models that provide incomplete descriptions of behavior. We illustrate these problems by fitting commonly used and neurophysiologically motivated reinforcement-learning models to simulated behavioral data sets from learning tasks. These model fits can pass a host of standard goodness-of-fit tests and other model-selection diagnostics even when the models do not provide a complete description of the behavioral data. We show that such incomplete models can be misleading by yielding biased estimates of the parameters explicitly included in the models. This problem is particularly pernicious when the neglected factors are unknown and therefore not easily identified by model comparisons and similar methods. An obvious conclusion is that a parsimonious description of behavioral data does not necessarily imply an accurate description of the underlying computations. Moreover, general goodness-of-fit measures are not a strong basis to support claims that a particular model can provide a generalized understanding of the computations that govern behavior. To help overcome these challenges, we advocate the design of tasks that provide direct reports of the computational variables of interest. Such direct reports complement model-fitting approaches by providing a more complete, albeit possibly more task-specific, representation of the factors that drive behavior. Computational models then provide a means to connect such task-specific results to a more general algorithmic understanding of the brain. © 2013 Nassar, Gold.",,"accuracy; analytical error; article; behavior; classification algorithm; human; intermethod comparison; learning theory; mathematical computing; mathematical model; neuroscience; process design; task performance; Algorithms; Behavior; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Learning; Models, Psychological; Motivation; Neurosciences; Problem Solving; Reinforcement (Psychology)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876943382

We numerically study two individual-based models, which recent empirical studies have suggested to explain self-organized group animal behavior: (i) a zone-based model where the group communication topology is determined by finite interacting zones of repulsion, attraction, and orientation among individuals; and (ii) a model where the communication topology is described by Delaunay triangulation, which is defined by each individual's Voronoi neighbors. The models include a tunable parameter that controls an individual's relative weighting of attraction and alignment. We perform computational experiments to investigate how effectively simulated groups transfer information in the form of velocity when an individual is perturbed. A cross-correlation function is used to measure the sensitivity of groups to sudden perturbations in the heading of individual members. The results show how relative weighting of attraction and alignment, location of the perturbed individual, population size, and the communication topology affect group structure and response to perturbation. We find that in the Delaunay-based model an individual who is perturbed is capable of triggering a cascade of responses, ultimately leading to the group changing direction. This phenomenon has been seen in self-organized animal groups in both experiments and nature. © 2013 Kolpas et al.",,"animal behavior; article; controlled study; empiricism; mathematical computing; mathematical model; polarization; population size; population structure; probability; sensitivity analysis; social interaction; spatial analysis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Birds; Models, Biological; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875347747

To achieve an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the representation of tactile stimuli in the nerve, we developed a two-stage computational model consisting of a nonlinear mechanical transduction stage followed by a generalized integrate-and-fire mechanism. The model improves upon a recently published counterpart in two important ways. First, complexity is dramatically reduced (at least one order of magnitude fewer parameters). Second, the model comprises a saturating nonlinearity and therefore can be applied to a much wider range of stimuli. We show that both the rate and timing of afferent responses are predicted with remarkable precision and that observed adaptation patterns and threshold behavior are well captured. We conclude that the responses of mechanoreceptive afferents can be understood using a very parsimonious mechanistic model, which can then be used to accurately simulate the responses of afferent populations. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.","Computational model; Expectation minimization; Integrate-and-fire neurons; Mechanoreceptive afferents; Pacinian afferents; Primate; RA; SA; Somatosensory perception","adaptation; analytic method; animal cell; article; glabrous skin; mechanical stimulation; mechanoreceptor; mechanotransduction; nonhuman; nonlinear system; priority journal; rhesus monkey; sensory nerve; tactile stimulation; Action Potentials; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Macaca mulatta; Mechanoreceptors; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Models, Neurological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Reaction Time; Sensory Thresholds; Skin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874622051

For threshold studies, the fitted functions are called psychometric functions. While fitting psychometric functions to data acquired using adaptive sampling procedures (e.g., ""staircase"" procedures), investigators have encountered a bias in the spread (""slope"" or ""threshold"") parameter that has been attributed to the serial dependency of the adaptive data. Using simulations, we confirm this bias for cumulative Gaussian parametric maximum likelihood fits on data collected via adaptive sampling procedures, and then present a bias-reduced maximum likelihood fit that substantially reduces the bias without reducing the precision of the spread parameter estimate and without reducing the accuracy or precision of the other fit parameters. As a separate topic, we explain how to implement this bias reduction technique using generalized linear model fits as well as other numeric maximum likelihood techniques such as the Nelder-Mead simplex. We then provide a comparison of the iterative bootstrap and observed information matrix techniques for estimating parameter fit variance from adaptive sampling procedure data sets. The iterative bootstrap technique is shown to be slightly more accurate; however, the observed information technique executes in a small fraction (0.005 %) of the time required by the iterative bootstrap technique, which is an advantage when a real-time estimate of parameter fit variance is required. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Generalized linear models; GLM; Maximum likelihood estimation; Psychophysics; Threshold; Vestibular","accuracy; adaptive sampling; article; bootstrapping; maximum likelihood method; normal distribution; priority journal; psychometry; sampling; signal detection; simulation; systematic error; vestibular function; Algorithms; Bias (Epidemiology); Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Linear Models; Normal Distribution; Perception; Psychometrics; Psychophysics; Sensory Thresholds; Signal Detection, Psychological; Vestibule, Labyrinth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877024624

In the brain, for example, axonal delays between brain areas can amount to several tens of milliseconds, adding an intrinsic component to any timing-based processing of information. Inferring neural interaction delays is thus needed to interpret the information transfer revealed by any analysis of directed interactions across brain structures. However, a robust estimation of interaction delays from neural activity faces several challenges if modeling assumptions on interaction mechanisms are wrong or cannot be made. Here, we propose a robust estimator for neuronal interaction delays rooted in an information-theoretic framework, which allows a model-free exploration of interactions. In particular, we extend transfer entropy to account for delayed source-target interactions, while crucially retaining the conditioning on the embedded target state at the immediately previous time step. We prove that this particular extension is indeed guaranteed to identify interaction delays between two coupled systems and is the only relevant option in keeping with Wiener's principle of causality. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in detecting interaction delays on finite data by numerical simulations of stochastic and deterministic processes, as well as on local field potential recordings. We also show the ability of the extended transfer entropy to detect the presence of multiple delays, as well as feedback loops. While evaluated on neuroscience data, we expect the estimator to be useful in other fields dealing with network dynamics. © 2013 Wibral et al.",,"article; data analysis; entropy; feedback system; mathematical computing; nerve cell network; nerve conduction; neuroscience; probability; simulation; Algorithms; Animals; Brain; Computer Simulation; Electroretinography; Humans; Information Theory; Models, Neurological; Neural Conduction; Neurons; Retina; Synaptic Transmission; Turtles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874522295

Phylogenies attempt to answer an important question posed in biology: what are the ancestor-descendent relationships between organisms? At the core of every biological problem lies a phylogenetic component. The patterns that can be observed in nature are the product of complex interactions, constrained by the template that our ancestors provide. The problem of simultaneous tree and alignment estimation under Maximum Parsimony is known in combinatorial optimization as the Generalized Tree Alignment Problem (GTAP). The GTAP is the Steiner Tree Problem for the sequence edit distance. Like many biologically interesting problems, the GTAP is NP-Hard. Typically the Steiner Tree is presented under the Manhattan or the Hamming distances.Results: Experimentally, the accuracy of the GTAP has been subjected to evaluation. Results show that phylogenies selected using the GTAP from unaligned sequences are competitive with the best methods and algorithms available. Here, we implement and explore experimentally existing and new local search heuristics for the GTAP using simulated and real data.Conclusions: The methods presented here improve by more than three orders of magnitude in execution time the best local search heuristics existing to date when applied to real data. © 2013 Varón and Wheeler; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Direct optimization; Phylogeny; Sequence alignment; Tree alignment; Tree search","Direct optimization; Phylogeny; Sequence alignments; Tree alignment; Tree search; Alignment; Binary trees; Combinatorial optimization; Trees (mathematics); Biology; algorithm; article; methodology; phylogeny; sequence alignment; Algorithms; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874206648

A major challenge in developing these systems arises from the large individual differences typically seen in the neural/physiological responses. As a result, many researchers use individually-trained recognition algorithms to process this data. In order to minimize time, cost, and barriers to use, there is a need to minimize the amount of individual training data required, or equivalently, to increase the recognition accuracy without increasing the number of user-specific training samples. One promising method for achieving this is collaborative filtering, which combines training data from the individual subject with additional training data from other, similar subjects. This paper describes a successful application of a collaborative filtering approach intended for a BCI system. This approach is based on transfer learning (TL), active class selection (ACS), and a mean squared difference user-similarity heuristic. The resulting BCI system uses neural and physiological signals for automatic task difficulty recognition. TL improves the learning performance by combining a small number of user-specific training samples with a large number of auxiliary training samples from other similar subjects. ACS optimally selects the classes to generate user-specific training samples. Experimental results on 18 subjects, using both k nearest neighbors and support vector machine classifiers, demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the number of user-specific training data samples. This collaborative filtering approach will also be generalizable to handling individual differences in many other applications that involve human neural or physiological data, such as affective computing.",,"accuracy; active class selection; article; automated pattern recognition; brain computer interface; collaborative filtering; electroencephalogram; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; information processing; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; learning transfer; machine learning; process optimization; stimulus response; Stroop test; support vector machine; task performance; virtual reality; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Computer Systems; Cooperative Behavior; Electroencephalography; Humans; Learning; Male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874336966

Use of the code with the GUI is described and demonstrated. New physiological elements were added to the model to represent the hands and feet, including the unique vascular structures adapted for heat transfer associated with glabrous skin. The heat transfer function and efficacy of glabrous skin is unique within the entire body based on the capacity for a very high rate of blood perfusion and the novel capability for dynamic regulation of blood flow. The model was applied to quantify the absolute and relative contributions of glabrous skin flow to thermoregulation for varying levels of blood perfusion. The model also was used to demonstrate how the unique features of glabrous skin blood flow may be recruited to implement thermal therapeutic procedures. We have developed proprietary methods to manipulate the control of glabrous skin blood flow in conjunction with therapeutic devices and simulated the effect of these methods with the model. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","arteriovenous anastomoses; blood flow; computer simulation; core temperature; glabrous skin; therapeutic hypothermia; thermoregulation; Wissler model","arteriovenous anastomoses; Blood flow; Core temperature; Therapeutic hypothermias; thermoregulation; Blood; Graphical user interfaces; Heat transfer; Microcirculation; Physiological models; Computer simulation; arteriovenous fistula; article; computer interface; computer simulation; glabrous skin; heart perfusion; heat transfer; skin blood flow; skin temperature; thermoregulation; biological model; blood flow; computer language; human; male; physiology; skin; vascularization; Arteriovenous Anastomosis; Body Temperature Regulation; Computer Simulation; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Programming Languages; Regional Blood Flow; Skin; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873696138

The measure employed in these comparisons, ""spike-field coherence"", is a frequency dependent measure of linear association, and is shown to depend on overall neural activity (Lepage et al., 2011). Dependence upon overall neural activity, that is, dependence upon the total number of spikes, renders comparison of spike-field coherence across experimental context difficult. In this paper, an inferential procedure based upon a generalized linear model is shown to be capable of separating the effects of overall neural activity from spike train-LFP oscillatory coupling. This separation provides a means to compare the strength of oscillatory association between spike train-LFP pairs independent of differences in spike counts. Following a review of the generalized linear modelling framework of point process neural activity a specific class of generalized linear models are introduced. This model class, using either a piece-wise constant link function, or an exponential function to relate an LFP rhythm to neural response, is used to develop hypothesis tests capable of detecting changes in spike train-LFP oscillatory coupling. The performance of these tests is validated, both in simulation and on real data. The proposed method of inference provides a principled statistical procedure by which across-context change in spike train-LFP rhythmic association can be directly inferred that explicitly handles between-condition differences in total spike count. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Coherence; Generalized linear model; Hypothesis testing; Local field potential; Oscillations; Point process; Rhythms; Spike-field coherence; Spikes; Statistical association","article; conceptual framework; nerve cell; nerve potential; oscillation; priority journal; simulation; spike; validation study; Algorithms; Animals; Attention; Color Perception; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electrophysiology; Evoked Potentials; Linear Models; Macaca mulatta; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Cortex; Visual Fields",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872381010

Complications may arise during repeated attempts at placing the catheter in the ventricle. We studied the impact of simulation-based practice with a library of virtual brains on neurosurgery residents' performance in simulated and live surgical ventriculostomies. METHODS: Using computed tomographic scans of actual patients, we developed a library of 15 virtual brains for the ImmersiveTouch system, a head- and hand-tracked augmented reality and haptic simulator. The virtual brains represent a range of anatomies including normal, shifted, and compressed ventricles. Neurosurgery residents participated in individual simulator practice on the library of brains including visualizing the 3-dimensional location of the catheter within the brain immediately after each insertion. Performance of participants on novel brains in the simulator and during actual surgery before and after intervention was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: Simulator cannulation success rates increased after intervention, and live procedure outcomes showed improvement in the rate of successful cannulation on the first pass. However, the incidence of deeper, contralateral (simulator) and third-ventricle (live) placements increased after intervention. Residents reported that simulations were realistic and helpful in improving procedural skills such as aiming the probe, sensing the pressure change when entering the ventricle, and estimating how far the catheter should be advanced within the ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: Simulator practice with a library of virtual brains representing a range of anatomies and difficulty levels may improve performance, potentially decreasing complications due to inexpert technique.

Elucidating the functional logic of complex search algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this technique to the analysis of rapid turns (""saccades"") of freely flying Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions. The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data from genetic behavioral screens. © 2013 Censi et al.",,"animal behavior; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; decision making; Drosophila melanogaster; eye tracking; female; flying; male; mathematical model; movement perception; nonhuman; prediction; quantitative analysis; receptive field; saccadic eye movement; stimulus response; visual discrimination; visual orientation; visual stimulation; Algorithms; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Computational Biology; Decision Making; Drosophila melanogaster; Female; Flight, Animal; Models, Biological; Photic Stimulation; Saccades",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874777277

We compared 'unguided' SRL with 'directed' SRL (DSRL), wherein learners followed an expert-designed booklet. Methods Year1 medical students (n=37) were randomly assigned to practise identifying seven cardiac murmurs using a simulator and video only (SRL group) or a simulator and video plus the booklet (DSRL group). All participants completed a 22-item test 3weeks later. To compare interventions, we analysed students' diagnostic accuracy. As a novel source of evidence, we documented how participants autonomously sequenced the seven murmurs during initial and delayed practice sessions. In addition, we surveyed clinical educators (n=17) to find out how they would sequence their teaching of these murmurs. Results The DSRL group used 50% more training time than the SRL group (p<0.001). The groups' diagnostic accuracy, however, did not differ significantly on the post-test, retention test or transfer test items (p>0.12). Despite practising with the expert-defined 'timing-based' approach to murmur diagnosis (i.e. systolic versus diastolic), 84% of DSRL participants implemented a location-based approach (i.e. practising aortic murmurs separately from mitral murmurs) during a second, unguided practice session. Notably, most SRL participants used that same approach spontaneously. By contrast, clinical educators were split in their use of the timing-based (n=10) and the location-based (n=6) approaches. Chi-squared analyses suggested educators' conceptions for organising murmurs differed significantly from students' conceptions. Conclusions Contrary to our predictions, directing students' SRL produced no additional benefit and increased their practice time. Our findings suggest one potential source of these results was a divergence between student and educator conceptions for structuring the practice of cardiac auscultation skills. This phenomenon has not been well articulated in the medical education literature, and may have important implications in many (especially technology-mediated) educational contexts.

Their strong transient output affects cortical targets, rendering SWRs a possible means for memory transfer from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage. Neurophysiological observations of hippocampal activity modulation by the cortical slow oscillation (SO) during deep sleep and anesthesia, and correlations between ripples and UP states, support the role of SWRs in memory consolidation through a cortico-hippocampal feedback loop. We couple a cortical network exhibiting SO with a hippocampal CA3-CA1 computational network model exhibiting SWRs, in order to model such cortico-hippocampal correlations and uncover important parameters and coupling mechanisms controlling them. The cortical oscillatory output entrains the CA3 network via connections representing the mossy fiber input, and the CA1 network via the temporoammonic pathway. The spiking activity in CA3 and CA1 is shown to depend on the excitation-to-inhibition ratio, induced by combining the two hippocampal inputs, with mossy fiber input controlling the UP-state correlation of CA3 population bursts and corresponding SWRs, whereas the temporoammonic input affects the overall CA1 spiking activity. Ripple characteristics and pyramidal spiking participation to SWRs are shaped by the strength of the Schaffer collateral drive.

For each pair in a collection of non-essential genes, an epistasis score is obtained, representing how much sicker (or healthier) the double-knockout organism will be compared to what would be expected from the sickness of the component single knockouts. Recent algorithmic work has identified graph-theoretic patterns in this data that can indicate functional modules, and even sets of genes that may occur in compensatory pathways, such as a BPM-type schema first introduced by Kelley and Ideker. However, to date, any algorithms for finding such patterns in the data were implemented internally, with no software being made publically available.Results: Genecentric is a new package that implements a parallelized version of the Leiserson et al. algorithm (J Comput Biol 18:1399-1409, 2011) for generating generalized BPMs from high-throughput genetic interaction data. Given a matrix of weighted epistasis values for a set of double knock-outs, Genecentric returns a list of generalized BPMs that may represent compensatory pathways. Genecentric also has an extension, GenecentricGO, to query FuncAssociate (Bioinformatics 25:3043-3044, 2009) to retrieve GO enrichment statistics on generated BPMs. Python is the only dependency, and our web site provides working examples and documentation.Conclusion: We find that Genecentric can be used to find coherent functional and perhaps compensatory gene sets from high throughput genetic interaction data.

In contrast, a generalized linear model (GLM) is very interpretable especially when forward feature selection is used to construct the model. However, forward feature selection tends to overfit the data and leads to low predictive accuracy. Therefore, it remains an important research goal to combine the advantages of ensemble predictors (high accuracy) with the advantages of forward regression modeling (interpretability). To address this goal several articles have explored GLM based ensemble predictors. Since limited evaluations suggested that these ensemble predictors were less accurate than alternative predictors, they have found little attention in the literature.Results: Comprehensive evaluations involving hundreds of genomic data sets, the UCI machine learning benchmark data, and simulations are used to give GLM based ensemble predictors a new and careful look. A novel bootstrap aggregated (bagged) GLM predictor that incorporates several elements of randomness and instability (random subspace method, optional interaction terms, forward variable selection) often outperforms a host of alternative prediction methods including random forests and penalized regression models (ridge regression, elastic net, lasso). This random generalized linear model (RGLM) predictor provides variable importance measures that can be used to define a "" thinned"" ensemble predictor (involving few features) that retains excellent predictive accuracy.Conclusion: RGLM is a state of the art predictor that shares the advantages of a random forest (excellent predictive accuracy, feature importance measures, out-of-bag estimates of accuracy) with those of a forward selected generalized linear model (interpretability). These methods are implemented in the freely available R software package randomGLM. © 2013 Song et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Comprehensive evaluation; Forward feature selections; Forward regression; Generalized linear model; Prediction methods; Predictive accuracy; Random subspace method; Variable importances; Regression analysis; Decision trees; animal; article; artificial intelligence; computer program; diseases; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; human; methodology; mouse; regression analysis; statistical model; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Disease; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Linear Models; Mice; Regression Analysis; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872177797

Their duration is too short for the visual system to be able to follow their progress in time. Adaptive mechanisms constantly recalibrate the saccadic responses by detecting how close the landings are to the selected targets. The double-step saccadic paradigm is a common method to simulate alterations in saccadic gain. While the subject is responding to a first target shift, a second shift is introduced in the middle of this movement, which masks it from visual detection. The error in landing introduced by the second shift is interpreted by the brain as an error in the programming of the initial response, with gradual gain changes aimed at compensating the apparent sensorimotor mismatch. A second shift applied dichoptically to only one eye introduces disconjugate landing errors between the two eyes. A monocular adaptive system would independently modify only the gain of the eye exposed to the second shift in order to reestablish binocular alignment. Our results support a binocular mechanism. A version-based saccadic adaptive process detects postsaccadic version errors and generates compensatory conjugate gain alterations. A vergence-based saccadic adaptive process detects postsaccadic disparity errors and generates corrective nonvisual disparity signals that are sent to the vergence system to regain binocularity. This results in striking dynamical similarities between visually driven combined saccade-vergence gaze transfers, where the disparity is given by the visual targets, and the double-step adaptive disconjugate responses, where an adaptive disparity signal is generated internally by the saccadic system. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.","Adaptation; Disparity; Saccade; Strabismus; Vergence","adaptation; analytical error; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; article; binocular convergence; binocular vision; brain nerve cell; brain stem; cerebellum; controlled study; gaze; nonhuman; oscillation; priority journal; rhesus monkey; saccadic eye movement; sensorimotor function; vision; visual stimulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Macaca mulatta; Saccades; Vision Disparity; Vision, Binocular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872398488

A treadmill-slip training group (Group A, n=17) initially experienced repeated perturbations on treadmill intended to simulate forward-slip in over-ground walking. Perturbation continued and its intensity reduced when necessary to ensure subjects' successful adaptation (i.e., when they could land their trailing foot ahead of the slipping foot in at least 3 of 5 consecutive trials). They then experienced a novel slip during over-ground walking. Another 17 young adults in Group B experienced an identical novel slip that served as the controls. They then underwent more slip trials during over-ground walking. Their 16th slip trial was analyzed to represent the over-ground-slip training effect. Eight subjects (47%) in Group A fell upon their first treadmill slip, while all adapted successfully after a minimum of 15 slip trials. Upon the novel slip during over-ground walking, none of them fell in comparison to four subjects (23.5%) fell in Group B upon the same trial (p<0.05). Group A's control of stability, both proactive and reactive, was significantly better than that of Group B's on their first over-ground slip, while the level of improvement in the control of stability derived from indirect treadmill training was not as strong as that from direct over-ground-slip training, as demonstrated in Group B's 16th slip trial (p<0.001). These results clearly demonstrated the feasibility of fall reduction through treadmill-slip training. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Motor program; Perturbation; Spatial transfer; Stability control","Fall reductions; Motor programs; Perturbation; Repeated perturbation; Spatial transfer; Stability control; Training effects; Treadmill training; Sporting goods; Exercise equipment; accident prevention; adult; article; body equilibrium; controlled study; exercise intensity; fall risk; falling; feasibility study; female; human; intermethod comparison; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; simulation; therapy effect; treadmill; treadmill exercise; treadmill slip training; walking; Accidental Falls; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Walking; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871418398

Whereas such perturbations are useful for studying how the central nervous system adapts and generalizes to novel dynamics, they are rarely encountered in daily life. The most common perturbations that we experience are changes in the weights of objects that we hold. Here, we use a center-out, free-reaching task, in which we can manipulate the weight of a participant's hand to examine adaptation and generalization following naturalistic perturbations. In both trial-by-trial paradigms and block-based paradigms, we find that learning converges rapidly (on a timescale of approximately two trials), and this learning generalizes mostly to movements in nearby directions with a unimodal pattern. However, contrary to studies using more artificial perturbations, we find that the generalization has a strong global component. Furthermore, the generalization is enhanced with repeated exposure of the same perturbation. These results suggest that the familiarity of a perturbation is a major factor in movement generalization and that several theories of the neural control of movement, based on perturbations applied by robots or in virtual reality, may need to be extended by incorporating prior influence that is characterized by the familiarity of the perturbation. ©2013 the American Physiological Society.","Familiarity; Generalization function; Motor generalization; Reaching movements; State-space model","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; hand function; hand movement; human; learning; male; motor performance; priority journal; sensorimotor function; task performance; virtual reality; weight change; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Biomechanics; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Hand; Humans; Male; Movement; Psychomotor Performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871868651

The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST-PT ©) is being developed as a computerized version of the peg transfer task of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system using virtual reality technology. We assessed the learning curve of trainees on the VBLaST-PT© using the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method and compared them with those on the FLS to establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PT©. Methods: Eighteen medical students from were assigned randomly to one of three groups: control, VBLaST-training, and FLS-training. The VBLaST and the FLS groups performed a total of 150 trials of the peg-transfer task over a 3-week period, 5 days a week. Their CUSUM scores were computed based on predefined performance criteria (junior, intermediate, and senior levels). Results: Of the six subjects in the VBLaST-training group, five achieved at least the ""junior"" level, three achieved the ""intermediate"" level, and one achieved the ""senior"" level of performance criterion by the end of the 150 trials. In comparison, for the FLS group, three students achieved the ""senior"" criterion and all six students achieved the ""intermediate"" and ""junior"" criteria by the 150th trials. Both the VBLaST-PT© and the FLS systems showed significant skill improvement and retention, albeit with system specificity as measured by transfer of learning in the retention test: The VBLaST-trained group performed better on the VBLaST-PT© than on FLS (p = 0.003), whereas the FLS-trained group performed better on the FLS than on VBLaST-PT© (p = 0.002). Conclusions: We characterized the learning curve for a virtual peg transfer task on the VBLaST-PT© and compared it with the FLS using CUSUM analysis.

Background: For complex perceptual-motor tasks that involve several components and require spatial awareness of the environment, part-task training will be effective if the benefit of being able to focus attention on each component outweighs the cost of integrating the components. We predicted that such would be the case for learning to operate an excavator. Method: A part-task training group practiced separate Carrier Positioning, Trenching, and Truck Loading modules, whereas a whole-task training group practiced the Trench and Load module, which combines elements from the other modules. The latter module, involving different scenarios, was performed by both groups immediately after training and following a 2-week retention interval. Results: Production rate on the trench-and-load task was better overall on the retention test than on the immediate test. The part-task group showed improvement on the retention test compared with the immediate test, whereas the whole-task group did not. The part-task group showed higher productivity rates than did the whole-task group on the retention test. Conclusion: Part-task training on the excavator simulator results in better skill retention than does whole-task training. The benefit of part-task training is likely to be found for other tasks requiring control of implements in various environments. Application: Part-task training can result in better retention of complex perceptual-motor skills involving several components, even when immediate transfer to the whole task does not show better performance than whole-task training.

A particularly simple task in this trainer box is the peg transfer task which is aimed at testing the surgeon's bimanual dexterity, hand-eye coordination, speed, and precision. The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST©) is a virtual version of the FLS tasks which allows automatic scoring and real-time, subjective quantification of performance without the need of a human proctor. In this article we report validation studies of the VBLaST© peg transfer (VBLaST-PT©) simulator. Methods: Thirty-five subjects with medical background were divided into two groups: experts (PGY 4-5, fellows, and practicing surgeons) and novices (PGY 1-3). The subjects were asked to perform the peg transfer task on both the FLS trainer box and the VBLaST-PT© simulator; their performance was evaluated based on established metrics of error and time. A new length of trajectory (LOT) metric has also been introduced for offline analysis. A questionnaire was used to rate the realism of the virtual system on a 5-point Likert scale. Results: Preliminary face validation of the VBLaST-PT© with 34 subjects rated on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire revealed high scores for all aspects of simulation, with 3.53 being the lowest mean score across all questions. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test performed on the total scores showed significant (p = 0.001) difference between the groups. A similar test performed on the task time (p = 0.002) and the LOT (p = 0.004) separately showed statistically significant differences between the experts and the novices (p < 0.05). The experts appear to be traversing shorter overall trajectories in less time than the novices. Conclusion: VBLaST-PT© showed both face and construct validity and has promise as a substitute for the FLS for training peg transfer skills. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Construct; Face validity; Laparoscopy; Length of trajectory; Surgical training; Virtual reality","accuracy; article; computer program; construct validity; eye hand coordination; face validity; handedness; human; laparoscopic surgery; medical expert; operation duration; postgraduate education; priority journal; professional competence; quantitative analysis; rank sum test; scoring system; simulator; surgeon; surgical error; task performance; velocity; virtual peg transfer simulator; virtual reality; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Computer Systems; Educational Measurement; Educational Technology; Feedback, Sensory; Humans; Laparoscopy; Models, Theoretical; Practice (Psychology); Psychomotor Performance; Questionnaires; Software; Touch; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876298731

Particularly, we examine if detection probabilities are similar for amplitude and frequency modulation for a modulated simulation signal among five time-frequency approaches, and if time-varying changes in system gain are detected using four approaches for estimating time-varying transfer functions. Detection of amplitude and frequency modulation varied among methods and was dependent upon background noise added to the simulated data. Three non-parametric time-frequency methods accurately detected modulation at low frequencies across noise levels but not high frequencies; while the converse was true for a fourth, and a fifth non-parametric approach was not capable of modulation detection. When applied to estimation of time-varying transfer functions, the parametric approach provided the most accurate estimations of system gain changes, detecting a 1 dB step increase. Application of the appropriate methods to laser Doppler recordings of cortical blood flow and arterial pressure data in anesthetized rats reaffirm the presence of time-varying dynamics in renal autoregulation. An increase in the peak system gain and detection of amplitude modulation of the Myogenic mechanism both occurred after inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, suggesting a connection between the operation of underlying regulators and system performance. © 2012 Biomedical Engineering Society.","Amplitude modulation; Frequency modulation; Myogenic response; Time-frequency analysis; Time-varying; Transfer functions; Tubuloglomerular feedback","Accurate estimation; Amplitude and frequency modulations; Arterial pressures; Background noise; Cortical blood flows; Detection probabilities; High frequency; Laser doppler; Modulation detection; Myogenic mechanisms; Myogenic response; Nitric-oxide synthase; Noise levels; Non-parametric; Nonparametric approaches; Parametric approach; Renal autoregulation; Simulation signals; System gain; Temporal property; Time frequency analysis; Time varying; Time-frequency approach; Time-frequency methods; Time-varying changes; Time-varying dynamics; Time-varying transfer functions; Amplitude modulation; Frequency modulation; Nitric oxide; Transfer functions; Estimation; animal; article; biological model; blood flow; blood pressure; Fourier analysis; homeostasis; kidney; physiology; rat; spontaneously hypertensive rat; Sprague Dawley rat; vascularization; Animals; Blood Pressure; Fourier Analysis; Homeostasis; Kidney; Models, Biological; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Regional Blood Flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871640152

However, the amount of data in-volved in a wide-area VM migration is substantially larger compared to VM migrations within LAN due to the need to transfer virtualized storage in addition to memory and CPU states. This increase of data makes it chal-lenging to relocate VMs under a limited time window with electrical power. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to improve live storage migration across WAN. The key idea is to reduce the amount of data to be trans-ferred by proactively caching virtual disk blocks to a backup site during regular VM operation. As a result of pre-cached disk blocks, the proposed mechanism can dramatically reduce the amount of data and consequently the time required to live migrate the entire VM state. The mechanism was evaluated using a prototype implementation under different workloads and network conditions, and we confirmed that it dramatically reduces the time to complete a VM live migration. By using the proposed mechanism, it is possible to relocate a VM from Japan to the United States in just under 40 seconds. This relocation would otherwise take over 1500 seconds, demon-strating that the proposed mechanism was able to reduce the migration time by 97.5%. © 2013 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Disaster recovery; Live migration; Virtual ma-chine monitor; Virtual machine","Computer simulation; Virtual storage; Disaster recovery; Electrical power; Live migrations; Migration mechanisms; Migration time; Network condition; Prototype implementations; Virtual machines; Disasters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889054144

We examined whether and how this adaptation normalizes to differences in blur between the two eyes, which can routinely arise from differences in refractive errors. Observers adapted to images filtered to simulate optical defocus or different axes of astigmatism, as well as to images that were isotropically blurred or sharpened by varying the slope of the amplitude spectrum. Adaptation to the different types of blur produced strong aftereffects that showed strong transfer across the eyes, as assessed both in a monocular adaptation task and in a contingent adaptation task in which the two eyes were simultaneously exposed to different blur levels. Selectivity for the adapting eye was thus generally weak. When one eye was exposed to a sharper image than the other, the aftereffects also tended to be dominated by the sharper image. Our results suggest that while shortterm adaptation can rapidly recalibrate the perception of blur, it cannot do so independently for the two eyes, and that the binocular adaptation of blur is biased by the sharper of the two eyes' retinal images. © 2013 ARVO.",,"adaptation; article; blur; contrast sensitivity; depth perception; human; interocular transfer; methodology; monocular vision; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; refraction error; vision; visual adaptation; adaptation; blur; interocular transfer; Adaptation, Ocular; Contrast Sensitivity; Depth Perception; Humans; Photic Stimulation; Refractive Errors; Vision Disparity; Vision, Monocular; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884747531

However, these programming models are characterized by a challenging learning curve for non-experts due to their complex and low-level APIs. Looking to the future, improving the accessibility of GPUs and accelerators for mainstream software developers is crucial to bringing the benefits of these heterogeneous architectures to a broader set of application domains. A key challenge in doing so is that mainstream developers are accustomed to working with high-level managed languages, such as Java, rather than lower-level native languages such as C, CUDA, and OpenCL. The OpenCL standard enables portable execution of SIMD kernels across a wide range of platforms, including multi-core CPUs, many-core GPUs, and FPGAs. However, using OpenCL from Java to program multi-architecture systems is difficult and error-prone. Programmers are required to explicitly perform a number of lowlevel operations, such as (1) managing data transfers between the host system and the GPU, (2) writing kernels in the OpenCL kernel language, (3) compiling kernels & performing other OpenCL initialization, and (4) using the Java Native Interface (JNI) to access the C/C++ APIs for OpenCL. In this paper, we present compile-time and run-time techniques for accelerating programs written in Java using automatic generation of OpenCL as a foundation. Our approach includes (1) automatic generation of OpenCL kernels and JNI glue code from a parallel-for construct (forall) available in the Habanero-Java (HJ) language, (2) leveraging HJ's array view language construct to efficiently support rectangular, multi-dimensional arrays on OpenCL devices, and (3) implementing HJ's phaser (next) construct for all-to-all barrier synchronization in automatically generated OpenCL kernels. Our approach is named HJ-OpenCL. Contrasting with past approaches to generating CUDA or OpenCL from high-level languages, the HJ-OpenCL approach helps the programmer preserve Java exception semantics by generating both exception-safe and unsafe code regions. The execution of one or the other is selected at runtime based on the safe language construct introduced in this paper. We use a set of ten Java benchmarks to evaluate our approach, and observe performance improvements due to both native OpenCL execution and parallelism. On an AMD APU, our results show speedups of up to 36.7× relative to sequential Java when executing on the host 4-core CPU, and of up to 55.0× on the integrated GPU. For a system with an Intel Xeon CPU and a discrete NVIDIA Fermi GPU, the speedups relative to sequential Java are 35.7× for the 12-core CPU and 324.0× for the GPU. Further, we find that different applications perform optimally in JVM execution, in OpenCL CPU execution, and in OpenCL GPU execution. The language features, compiler extensions, and runtime extensions included in this work enable portability, rapid prototyping, and transparent execution of JVM applications across all OpenCL platforms.

Outside of surgical education, frame-of-reference (FOR) training has been shown to be an effective training modality to teach raters the specific performance indicators associated with each point on a rating scale. Little is known, however, about what form and duration of FOR training is needed to accomplish reliable ratings among surgical faculty. DESIGN: Two groups of surgical faculty separately underwent either an accelerated 1-hour (n = 10) or immersive four-hour (n = 34) FOR faculty development program. Both programs included a formal presentation and a facilitated discussion of sample behaviors for each point on the Zwisch operating room performance rating scale (see DaRosa et al.8). The immersive group additionally participated in a small group exercise that included additional practice. After training, both groups were tested using 10 video clips of trainees at various levels. Responses were scored against expert consensus ratings. The 2-sided Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare between group means. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All trainees were faculty members in the Department of Surgery of a large midwestern private medical school. RESULTS: Faculty undergoing the 1-hour FOR training program did not have a statistically different mean correct response rate on the video test when compared with those undergoing the 4-hour training program (88% vs 80%; p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: One-hour FOR training sessions are likely sufficient to train surgical faculty to reliably use a simple evaluation instrument for the assessment of intra-operative performance. Additional research is needed to determine how these results generalize to different assessment instruments. (J Surg 70:703-708. © 2013 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

It has been suggested that the effect of spatial smoothing on decoding performance is minor because smoothing operation is an invertible data transformation and such invertible transformation does not remove information in multivariate pattern. Our theoretical consideration, however, revealed that generalization score (performance for test samples unused during classifier training) was susceptible to non-uniform scaling of input data; SVM classifier became less sensitive to variability in shrunk dimension. This result indicates that spatial smoothing reduces sensitivity of SVM classifier to high spatial frequency pattern so that the effect of smoothing implies the amount of information distributed in spatial frequencies. We also examined the effect of smoothing in an fMRI experiment of decoding ocular dominance responses. The results of group statistic showed that large smoothing reduced decoding accuracies while the smoothing effect at individual subject were not the same for all subjects. These results suggest that spatial smoothing can have major effect on decoding performance and the informative pattern for columnar level decoding resides in higher frequencies on average across subjects while it may distribute multiple frequencies at individual subject level. © 2012.","Columnar-level decoding; Informative spatial frequency; Multivoxel pattern analysis; Support vector machine","accuracy; adult; article; clinical article; data processing; eye dominance; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; kernel method; male; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; support vector machine; visual cortex; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Support Vector Machines; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871017588

We conducted five focus groups with privately insured, healthy, middle-aged Americans (n = 43) to explore these apparent preferences. Contrary to previous research, an unexpected distinction emerged. Participants placed enormous value on testing and screening, reacting with hostility to guidelines recommending less of either. However, they were suspicious of overmedication. The wariness of pharmaceuticals and enthusiasm for testing and screening both appear to reflect participants' efforts to take responsibility for their health. But recommendations to test and screen less conflicted with their active, engaged, information-seeking roles. Nonetheless, given patients' concerns about overuse of pharmaceuticals, we maintain that they can learn to understand the connections between over-testing and over-treatment, and can actively choose to do less. We close with suggestions about how treatment guidelines can better communicate these connections to patients. Our findings cannot necessarily be generalized beyond privately-insured, healthy, middle-aged Americans. But because we found that, among these individuals, attitudes towards pharmaceuticals differ from attitudes towards testing and screening, we maintain that future research should also distinguish among and compare attitudes towards different types of medical interventions. © 2012 Schleifer, Rothman.",,"adult; article; clinical article; clinical research; cooperation; diagnostic test; drug therapy; female; health insurance; human; male; medical information; medical intervention; medical procedures; overmedication; patient attitude; patient decision making; practice guideline; responsibility; screening test; treatment outcome; United States; Attitude to Health; Decision Making; Focus Groups; Health Services; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Patient Preference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871557185

The system considered is a simple cantilever beam with an attached cubic nonlinear spring at its tip. Nonlinear system identification (NSI) method applied in this work uses numerical simulation results and combines slow-flow dynamic analysis and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to reconstruct the dynamics in modal coordinates as reducedorder models. The reduced-order models are single-degree-of freedom linear oscillators, which are termed intrinsic modal oscillators (IMOs), with a forcing computed through slow-flow analysis. These forced oscillators are capable of reproducing the modal dynamics, and their forcing amplitudes provide essential information about modal interactions and energy transfer. The proposed NSI method was applied to 3 main cases, corresponding to weakly nonlinear, strongly nonlinear and linear dynamics, respectively. A discrete model of the original system is used to investigate the internal resonances and nonlinearity effects in the original system, by making use of Frequency-Energy plots (FEPs).

The WRF software infrastructure consists of several components such as dynamic solvers and physical simulation modules. WRF includes several Land-Surface Models (LSMs). The LSMs use atmospheric information, the radiative and precipitation forcing from the surface layer scheme, the radiation scheme, and the microphysics/convective scheme all together with the lands state variables and land-surface properties, to provide heat and moisture fluxes over land and sea-ice points. The WRF 5-layer thermal diffusion simulation is an LSM based on the MM5 5-layer soil temperature model with an energy budget that includes radiation, sensible, and latent heat flux. The WRF LSMs are very suitable for massively parallel computation as there are no interactions among horizontal grid points. More and more scientific applications have adopted graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the computing performance. This study demonstrates our GPU massively parallel computation efforts on the WRF 5-layer thermal diffusion scheme. Since this scheme is only an intermediate module of the entire WRF model, the I/O transfer does not involve in the intermediate process. Without data transfer, this module can achieve a speedup of 36x with one GPU and 108x with four GPUs as compared to a single threaded CPU processor. With CPU/GPU hybrid strategy, this module can accomplish a even higher speedup, ∼114x with one GPU and ∼240x with four GPUs. Meanwhile, we are seeking other approaches to improve the speeds. © 2012 SPIE.","5-layer thermal diffusion; Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA); Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)","Compute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA); Graphics Processing Unit; Graphics processing units; Numerical weather prediction; Parallel implementations; Scientific applications; Soil temperature models; Weather research and forecasting; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Computer simulation; Data transfer; Parallel architectures; Program processors; Remote sensing; Research; Surface properties; Thermal diffusion; Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875716344

It is thus important to establish effective training methods across these machine types and to determine the extent to which skills operating one machine transfer to another. An issue of concern is whether learning to operate a single piece of equipment is best if all practice is on that equipment, or whether intermixed training on a related piece of equipment can be of value (or possibly a hindrance). In the present study, naïve participants prac-ticed performing a controls familiarization task on a simulated hydraulic excavator in an initial session. In a second session, one-third of the participants were trained on a simulated loader, another third continued practicing on the simulated excavator, and the final third engaged in an unrelated reading task. For a final session, all participants again performed the controls familiari-zation task on the excavator. Execution time, number of control errors, and ratings of mental workload decreased with practice. The intervening reading task led to more control errors in the third session, but training on the loader had no effect on any performance measure. Learning to operate a loader apparently does not interfere with learning to operate an excavator. Copyright 2012 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc.

The approach is based on the scheme developed by Flicker in 2003 [1], and consists in post-processing the measurement covariance matrix of multiple low-order natural guide star wavefront sensors controlling tip/tilt and tilt anisoplanatism. An innovative simulation model based ""balanced"" algorithm is introduced to capture error terms not accounted for in Flicker's algorithm.

During the process, however, different factors may cause shrinkage errors on the final lens shape and index drop which affect the optical performance of the final molded lens. Currently, such errors have to be compensated by time-consuming and cost intensive iteration loops featuring tryout molding and mold revising. In order to avoid this iteration process in precision glass molding, an integrated numerical simulation tool developed at Fraunhofer IPT is introduced in this paper based on several case studies, which can be used to provide optimized mold design, process design and automated mold compensation of the mold insert. In this process simulation, the entire molding process, including the heating, molding and cooling steps, are precisely described by a combined thermal and structural model. Generalized Maxwell Model is used to describe the complex stress and structural relaxation behavior of the glass, and detailed test series are conducted to acquire precise knowledge about the material properties of optical glass. In this way, the deformation of glass pre-forms during the molding phase and thermal shrinkage of the molded glass optics during the cooling phase can be precisely predicted in the process simulation. Based on this information, a compensated contour layout for mold inserts, as well as an optimized process parameter set can be defined in advance and directly applied to the initial mold inserts during manufacturing, so that the challenging practical integration is eliminated. Further more, a 3D process simulation has also been successfully developed for the prediction of pitch error of molded glass wafer optics. With the motivation to adapt this simulation approach to the requirements of industrial applications, a Graphical User Interface was also developed. With this GUI, The customer will be able to use this interface to perform simulations of his own without technical knowledge of the finite element method (FEM). The positive feedback from customer shows that the developed flexible and reliable numerical simulation is a useful tool to reduce the development cost and enhance the performance of precision glass molding for industrial application. © 2012 SPIE.","Compensation; FEM; Form deviation; Glass optics; Numerical simulation; Precision glass molding; Relaxation; Visco-elastic","Form deviation; Glass optics; Precision glass moldings; Relaxation; Visco-elastic; Compensation (personnel); Computer simulation; Die casting inserts; Errors; Finite element method; Graphical user interfaces; Industrial applications; Lenses; Manufacture; Model structures; Molding; Molds; Optical glass; Optics; Optimization; Process design; Shrinkage; Testing; Glass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875481437

Typically, spectral variants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (FPs) are incorporated into proteins expressed in cells, and FRET between donor and acceptor FPs is assayed. As appreciable FRET occurs only when donors and acceptors are within 10 nm of each other, the presence of FRET can be indicative of aggregation that may denote association of interacting species. By monitoring the excited-state (fluorescence) decay of the donor in the presence and absence of acceptors, dual-component decay analysis has been used to reveal the fraction of donors that are FRET positive (i.e., in aggregates)._However, control experiments using constructs containing both a donor and an acceptor FP on the same protein repeatedly indicate that a large fraction of these donors are FRET negative, thus rendering the interpretation of dual-component analysis for aggregates between separately donor-containing and acceptor-containing proteins problematic. Using Monte-Carlo simulations and analytical expressions, two possible sources for such anomalous behavior are explored: 1) conformational heterogeneity of the proteins, such that variations in the distance separating donor and acceptor FPs and/or their relative orientations persist on time-scales long in comparison with the excited-state lifetime, and 2) FP dark states.",,"green fluorescent protein; article; binding site; controlled study; donor; energy transfer; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; kernel method; Monte Carlo method; probability; protein aggregation; protein expression; protein polymorphism; protein transport; Computer Simulation; Darkness; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Monte Carlo Method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869021496

While a large part of its potential lies in the ability to integrate it with laboratory research, modeling currently generally requires a high degree of training in mathematics and/or computer science. To help address this issue, we have developed a web-based tool, Bio-Logic Builder, that enables laboratory scientists to define mathematical representations (based on a discrete formalism) of biological regulatory mechanisms in a modular and non-technical fashion. As part of the user interface, generalized ""bio-logic"" modules have been defined to provide users with the building blocks for many biological processes. To build/modify computational models, experimentalists provide purely qualitative information about a particular regulatory mechanisms as is generally found in the laboratory. The Bio-Logic Builder subsequently converts the provided information into a mathematical representation described with Boolean expressions/rules. We used this tool to build a number of dynamical models, including a 130-protein large-scale model of signal transduction with over 800 interactions, influenza A replication cycle with 127 species and 200+ interactions, and mammalian and budding yeast cell cycles.

However, few studies have examined the effect of implicit magnitude on time estimates. The current study used a duration estimation task to investigate the effects of implicit magnitude on time estimation in three experiments. During the duration estimation task, the target words named objects of various lengths (Experiment 1), weights (Experiment 2) and volumes (Experiment 3) were presented on the screen and participants were asked to reproduce the amount of time the words remained on the screen via button presses. Results indicated that the time estimates were modulated by the implicit magnitude of the word's referent with words named objects of smaller magnitude (shorter, lighter, or smaller) being judged to last a shorter time, and words named objects of greater magnitude (longer, heavier, or bigger) being judged to last a longer time. These findings were consistent with previous studies examining the effect of implicit spatial length on time estimates. More importantly, current results extended the implicit magnitude of length to the implicit magnitude of weight and volume and demonstrated a functional interaction between time and implicit magnitude in all three aspects of quantity, suggesting a common generalized magnitude system. These results provided new evidence to support a theory of magnitude (ATOM). © 2012 Ma et al.",,"adult; article; association; decision making; depth perception; female; human; human experiment; image display; information processing; male; normal human; response time; task performance; time perception; volunteer; Cognition; Humans; Language",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867508691

Toward this goal, we report an experimental study involving nine experts, where each one was given more than 8,000 digital microscopic images of individual human red blood cells and asked to identify malaria infected cells. The results of this experiment reveal that even highly trained medical experts are not always self-consistent in their diagnostic decisions and that there exists a fair level of disagreement among experts, even for binary decisions (i.e., infected vs. uninfected). To tackle this general medical diagnosis problem, we propose a probabilistic algorithm to fuse the decisions made by trained medical experts to robustly achieve higher levels of accuracy when compared to individual experts making such decisions. By modelling the decisions of experts as a three component mixture model and solving for the underlying parameters using the Expectation Maximisation algorithm, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach which significantly improves the overall diagnostic accuracy of malaria infected cells. Additionally, we present a mathematical framework for performing 'slide-level' diagnosis by using individual 'cell-level' diagnosis data, shedding more light on the statistical rules that should govern the routine practice in examination of e.g., thin blood smear samples.

The secondary objective was to evaluate whether the instrument's scores demonstrate evidence of validity. METHODS: Two aspects of reliability were examined, interrater reliability and internal consistency. To assess interrater reliability, intraclass correlations were calculated for 114 simulation instructors enrolled in webinar training courses in the use of the DASH. The instructors reviewed a series of 3 standardized debriefing sessions. To assess internal consistency, Cronbach α was calculated for this cohort. Finally, 1 measure of validity was examined by comparing the scores across 3 debriefings of different quality. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for the individual elements were predominantly greater than 0.6. The overall intraclass correlation coefficient for the combined elements was 0.74. Cronbach α was 0.89 across the webinar raters. There were statistically significant differences among the ratings for the 3 standardized debriefings (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The DASH scores showed evidence of good reliability and preliminary evidence of validity. Additional work will be needed to assess the generalizability of the DASH based on the psychometrics of DASH data from other settings.

This shapes the output of signal responses as well as providing specificity and localization. The Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinases (MAGuKs) are scaffold proteins at cellular junctions that localize cell surface receptors and link them to downstream signaling enzymes. Scaffold proteins often contain protein-binding domains that are connected in series by disordered linkers. The tertiary structure of the folded domains is well understood, but describing the dynamic inter-domain interactions (the superteritary structure) of such multidomain proteins remains a challenge to structural biology. We used 65 distance restraints from singlemolecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to describe the superteritary structure of the canonical MAGuK scaffold protein PSD-95. By combining multiple fluorescence techniques, the conformational dynamics of PSD-95 could be characterized across the biologically relevant timescales for protein domain motions. Relying only on a qualitative interpretation of FRET data, we were able to distinguish stable interdomain interactions from freely orienting domains. This revealed that the five domains in PSD-95 partitioned into two independent supramodules: PDZ1-PDZ2 and PDZ3-SH3-GuK. We used our smFRET data for hybrid structural refinement to model the PDZ3-SH3-GuK supramodule and include explicit dye simulations to provide complete characterization of potential uncertainties inherent to quantitative interpretation of FRET as distance. Comparative structural analysis of synaptic MAGuK homologues showed a conservation of this supertertiary structure. Our approach represents a general solution to describing the supertertiary structure of multidomain proteins.","Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; Fluorescence lifetime; Intrinsic disorder; Protein structure; Single molecule fluorescence","dye; postsynaptic density protein 95; article; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; genetic conservation; PDZ domain; priority journal; protein analysis; protein conformation; protein domain; protein interaction; protein localization; protein supertertiary structure; protein tertiary structure; structure analysis; Animals; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Structure, Tertiary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866875419

A ubiquitous circuit feature that can give rise to such correlations consists of overlapping, or common, inputs to pairs and populations of cells, leading to common spike train responses. Here, we use computational tools to study how the transfer of common input currents into common spike outputs is modulated by the physiology of the recipient cells. We focus on a key conductance, gA, for the A-type potassium current, which drives neurons between ""type II"" excitability (low gA), and ""type I"" excitability (high gA). Regardless of gA, cells transform common input fluctuations into a tendency to spike nearly si multaneously.However, this process is more pronounced at low gA values. Thus, for a given level of common input, type II neurons produce spikes that are relatively more correlated over short time scales. Over long time scales, the trend reverses, with type II neurons producing relatively less correlated spike trains. This is because these cells' increased tendency for simultaneous spiking is balanced by an anticorrelation of spikes at larger time lags. These findings extend and interpret prior findings for phase oscillators to conductance-based neuron models that cover both oscillatory (superthreshold) and subthreshold firing regimes. We demonstrate a novel implication for neural signal processing: downstream cells with long time constants are selectively driven by type I cell populations upstream and those with short time constants by type II cell populations. Our results are established via high-throughput numerical simulations and explained via the cells' filtering properties and nonlinear dynamics. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","Connor-Stevens model; Linear response; Spike time correlations; Spike-triggered average; Synchrony","article; biological model; cell population; correlation analysis; nerve cell; nerve cell membrane conductance; nerve cell stimulation; oscillator; potassium current; priority journal; signal processing; signal transduction; spike wave; Action Potentials; Animals; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Potassium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866414177

Ideally, these studies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to improved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To accomplish this, models must accurately describe spiking activity while avoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of populations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms that influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop a point process model of individual auditory nerve fibers that provides a compact and accurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by the framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a cascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be associated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal dynamics. Moreover, we derive a semianalytical procedure that uniquely determines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics from recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including threshold, relative spread, jitter, and chronaxie. The model also accounts for refractory and summation effects that influence the responses of auditory nerve fibers to high pulse rate stimulation. Throughout, we compare model predictions to published physiological data of response to high and low pulse rate stimulation. We find that the model, although constructed to fit data from single and paired pulse experiments, can accurately predict responses to unmodulated and modulated pulse train stimuli. We close by performing an ideal observer analysis of simulated spike trains in response to sinusoidally amplitude modulated stimuli and find that carrier pulse rate does not affect modulation detection thresholds. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","Cochlear implant; Computer simulation; Modulation detection; Neural prosthetic","acoustic nerve fiber; article; auditory nerve electrical stimulation; biophysics; chronaxy; conceptual framework; electrostimulation; nerve stimulation; point process framework; priority journal; pulse rate; Action Potentials; Afferent Pathways; Animals; Biophysics; Cochlear Nerve; Electric Stimulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Refractory Period, Electrophysiological; Sensory Thresholds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865809777

These occur in populations that do not have high rates of partner acquisition, and research suggests that a pattern of fewer, but concurrent, partnerships may be the mechanism that provides the connectivity necessary for sustained transmission. We examine how network size affects the impact of concurrency on network connectivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We use a stochastic network model to generate a sample of networks, varying the size of the network and the level of concurrency, and compare the largest components for each scenario to the asymptotic expected values. While the threshold for the growth of a giant component does not change, the transition is more gradual in the smaller networks. As a result, low levels of concurrency generate more connectivity in small networks. Conclusions/Significance: Generalized HIV epidemics are by definition those that spread to a larger fraction of the population, but the mechanism may rely in part on the dynamics of transmission in a set of linked small networks. Examples include rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa and segregated minority populations in the US, where the effective size of the sexual network may well be in the hundreds, rather than thousands. Connectivity emerges at lower levels of concurrency in smaller networks, but these networks can still be disconnected with small changes in behavior. Concurrency remains a strategic target for HIV combination prevention programs in this context. © 2012 Carnegie, Morris.",,"adult; article; effect size; epidemic; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; population density; population dynamics; population research; population size; sexuality; simulation; stochastic model; Africa South of the Sahara; HIV Infections; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865280279

Previous computer simulation studies have shown that five modules satisfy the sagittal-plane biomechanical sub-tasks of 2D walking. The present study shows that a sixth module, which contributes primarily to mediolateral balance control and contralateral leg swing, is needed to satisfy the additional non-sagittal plane demands of 3D walking. Body support was provided by Module 1 (hip and knee extensors, hip abductors) in early stance and Module 2 (plantarflexors) in late stance. In early stance, forward propulsion was provided by Module 4 (hamstrings), but net braking occurred due to Modules 1 and 2. Forward propulsion was provided by Module 2 in late stance. Module 1 accelerated the body medially throughout stance, dominating the lateral acceleration in early stance provided by Modules 4 and 6 (adductor magnus) and in late stance by Module 2, except near toe-off. Modules 3 (ankle dorsiflexors, rectus femoris) and 5 (hip flexors and adductors except adductor magnus) accelerated the ipsilateral leg forward in early swing whereas Module 4 decelerated the ipsilateral leg prior to heel-strike. Finally, Modules 1, 4 and 6 accelerated the contralateral leg forward prior to and during contralateral swing. Since the modules were based on experimentally measured muscle activity, these results provide further evidence that a simple neural control strategy involving muscle activation modules organized around task-specific biomechanical functions may be used to control complex human movements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Forward dynamics simulation; Mediolateral balance control; Muscle synergies; Power transfer","Balance control; Biomechanical functions; Coexcitation; Forward dynamics simulation; Forward propulsion; Human movements; Human walking; Knee extensor; Lateral acceleration; Mediolateral; Modular control; Muscle activation; Muscle activities; Neural control; Power transfers; Rectus femoris; Subtasks; Biomechanics; Three dimensional; Muscle; adult; ankle; article; biomechanics; body equilibrium; computer simulation; extensor muscle; female; flexor muscle; hamstring; heel; hip; human; human experiment; kinematics; knee; leg movement; male; motor control; muscle contraction; muscle function; nonbiological model; normal human; priority journal; rectus femoris muscle; standing; task performance; three dimensional imaging; walking; Computer Simulation; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lower Extremity; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864106166

Typically, such methods are applied only after data collection is complete. However, brief disturbances - perturbations - can occur as a process unfolds and can result in undesirable outcomes if not acted on. The application of dynamics in real time would be useful for detecting these sudden changes. Real-time analysis was accomplished by updating dynamical estimates simultaneously across different window sizes. We calculated the largest Lyapunov exponent, a measure of dynamical stability, to detect a perturbation to team communication in a simulated uninhabited air vehicle (UAV) reconnaissance mission. The perturbation consisted of information demands from a confederate that occurred unexpectedly during performance of a UAV mission. We demonstrate the use of real-time methods in detecting that perturbation as it occurred. In application, this technique would have enabled real-time intervention. Extensions of the real-time dynamical method to other domains of psychological inquiry are discussed.Practitioner Summary: A real-time dynamical analysis method that was developed to detect unexpected perturbations in team communication is described. The use of the method is demonstrated on perturbed communication from a three-person uninhabited air vehicle command-and-control team. The generalisability of the method is considered with respect to physiological and motor coordination dynamics. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","dynamical systems; Lyapunov exponent; perturbation; real-time analysis; team communication","Command-and-control; Data collection; Dynamical analysis; Dynamical stability; Dynamical systems method; Information demand; Largest Lyapunov exponent; Lyapunov exponent; Motor co-ordination; perturbation; Real time; Real time analysis; Reconnaissance mission; Sudden change; Team communication; UAV missions; Uninhabited air vehicles; Window Size; Biomechanics; Communication; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Management; Stability; Lyapunov methods; article; confidence interval; cooperation; group process; human; interpersonal communication; male; regression analysis; task performance; Communication; Confidence Intervals; Cooperative Behavior; Group Processes; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Male; Regression Analysis; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864567794

Two candidate mechanisms of synchronized firing include direct coupling and shared noisy inputs. In neighboring parasol cells of primate retina, which exhibit rapid synchronized firing that has been studied extensively, recent experimental work indicates that direct electrical or synaptic coupling is weak, but shared synaptic input in the absence of modulated stimuli is strong. However, previous modeling efforts have not accounted for this aspect of firing in the parasol cell population. Here we develop a new model that incorporates the effects of common noise, and apply it to analyze the light responses and synchronized firing of a large, densely-sampled network of over 250 simultaneously recorded parasol cells. We use a generalized linear model in which the spike rate in each cell is determined by the linear combination of the spatio-temporally filtered visual input, the temporally filtered prior spikes of that cell, and unobserved sources representing common noise. The model accurately captures the statistical structure of the spike trains and the encoding of the visual stimulus, without the direct coupling assumption present in previous modeling work. Finally, we examined the problem of decoding the visual stimulus from the spike train given the estimated parameters. The common-noise model produces Bayesian decoding performance as accurate as that of a model with direct coupling, but with significantly more robustness to spike timing perturbations. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Generalized linear model; Multielectrode; Random-effects model; Recording; Retina; State-space model","animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell synchronization; controlled study; experimental design; Macaca mulatta; nerve cell network; nonhuman; pigment epithelium; priority journal; retina ganglion cell; retina receptive field; signal processing; spike wave; statistical model; stimulus response; visual stimulation; Action Potentials; Animals; Computer Simulation; Macaca mulatta; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Photic Stimulation; Retina; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Visual Pathways",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863868057

However, before setting these standards of performance, the reliability of the scores yielding from a grading tool must be assessed. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of scores generated from a set of grading checklists used by nonexpert raters during simulations of American Heart Association (AHA) Megacodes. Methods: The reliability of scores generated from a detailed set of checklists,when used by 4 nonexpert raters, was tested by grading team leader performance in 8 Megacode scenarios. Videos of the scenarios were reviewed and rated by trained faculty facilitators and a group of nonexpert raters. The videos were reviewed ""continuously"" and ""with pauses."" The grading made by 2 content experts served as the reference standard, and 4 nonexpert raters were used to test the reliability of the checklists. Results: Our results demonstrate that nonexpert raters are able to produce reliable grades when using the checklists under consideration, demonstrating excellent intrarater reliability and agreement with a reference standard. The results also demonstrate that nonexpert raters can be trained in the proper use of the checklist in a short amount of time, with no discernible learning curve thereafter. Finally, our results show that a single trained rater can achieve reliable scores of team leader performance during AHA Megacodes when using our checklist in a continuous mode because measures of agreement in total scoring were very strong [Lin's (Biometrics 1989;45:255Y268) concordance correlation coefficient, 0.96; intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.97]. Conclusions: We have shown that our checklists can yield reliable scores, are appropriate for use by nonexpert raters, and are able to be used during continuous assessment of team leader performance during the review of a simulated Megacode. This checklist may be more appropriate for use by advanced cardiac life support instructors during Megacode assessments than the current tools provided by the AHA.

We derived the learning curve of young thyroidectomy surgeons as a baseline to enable the accurate assessment of their individual outcomes and avoid erroneous conclusions that may derive from more traditional approaches. Methods: Operative time and postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy of 2006 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy performed by 19 young surgeons in five academic hospitals were monitored from April 2008 to December 2009. The database was randomly divided into training and testing datasets. The training data served to determine the expected performance curve of surgeons during their career and factors influencing outcome variation using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). To simulate prospective monitoring of individual surgeon outcomes, the testing data were plotted on funnel plots and cumulative sum charts (CUSUM). Performance charting methods were utilized to present outcomes adjusted both for patient case-mix and surgeon experience. Results: Generation of performance curves demonstrated a gradual reduction in operative time from 139 (95% CI, 137 to 141) to 75 (71 to 80) minutes, and from 15.7% (15.1% to 16.3%) to 3.3% (3.0% to 3.6%) regarding the nerve palsy rate. Charts interpretation revealed that a very young surgeon had better outcomes than expected, whereas a more experienced surgeon appeared to be a poor performer given the number of years that he had already spent in practice. Conclusions: Not considering the initial learning curve of surgeons exposes them to biased measurement and to misinterpretation in assessing their individual performance for thyroidectomy. The performance chart represents a valuable tool to monitor the outcome of surgeons with the expectation to provide safe and efficient care to patients. © 2012 Duclos et al.",,"accuracy; adult; article; career; cumulative sum chart; female; human; job performance; learning curve; major clinical study; male; operation duration; performance measurement system; physician attitude; postoperative complication; professional competence; professional practice; prospective study; recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; surgeon; thyroidectomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864487645

In this paper we show that this concept can be easily generalized to build other kinds of closed-loop protocols beyond (or in addition to) electrical stimulation and recording in neurophysiology and behavioral studies for neuroethology. In particular, we illustrate three different examples of goal-driven real-time closed-loop interactions with drug microinjectors, mechanical devices and video event driven stimulation. Modern activity-dependent stimulation protocols can be used to reveal dynamics (otherwise hidden under traditional stimulation techniques), achieve control of natural and pathological states, induce learning, bridge between disparate levels of analysis and for a further automation of experiments.

Only two case studies have directly addressed autobiographical memory in DID. Both provided evidence suggestive of dissociative amnesia. The aim of the current study was to objectively assess transfer of autobiographical information between identities in a larger sample of DID patients. Methods: Using a concealed information task, we assessed recognition of autobiographical details in an amnesic identity. Eleven DID patients, 27 normal controls, and 23 controls simulating DID participated. Controls and simulators were matched to patients on age, education level, and type of autobiographical memory tested. Findings: Although patients subjectively reported amnesia for the autobiographical details included in the task, the results indicated transfer of information between identities. Conclusion: The results call for a revision of the DID definition. The amnesia criterion should be modified to emphasize its subjective nature. © 2012 Huntjens et al.",,"adult; age; amnesia; article; autobiographical memory; brain function; clinical article; concealed information task; controlled study; education; female; human; inter identity autobiographical amnesia; mental performance; mental task; multiple personality; recognition; simulation; task performance; Adult; Amnesia; Female; Humans; Memory, Episodic; Multiple Personality Disorder; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864007978

The latter affords the additional opportunity to understand how brain regions interact in a task-dependent manner. The current implementation of PPI in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) is configured primarily to assess connectivity differences between two task conditions, when in practice fMRI tasks frequently employ more than two conditions. Here we evaluate how a generalized form of context-dependent PPI (gPPI; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi), which is configured to automatically accommodate more than two task conditions in the same PPI model by spanning the entire experimental space, compares to the standard implementation in SPM8. These comparisons are made using both simulations and an empirical dataset. In the simulated dataset, we compare the interaction beta estimates to their expected values and model fit using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). We found that interaction beta estimates in gPPI were robust to different simulated data models, were not different from the expected beta value, and had better model fits than when using standard PPI (sPPI) methods. In the empirical dataset, we compare the model fit of the gPPI approach to sPPI. We found that the gPPI approach improved model fit compared to sPPI. There were several regions that became non-significant with gPPI. These regions all showed significantly better model fits with gPPI. Also, there were several regions where task-dependent connectivity was only detected using gPPI methods, also with improved model fit. Regions that were detected with all methods had more similar model fits. These results suggest that gPPI may have greater sensitivity and specificity than standard implementation in SPM. This notion is tempered slightly as there is no gold standard; however, data simulations with a known outcome support our conclusions about gPPI. In sum, the generalized form of context-dependent PPI approach has increased flexibility of statistical modeling, and potentially improves model fit, specificity to true negative findings, and sensitivity to true positive findings. © 2012.","Brain mapping; Context-dependent connectivity; Effective connectivity; FMRI; Functional connectivity; PPI; Psychophysiological interactions","adult; akaike information criterion; article; brain function; brain mapping; clinical assessment tool; conceptual framework; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; male; mathematical analysis; mental task; normal human; priority journal; psychophysiologocal interaction; psychophysiology; recognition; sensitivity and specificity; sensorimotor integration; statistical parametric mapping; synapse; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Neurological; Psychophysiology; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861333995

To further our understanding of the freezing-induced fluid-matrix interaction, we have developed a biphasic model formulation that simulates the transient heat transfer and volumetric expansion during freezing, its resulting fluid movement in the ET, elastic deformation of the solid matrix, and the corresponding pressure redistribution within. Treated as a biphasic material, the ET consists of a porous solid matrix fully saturated with interstitial fluid. Temperature-dependent material properties were employed, and phase change was included by incorporating the latent heat of phase change into an effective specific heat term. Model-predicted temperature distribution, the location of the moving freezing front, and the ET deformation rates through the time course compare reasonably well with experiments reported previously. Results from our theoretical model show that behind the marching freezing front, the ET undergoes expansion due to phase change of its fluid contents. It compresses the region preceding the freezing front leading to its fluid expulsion and reduced regional fluid volume fractions. The expelled fluid is forced forward and upward into the region further ahead of the compression zone causing a secondary expansion zone, which then compresses the region further downstream with much reduced intensity. Overall, it forms an alternating expansion-compression pattern, which moves with the marching freezing front. The present biphasic model helps us to gain insights into some facets of the freezing process and cryopreservation treatment that could not be gleaned experimentally. Its resulting understanding will ultimately be useful to design and improve cryopreservation protocols for ETs. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","biphasic; cryopreservation; engineered tissue; model simulation; poro-elastic","biphasic; Cryo-preservation; Engineered tissues; Model simulation; poro-elastic; Biological materials preservation; Expansion; Tissue; Freezing; article; biphasic model; compression; cryopreservation; freezing; heat transfer; temperature dependence; theoretical model; tissue engineering; tissue expansion; tissue pressure; tissue water; volumetry; biological model; biomechanics; compressive strength; cryopreservation; elasticity; heat; hydrodynamics; mechanical stress; mechanics; Biomechanics; Compressive Strength; Cryopreservation; Elasticity; Hot Temperature; Hydrodynamics; Mechanical Processes; Models, Biological; Stress, Mechanical; Tissue Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863326951

We tested training speed and screen resolution in a project, sponsored by Defence Research and Development Canada, to develop components for prototype air mission simulators.Method: For this study, 54 participants used a single-screen PC-based flight simulation program to learn to chase and catch an F-18A fighter jet with another F-18A while controlling the chase aircraft with a throttle and side-stick controller. Screen resolution was varied between participants, and training speed was varied factorially across two sessions within participants. Pretest and posttest trials were at high resolution and criterion (900 knots) speed.Results: Posttest performance was best with high screen resolution training and when one ARTT training session was followed by a session of criterion speed training.Conclusion: ARTT followed by criterion training improves performance on a visual-motor coordination task.

This plasticity affects how synapses filter presynaptic spike trains. The filtering properties of short term depression are often studied using a deterministic synapse model that predicts the mean synaptic response to a presynaptic spike train, but ignores variability introduced by the probabilistic nature of vesicle release and stochasticity in synaptic recovery time. We show that this additional variability has important consequences for the synaptic filtering of presynaptic information. In particular, a synapse model with stochastic vesicle dynamics suppresses information encoded at lower frequencies more than information encoded at higher frequencies, while a model that ignores this stochasticity transfers information encoded at any frequency equally well. This distinction between the two models persists even when large numbers of synaptic contacts are considered.

However, understanding how joint level loads relate to cell level deformations, e.g. in the cartilage, is not a straightforward task. In this study, a multi-scale analysis pipeline was implemented to post-process the results of a macro-scale finite element (FE) tibiofemoral joint model to provide joint mechanics based displacement boundary conditions to micro-scale cellular FE models of the cartilage, for the purpose of characterizing chondrocyte deformations in relation to tibiofemoral joint loading. It was possible to identify the load distribution within the knee among its tissue structures and ultimately within the cartilage among its extracellular matrix, pericellular environment and resident chondrocytes. Various cellular deformation metrics (aspect ratio change, volumetric strain, cellular effective strain and maximum shear strain) were calculated. To illustrate further utility of this multi-scale modeling pipeline, two micro-scale cartilage constructs were considered: an idealized single cell at the centroid of a 100×100×100 μm block commonly used in past research studies, and an anatomically based (11 cell model of the same volume) representation of the middle zone of tibiofemoral cartilage. In both cases, chondrocytes experienced amplified deformations compared to those at the macro-scale, predicted by simulating one body weight compressive loading on the tibiofemoral joint. In the 11 cell case, all cells experienced less deformation than the single cell case, and also exhibited a larger variance in deformation compared to other cells residing in the same block. The coupling method proved to be highly scalable due to micro-scale model independence that allowed for exploitation of distributed memory computing architecture. The method's generalized nature also allows for substitution of any macro-scale and/or micro-scale model providing application for other multi-scale continuum mechanics problems. © 2012 Sibole, Erdemir.",,"article; biomechanics; cartilage cell; cell damage; excitation contraction coupling; extracellular matrix; femur; finite element analysis; high throughput screening; knee function; loading test; mathematical model; prediction; process model; shear stress; simulation; stress strain relationship; tibia; weight bearing; articular cartilage; biological model; cartilage cell; computer simulation; cytology; histology; human; knee; ligament; physiology; pressure; Biomechanics; Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Knee; Ligaments, Articular; Models, Biological; Pressure; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861375865

These two measures of generalization have been widely used in psychophysical studies, but the reason that they might differ has not been addressed explicitly. Our goal was to develop a computational framework for determining when a two-state model is justified by the data and to explore the implications of these two types of generalization for neural representations of movements. We first investigated, for single-target learning, how well standard statistical model selection procedures can discriminate two-process models from single-process models when learning and retention coefficients were systematically varied. We then built a two-state model for multitarget learning and showed that if an adaptation process is indeed two-rate, then the postadaptation generalization approach primarily probes the slow process, whereas the trial-by-trial generalization approach is most informative about the fast process. The fast process, due to its strong sensitivity to trial error, contributes predominantly to trial-by-trial generalization, whereas the strong retention of the slow system contributes predominantly to postadaptation generalization. Thus, when adaptation can be shown to be two-rate, the two measures of generalization may probe different brain representations of movement direction. © 2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"adaptation; article; biological model; computer simulation; human; learning; movement (physiology); physiology; Adaptation, Physiological; Computer Simulation; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Learning; Models, Neurological; Movement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861171288

In natural viewing, however, three-dimensional objects are viewed in three-dimensional scenes. Little is known about color constancy for three-dimensional objects. We used a forced-choice task to measure the achromatic chromaticity of matte disks, matte spheres, and glossy spheres. In all cases, the test stimuli were viewed in the context of stereoscopically viewed graphics simulations of three-dimensional scenes, and we varied the scene illuminant. We studied conditions both where all cues were consistent with the simulated illuminant change (consistent-cue conditions) and where local contrast was silenced as a cue (reduced-cue conditions). We computed constancy indices from the achromatic chromaticities. To first order, constancy was similar for the three test object types. There was, however, a reliable interaction between test object type and cue condition. In the consistent-cue conditions, constancy tended to be best for the matte disks, while in the reduced-cue conditions constancy was best for the spheres. The presence of this interaction presents an important challenge for theorists who seek to generalize models that account for constancy for flat tests to the more general case of three-dimensional objects. © ARVO.","Color constancy; Color vision; Shape and color","adolescent; adult; article; association; biological model; color vision; depth perception; female; human; male; methodology; pattern recognition; photostimulation; physiology; surface property; three dimensional imaging; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Color Perception; Color Vision; Cues; Depth Perception; Female; Form Perception; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Models, Neurological; Photic Stimulation; Surface Properties; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861181879

Commensal bacteria of animal intestine may serve as a reservoir of resistance-genes. To understand the dynamics of plasmid-mediated resistance to cephalosporin ceftiofur in enteric commensals of cattle, we developed a deterministic mathematical model of the dynamics of ceftiofur-sensitive and resistant commensal enteric Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the absence of and during parenteral therapy with ceftiofur. The most common treatment scenarios including those using a sustained-release drug formulation were simulated; the model outputs were in agreement with the available experimental data. The model indicated that a low but stable fraction of resistant enteric E. coli could persist in the absence of immediate ceftiofur pressure, being sustained by horizontal and vertical transfers of plasmids carrying resistance-genes, and ingestion of resistant E. coli. During parenteral therapy with ceftiofur, resistant enteric E. coli expanded in absolute number and relative frequency. This expansion was most influenced by parameters of antimicrobial action of ceftiofur against E. coli. After treatment (>5 weeks from start of therapy) the fraction of ceftiofur-resistant cells among enteric E. coli, similar to that in the absence of treatment, was most influenced by the parameters of ecology of enteric E. coli, such as the frequency of transfer of plasmids carrying resistance-genes, the rate of replacement of enteric E. coli by ingested E. coli, and the frequency of ceftiofur resistance in the latter. © 2012 Volkova et al.",,"ceftiofur; antiinfective agent; ceftiofur; cephalosporin derivative; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; antimicrobial activity; article; cattle; commensal Escherichia coli; drug absorption; drug excretion; drug metabolism; horizontal gene transfer; ingestion; mathematical model; nonhuman; plasmid; simulation; sustained drug release; vertical transmission; animal; drug effect; Escherichia coli; intestine; microbiological examination; microbiology; plasmid; Animalia; Bos; Escherichia coli; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cattle; Cephalosporins; Escherichia coli; Intestines; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plasmids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861214053

Parallelizing the process on a Fermi graphic computing engine from NVIDIA increased the speed ~180 times over an application running on an 80 node Linux cluster, considerably reducing simulation times. This application allows users to optimize models for ion channel kinetics on a single, inexpensive, desktop "" super computer,"" greatly reducing the time and cost of building models relevant to neuronal physiology. We also demonstrate that the point of algorithm parallelization is crucial to its performance.

Allen School for Global Animal Health, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, United States","Background: Most of the parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa contain a relict prokaryotic-derived plastid called the apicoplast. This organelle is important not only for the survival of the parasite, but its unique properties make it an ideal drug target. The majority of apicoplast-associated proteins are nuclear encoded and targeted post-translationally to the organellar lumen via a bipartite signaling mechanism that requires an N-terminal signal and transit peptide (TP). Attempts to define a consensus motif that universally identifies apicoplast TPs have failed. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we propose a generalized rule-based classification model to identify apicoplast-targeted proteins (ApicoTPs) that use a bipartite signaling mechanism. Given a training set specific to an organism, this model, called ApicoAP, incorporates a procedure based on a genetic algorithm to tailor a discriminating rule that exploits the known characteristics of ApicoTPs. Performance of ApicoAP is evaluated for four labeled datasets of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium yoelii, Babesia bovis, and Toxoplasma gondii proteins. ApicoAP improves the classification accuracy of the published dataset for P. falciparum to 94%, originally 90% using PlasmoAP. Conclusions/Significance: We present a parametric model for ApicoTPs and a procedure to optimize the model parameters for a given training set. A major asset of this model is that it is customizable to different parasite genomes.

In the olfactory bulb, these behavioral timescales are reflected in the temporal properties of mitral/tufted (M/T) cell spike trains. As the odor information contained in these spike trains is relayed from the bulb to the cortex,interactions between presynaptic spike timingand short-term synaptic plasticity dictate how stimulus features are represented in cortical spike trains. Here, we demonstrate how the timescales associated with respiratory frequency, spike timing, and short-term synaptic plasticity interact to shape cortical responses. Specifically, we quantified the timescales of short-term synaptic facilitation and depression at excitatory synapses between bulbar M/T cells and cortical neurons in slices of mouse olfactory cortex. We then used these results to generate simulated M/T population synaptic currents that were injected into real cortical neurons. M/T population inputs were modulated at frequencies consistent with passive respiration or active sniffing. We show how the differential recruitment of short-term plasticity at breathing versus sniffing frequencies alters cortical spike responses. For inputs at sniffing frequencies, cortical neurons linearly encoded increases in presynaptic firing rates with increased phase-locked, firing rates. In contrast, at passive breathing frequencies, cortical responses saturated with changes in presynaptic rate. Our results suggest that changes in respiratory behavior can gate the transfer of stimulus information between the olfactory bulb and cortex. © 2012 the authors.",,"animal tissue; article; breathing rate; electrophysiology; female; male; mitral cell; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; olfactory bulb; olfactory cortex; olfactory tract; priority journal; pyriform cortex; respiratory rhythm; rhythm; sniffing; spike wave; stimulus; synapse; synaptic potential; synaptic transmission; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biological Clocks; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neuronal Plasticity; Olfactory Pathways; Respiratory Rate; Smell; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860347321

Methods: An ""off-the-shelf"" digital video system was used to capture the hand and instrument movement of surgical trainees (beginner level = PGY-1, intermediate level = PGY-3, and advanced level = PGY-5/fellows) while they performed a peg transfer exercise. The video data were passed through a custom computer vision algorithm that analyzed incoming pixels to measure movement smoothness objectively. Results: The beginner-level group had the poorest performance, whereas those in the advanced group generated the highest scores. Intermediate-level trainees scored significantly (p < 0.04) better than beginner trainees. Advanced-level trainees scored significantly better than intermediate-level trainees and beginner-level trainees (p < 0.04 and p < 0.03, respectively).

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of moveable platform training in improving recovery reactions and reducing fall frequency in older adults. Twenty-four older adults were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups (training and control). Both groups underwent three sessions including baseline slip, training, and transfer of training on a slippery surface. Both groups experienced two slips on a slippery surface, one during the baseline and the other (after 2 weeks) during the transfer of training session. In the training session, the training group underwent twelve simulated slips using a moveable platform while the control group performed normal walking trials. Kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data were collected during all the sessions. Results indicated a reduced incidence of falls in the training group during the transfer of training trial as compared to the control group. The training group was able to transfer proactive and reactive control strategies learned during training to the second slip trial. The proactive adjustments include increased center-of-mass velocity and transitional acceleration after training.

We study the ex post reliability of predictions of the 2010-2011 Haiti cholera outbreak from four independent modeling studies that appeared almost simultaneously during the unfolding epidemic. We consider the impact of different approaches to the modeling of spatial spread of Vibrio cholerae and mechanisms of cholera transmission, accounting for the dynamics of susceptible and infected individuals within different local human communities. To explain resurgences of the epidemic, we go on to include waning immunity and a mechanism explicitly accounting for rainfall as a driver of enhanced disease transmission. The formal comparative analysis is carried out via the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to measure the added information provided by each process modeled, discounting for the added parameters. A generalized model for Haitian epidemic cholera and the related uncertainty is thus proposed and applied to the year-long dataset of reported cases now available. The model allows us to draw predictions on longer-term epidemic cholera in Haiti from multiseason Monte Carlo runs, carried out up to January 2014 by using suitable rainfall fields forecasts. Lessons learned and open issues are discussed and placed in perspective. We conclude that, despite differences in methods that can be tested through model-guided field validation, mathematical modeling of large-scale outbreaks emerges as an essential component of future cholera epidemic control.","Ecohydrology; Epidemiology; Human mobility; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Waterborne diseases","rain; article; cholera; disease transmission; epidemic; Haiti; immunity; mathematical model; Monte Carlo method; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; simulation; Vibrio cholerae; Cholera; Disease Outbreaks; Haiti; Humans; Rain; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860212349

The method, an extension of the generalized linear model (GLM) methodology introduced in Truccolo et al. (2005) to analyze neural spiking data, exploits projection operations motivated by a geometry present in the Fisher information of the GLM maximum likelihood parameter estimator. By exploiting these projections, neural activity can be divided into three categories. These three categories, neural activity due solely to a set of covariates of interest, neural activity due solely to a set of uninteresting, or nuisance, covariates, and neural activity that cannot be unequivocally assigned to either set of covariates, can be associated with physical variables such as time, position, head-direction and velocity. This association allows the analysis of neural activity that can, for example, be due solely to temporal influence, irrespective of other, identified, influences. The method is applied in simulation to a rat exploring a temporally modulated place field. A portion of the analysis reported in MacDonald et al. (2011), using the methodology described herein, is reproduced. This analysis demonstrates the temporal bridging of a delay period in a sequential memory task by firing activity of cells present in the rodent hippocampus that cannot be explained by rodent position, head direction or velocity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Confound; Covariate disambiguation; Generalized linear model; Neural activity disambiguation; Point process; Projection","animal cell; article; data analysis; maximum likelihood method; memory; neural spiking; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; simulation; spike; statistical analysis; statistical model; velocity; Action Potentials; Animals; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Models, Neurological; Models, Theoretical; Neurons; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857206297

Action potential generation in mammalian, versus invertebrate, axons is remarkably energy efficient. Here we demonstrate that this increase in energy efficiency is due largely to a warmer body temperature. Increases in temperature result in an exponential increase in energy efficiency for single action potentials by increasing the rate of Na+ channel inactivation, resulting in a marked reduction in overlap of the inward Na+, and outward K+, currents and a shortening of action potential duration. This increase in single spike efficiency is, however, counterbalanced by a temperature-dependent decrease in the amplitude and duration of the spike afterhyperpolarization, resulting in a nonlinear increase in the spike firing rate, particularly at temperatures above approximately 35°C. Interestingly, the total energy cost, as measured by the multiplication of total Na+ entry per spike and average firing rate in response to a constant input, reaches a global minimum between 37-42°C. Our results indicate that increases in temperature result in an unexpected increase in energy efficiency, especially near normal body temperature, thus allowing the brain to utilize an energy efficient neural code. © 2012 Yu et al.",,"potassium ion; sodium channel; sodium ion; action potential duration; animal cell; animal tissue; article; body temperature; brain temperature; channel gating; controlled study; energy cost; energy efficiency; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; entorhinal cortex; intracellular signaling; mathematical model; mouse; nerve cell membrane potential; nerve cell membrane steady potential; nervous system parameters; nonhuman; potassium current; potassium transport; pyramidal nerve cell; simulation; sodium channel inactivation; sodium current; sodium transport; somatosensory cortex; spike afterhyperpolarization amplitude; spike afterhyperpolarization duration; spike firing rate; temperature dependence; transport kinetics; action potential; animal; biological model; brain; computer simulation; energy transfer; human; nerve cell; physiology; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Action Potentials; Animals; Body Temperature; Brain; Computer Simulation; Energy Transfer; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861125796

However, generalizing these concepts past proof-of-principle to understand the neuromechanical transformation from task-level control to detailed execution-level muscle activity and forces during behaviorally-relevant motor tasks has proved difficult. In an unrestrained balance task in cats, we demonstrate that achieving task-level constraints center of mass forces and moments while minimizing control effort predicts detailed patterns of muscle activity and ground reaction forces in an anatomically-realistic musculoskeletal model. Whereas optimization is typically used to resolve redundancy at a single level of the motor hierarchy, we simultaneously resolved redundancy across both muscles and limbs and directly compared predictions to experimental measures across multiple perturbation directions that elicit different intra- and interlimb coordination patterns. Further, although some candidate task-level variables and cost functions generated indistinguishable predictions in a single biomechanical context, we identified a common optimization framework that could predict up to 48 experimental conditions per animal (n = 3) across both perturbation directions and different biomechanical contexts created by altering animals' postural configuration. Predictions were further improved by imposing experimentally-derived muscle synergy constraints, suggesting additional task variables or costs that may be relevant to the neural control of balance. These results suggested that reduced-dimension neural control mechanisms such as muscle synergies can achieve similar kinetics to the optimal solution, but with increased control effort (≈2×) compared to individual muscle control. Our results are consistent with the idea that hierarchical, task-level neural control mechanisms previously associated with voluntary tasks may also be used in automatic brainstem-mediated pathways for balance. © 2012 McKay, Ting.",,"animal experiment; article; biomechanics; body equilibrium; brain stem response; cat; controlled study; forelimb; hindlimb; kinematics; locomotion; motor control; motor coordination; muscle contraction; muscle force; muscle function; muscle tone; nonhuman; task performance; voluntary movement; animal; biological model; body equilibrium; body posture; computer simulation; innervation; movement (physiology); physiology; skeletal muscle; Animalia; Animals; Cats; Computer Simulation; Models, Neurological; Movement; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Posture; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861128879

Evidence shows that brain rhythms play a role in controlling neuronal excitability and response modulation (Haider B, McCormick D. Neuron 62: 171-189, 2009) and regulate the efficacy of communication between cortical regions (Fries P. Trends Cogn Sci 9: 474-480, 2005) and distinct spatiotemporal scales (Canolty RT, Knight RT. Trends Cogn Sci 14: 506-515, 2010). In this view, anatomically connected brain areas form the scaffolding upon which neuronal oscillations rapidly create and dissolve transient functional networks (Lakatos P, Karmos G, Mehta A, Ulbert I, Schroeder C. Science 320: 110-113, 2008). Importantly, testing these hypotheses requires methods designed to accurately reflect dynamic changes in multivariate phase coupling within brain networks. Unfortunately, phase coupling between neurophysiological signals is commonly investigated using suboptimal techniques. Here we describe how a recently developed probabilistic model, phase coupling estimation (PCE; Cadieu C, Koepsell K Neural Comput 44: 3107-3126, 2010), can be used to investigate changes in multivariate phase coupling, and we detail the advantages of this model over the commonly employed phase-locking value (PLV; Lachaux JP, Rodriguez E, Martinerie J, Varela F. Human Brain Map 8: 194-208, 1999). We show that the N-dimensional PCE is a natural generalization of the inherently bivariate PLV. Using simulations, we show that PCE accurately captures both direct and indirect (network mediated) coupling between network elements in situations where PLV produces erroneous results. We present empirical results on recordings from humans and nonhuman primates and show that the PCEestimated coupling values are different from those using the bivariate PLV. Critically on these empirical recordings, PCE output tends to be sparser than the PLVs, indicating fewer significant interactions and perhaps a more parsimonious description of the data. Finally, the physical interpretation of PCE parameters is straightforward: the PCE parameters correspond to interaction terms in a network of coupled oscillators. Forward modeling of a network of coupled oscillators with parameters estimated by PCE generates synthetic data with statistical characteristics identical to empirical signals. Given these advantages over the PLV, PCE is a useful tool for investigating multivariate phase coupling in distributed brain networks. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.",,"analytical parameters; article; brain function; brain region; dynamic brain network; hypothesis; mathematical model; nervous system parameters; oscillation; phase coupling estimation; phase locking value; priority journal; simulation; validation process; Animals; Brain; Brain Mapping; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859552695

Few studies have examined the impact of the use of video in PBL upon cognitive processes and critical thinking. Those that have done focused on cases involving physical signs, where video has natural advantages. Objectives This study aimed to investigate preferences for video- or text-based cases and the effects of each format upon medical students' deep thinking in PBL. Tutorials were based on material portraying interviews with patients with conditions that include psychosocial elements but no physical signs. Methods Four tutorial groups of students in a Year 2 endocrine and reproductive pathophysiology course participated in a crossover study using one video-based and one text-based case. Transcripts of tutorials were coded for depth of thinking by a blinded coder. A generalised estimating equation model was used to adjust for potential differences among groups, cases, and tutor participation. The distribution of cognitive activity within the crossover groups and the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for deep versus superficial thinking were calculated. A prior cohort of 165 students and 18 tutors completed a survey of learning preferences. Results Of 5224 student utterances, the majority referred to problem exploration (2622, 50%) and description (1479, 28%). Overall, the odds of deep thinking versus superficial thinking were significantly lower using video-based cases compared with text-based cases (2045 deep/2454 for video versus 1961 deep/2218 for text; OR 0.663, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.582-0.754; p<0.0001). This was also true for the problem exploration domain (1217 deep/1365 for video versus 1178 deep/1257 for text; OR 0.559, 95% CI 0.355-0.882; p=0.0125). The majority of students (59%) and tutors (78%) indicated a preference for video-based cases over text-based cases. Conclusions Students and their tutors prefer video-based cases in PBL. However, compared with text-based material, the use of video-based material that refers to cases without dynamic physical signs is associated with a reduction in deep thinking. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2012.",,"article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; crossover procedure; education; female; human; male; medical education; medical student; methodology; problem based learning; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; regression analysis; standard; teaching; thinking; videorecording; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Cross-Over Studies; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Simulation; Problem-Based Learning; Regression Analysis; Students, Medical; Thinking; Video Recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858602874

The distribution and firing rate of these origins, in conjunction with the velocity at which forks progress, dictate the program of the replication process. Previous attempts at modeling DNA replication in eukaryotes have focused on cases where the firing rate and the velocity of replication forks are homogeneous, or uniform, across the genome. However, it is now known that there are large variations in origin activity along the genome and variations in fork velocities can also take place. Here, we generalize previous approaches to modeling replication, to allow for arbitrary spatial variation of initiation rates and fork velocities. We derive rate equations for left- and right-moving forks and for replication probability over time that can be solved numerically to obtain the mean-field replication program. This method accurately reproduces the results of DNA replication simulation. We also successfully adapted our approach to the inverse problem of fitting measurements of DNA replication performed on single DNA molecules. Since such measurements are performed on specified portion of the genome, the examined DNA molecules may be replicated by forks that originate either within the studied molecule or outside of it.

Using a mouse thalamocortical slice preparation, we record the intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic properties of layer 3/4 regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking (FS) interneurons in primary auditory cortex (AI). We find that postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) evoked in FS cells are significantly larger and depress more than those evoked in RS cells after thalamic stimulation. We use these data to construct a simple computational model of the auditory thalamocortical circuit and find that the differences between FS and RS cells observed in vitro generate model behavior similar to that observed in vivo. We examine how feedforward inhibition and synaptic depression affect cortical responses to time-varying inputs that mimic sinusoidal amplitudemodulated tones. In the model, the balance of cortical inhibition and thalamic excitation evolves in a manner that depends on modulation frequency (MF) of the stimulus and determines cortical response tuning. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","Modulation transfer function; Primary auditory cortex; Synaptic depression","animal cell; animal tissue; article; auditory stimulation; computer model; controlled study; in vitro study; interneuron; mouse; nerve excitability; nonhuman; postsynaptic potential; primary auditory cortex; priority journal; pyramidal nerve cell; spike wave; synapse; synaptic transmission; thalamocortical tract; whole cell; Acoustic Stimulation; Action Potentials; Animals; Auditory Cortex; Auditory Pathways; Mice; Neurons; Thalamus; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857354958

Here, we investigated whether prior knowledge influences how infants track transitional probabilities in word segmentation tasks. Are infants biased by prior experience when engaging in sequential statistical learning? In a laboratory simulation of learning across time, we exposed 9- and 10-month-old infants to a list of either disyllabic or trisyllabic nonsense words, followed by a pause-free speech stream composed of a different set of disyllabic or trisyllabic nonsense words. Listening times revealed successful segmentation of words from fluent speech only when words were uniformly disyllabic or trisyllabic throughout both phases of the experiment. Hearing trisyllabic words during the pre-exposure phase derailed infants' abilities to segment speech into disyllabic words, and vice versa.

Key challenges of traditional discrete-event computer simulation software are their inherent complexity for modeling, coding, or analyzing output and their significant costs and training. We propose a simulation platform that runs in spreadsheets. Because of their low cost, popularity and powerful functionality and performance, spreadsheets also allow for the development and management of simulations that efficiently output results that are just as reliable as those from traditional software. Methods: A spreadsheet simulation is developed by modeling one row as one simulated minute (more than 20,000 rows for a 2-week period). Uncertainty in arrivals, patient type, routing, and treatment times is modeled using the ""rand()"" function to simulate the state of the Emergency Department at a given point in time. The patient is tracked with embedded ""if()"" functions and summary statistics are obtained through range functions. We use an equivalence test to determine whether the resulting average length-of-stay figures are the same as those of a traditional simulation platform. Results: We find little significant difference in average length-of-stay figures between both models. Conclusions: Spreadsheet simulations are as effective as traditional simulations but easier to use, understand, and implement. Spreadsheet software is widely available, at a fraction of the cost of discrete-event simulation software. Coding spreadsheet simulations may be more challenging as it requires a different and more novel expertise than traditional computer programming. However, spreadsheets can be organized to reference existing datasets, thus minimizing the burden of copying and likelihood of transcription errors and information leakage. Output analysis can also be customized with user-specific performance statistics and charts.

Understanding this variability is critical for theories of both sensory and motor processing, since response variance affects the accuracy of neural codes. Despite this influence, the cellular and circuit mechanisms that shape the trial-to-trial variability of population responses remain poorly understood. We used a combination of experimental and computational techniques to uncover the mechanisms underlying response variability of populations of pyramidal (E) cells in layer 2/3 of rat whisker barrel cortex. Spike trains recorded from pairs of E-cells during either spontaneous activity or whisker deflected responses show similarly low levels of spiking co-variability, despite large differences in network activation between the two states. We developed network models that show how spike threshold nonlinearities dilutes E-cell spiking co-variability during spontaneous activity and low velocity whisker deflections. In contrast, during high velocity whisker deflections, cancelation mechanisms mediated by feedforward inhibition maintain low E-cell pairwise co-variability. Thus, the combination of these two mechanisms ensure low E-cell population variability over a wide range of whisker deflection velocities. Finally, we show how this active decorrelation of population variability leads to a drastic increase in the population information about whisker velocity. The prevalence of spiking nonlinearities and feedforward inhibition in the nervous system suggests that the mechanisms for low network variability presented in our study may generalize throughout the brain. © 2012 Ly, Middleton and Doiron.","Fisher information; Layer 2/3 somatosensory cortex; Noise correlation; Whisker stimulation","Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Computation theory; Fisher information matrix; Timing circuits; Velocity; Computational technique; Feedforward inhibition; Fisher information; Noise correlation; Population variability; Somatosensory cortex; Trial-to-trial variabilities; Whisker stimulation; Cells; analytic method; animal cell; animal experiment; article; brain cell; calculation; cell population; controlled study; female; leaky integrate and fire model; membrane potential; neocortex; nerve cell stimulation; nonhuman; pyramidal nerve cell; rat; simplified binary neuron model network; simulation; somatosensory cortex; spiking model simulation; stimulus response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087246512

Combining the advantages of realistic training environments and virtual worlds, mixed reality LVC training systems can enable live and virtual trainee interaction as if co-located. However, LVC interaction in these systems often requires constructing immersive environments, developing hardware for live-virtual interaction, tracking in occluded environments, and an architecture that supports real-time transfer of entity information across many systems. This paper discusses a system that overcomes these challenges to empower LVC interaction in a reconfigurable, mixed reality environment. This system was developed and tested in an immersive, reconfigurable, and mixed reality LVC training system for the dismounted warfighter at ISU, known as the Veldt, to overcome LVC interaction challenges and as a test bed for cuttingedge technology to meet future U.S. Army battlefield requirements. Trainees interact physically in the Veldt and virtually through commercial and developed game engines. Evaluation involving military trained personnel found this system to be effective, immersive, and useful for developing the critical decision-making skills necessary for the battlefield. Procedural terrain modeling, model-matching database techniques, and a central communication server process all live and virtual entity data from system components to create a cohesive virtual world across all distributed simulators and game engines in real-time.

Our previous work considered shape and size perception of simple objects via hearing and touch. The focus of this paper is on the perception of a 2-D layout of simple objects with identical size and shape. We consider the selection and rendition of sounds for object identification and localization. We rely on the head-related transfer function for rendering sound directionality, and consider variations of sound intensity and tempo as two alternative approaches for rendering proximity. Subjective experiments with visually-blocked subjects are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53226, United States","Background Circumstances may arise during laparoscopic procedures in which alignment of the laparoscope and the instruments is off by 180°, creating a mirror image of the operative field. It has been shown that task performance is degraded under these reverse-alignment conditions, and that the magnitude of performance impairment is directly related to laparoscopic experience and skill. The aim of this study was to determine if reverse-alignment surgical skills could be developed through training. Methods Twenty-two medical students were randomized to train in either reverse- or forward-alignment conditions on a standardized laparoscopic task in a video trainer (peg transfer). Baseline scores were attained for each group under both orientations. Subjects participated in three 1-h training sessions during an 8-week period. Post-training scores were then obtained under both alignment conditions. Pre and post-training scores were compared for users in each study group under both conditions. Results Post-training assessments in the forward orientation demonstrated that subjects in the forward-training group improved significantly compared to pre-testing, while the performance of subjects in the reverse-training group did not improve. Under reverse-alignment conditions, both groups improved on post-test assessment, with dramatic improvements observed for those in the reversetraining group. Conclusions Laparoscopic novices can learn to adapt to a sensorimotor discordance in a simulated training environment. While it is possible that skills developed by training under standard forward-alignment conditions can be utilized in situations of extreme visual-spatial discordance, the intentional development of reverse-alignment skills by training under these conditions may prove beneficial to novice surgeons. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Education; Laparoscopic skills; Training","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; medical student; personal experience; priority journal; professional competence; scoring system; sensorimotor integration; skill retention; spatial orientation; surgical training; task performance; visual orientation; clinical competence; clinical trial; computer simulation; controlled clinical trial; depth perception; education; laparoscopy; medical education; methodology; orientation; physiology; psychomotor performance; randomized controlled trial; standard; teaching; United States; videorecording; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Laparoscopy; Orientation; Psychomotor Performance; Space Perception; Task Performance and Analysis; Teaching; Video Recording; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857418205

However, many essential activities in cells are spatially and/or temporally dependent on the assembly/disassembly of transient complexes consisting of large-size macromolecules that are frequently separated by distances greater than 100 Å. Expanding the accessible range for FRET to 150 Å would open up many cellular interactions to fluorescence and fluorescence-lifetime imaging. Here, we demonstrate that the use of multiple randomly distributed acceptors on proteins/antibodies, rather than the use of a single localized acceptor, makes it possible to significantly enhance FRET and detect interactions between the donor fluorophore and the acceptor-labeled protein at distances greater than 100 Å. A simple theoretical model for spherical bodies that have been randomly labeled with acceptors has been developed. To test the theoretical predictions of this system, we carried out FRET studies using a 30-mer oligonucleotide-avidin system that was labeled with the acceptors DyLight649 or Dylight750. The opposite 5'-end of the oligonucleotide was labeled with the Alexa568 donor. We observed significantly enhanced energy transfer due to presence of multiple acceptors on the avidin protein. The results and simulation indicate that use of a nanosized body that has been randomly labeled with multiple acceptors allows FRET measurements to be extended to over 150 Å when using commercially available probes and established protein-labeling protocols. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","DNA; Enhanced transfer efficiency; FRET; Interactions at distances greater than 100 Å; Multiple acceptors","avidin; biotin; fluorescent dye; oligonucleotide; article; chemical model; chemistry; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; methodology; Avidin; Biotin; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; Models, Chemical; Oligonucleotides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861451539

Because IP is induced rapidly and maintained long-term, it likely represents a major determinant of adaptive collective neuronal dynamics. However, assessing the exact impact of IP has remained elusive. Indeed, it is extremely difficult disentangling the complex non-linear interaction between IP effects, by which conductance changes alter neuronal activity, and IP rules, whereby activity modifies conductance via signaling pathways. Moreover, the two major IP effects on firing rate, threshold and gain modulation, remain unknown in their very mechanisms. Here, using extensive simulations and sensitivity analysis of Hodgkin-Huxley models, we show that threshold and gain modulation are accounted for by maximal conductance plasticity of conductance that situate in two separate domains of the parameter space corresponding to sub- and supra-threshold conductance (i.e. activating below or above the spike onset threshold potential). Analyzing equivalent integrate-and-fire models, we provide formal expressions of sensitivities relating to conductance parameters, unraveling unprecedented mechanisms governing IP effects. Our results generalize to the IP of other conductance parameters and allow strong inference for calcium-gated conductance, yielding a general picture that accounts for a large repertoire of experimental observations. The expressions we provide can be combined with IP rules in rate or spiking models, offering a general framework to systematically assess the computational consequences of IP of pharmacologically identified conductance with both fine grain description and mathematical tractability. We provide an example of such IP loop model addressing the important issue of the homeostatic regulation of spontaneous discharge. Because we do not formulate any assumptions on modification rules, the present theory is also relevant to other neural processes involving excitability changes, such as neuromodulation, development, aging and neural disorders. © 2012 Naudé et al.",,"article; calcium conductance; cell aging; coding; Hodgkin Huxley equation; mathematical computing; nerve cell differentiation; nerve cell excitability; nerve cell membrane conductance; nerve cell membrane potential; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; process model; sensitivity analysis; spike wave; theory; action potential; animal; biological model; computer simulation; nerve cell network; physiology; regression analysis; Action Potentials; Animals; Computer Simulation; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857467287

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic skills training at home using inexpensive trainer boxes. Residents (n = 20, postgraduate years 15) enrolled in an institutional review boardapproved laparoscopic skills training protocol. An instructional video was reviewed, and baseline testing was performed using the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) peg transfer and suturing tasks. Participants were randomized to home training with inexpensive, self-contained trainer boxes or to simulation center training using standard video trainers. Discretionary, goal-directed training of at least 1 hour per week was encouraged. A posttest and retention test were performed. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons as well as the relationship between the suture score and the total training sessions, the time in training, and attempts were studied. Intragroup comparisons showed significant improvement from baseline to the posttest and the retention test. No differences were shown between the groups. The home-trained group practiced more, and the number of sessions correlated with suture retention score (r 2 =.54, P &lt;.039). Home training results in laparoscopic skill acquisition and retention.

However, with this self-learning strategy, there is a lack of direct supervision from experts and residents risk understudying for this high-stakes exam. Our objective is to determine study goals for effective selfguided practice for the FLS manual skills tasks that will result in passing the examination. Methods: FLS manual skills data for all PGY-5 residents during 2009-2010 was supplied by the FLS administrative office. Descriptive statistics were performed, and data were regrouped by the pass/fail results of the exam. The minimum practice time requirement for passing each manual skills task is reported in order to guide practice. Results: 1,047 proctored FLS exams were completed by 2009-2010 residents. Mean task time achieved by all residents was 84 ± 31 s for peg transfer, 139 ± 54 s for pattern cut, 78 ± 29 s for endoloop, 158 ± 66 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 168 ± 77 s for intracorporeal suturing. In the pass group (n = 988), mean time to complete each task was 80 s for peg transfer, 134 s for pattern cut, 75 s for endoloop, 148 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 160 s for intracorporeal suturing. Calculations suggest a self-study goal for each task of 53 s for peg transfer, 50 s for pattern cut, 87 s for endoloop, 99 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 96 s for intracorporeal suturing. If a resident can reliably achieve these results during self-study, they have an 84 % chance of passing the exam. Conclusions: Residents preparing to take the FLS exam can refer to data presented in this study to set practice goals. Referring to these data-based practice goals will help residents to improve their chances of passing this highstakes exam. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery program; Residency training; Simulation; Skills training; Surgical education","article; education program; human; laparoscopic surgery; medical practice; practice guideline; priority journal; professional competence; skill retention; study skills; surgical training; suturing method; task performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871623497

In this method, a high-pressure hydraulic system is utilized to transfer the energy produced from a wind turbine to a central generator. The speed control of wind driven hydraulic machinery is challenging, since the intermittent nature of wind imposes the fluctuation on the wind power generation and consequently varies the frequency of voltage. On the other hand, as the load of the generators increases, the frequency of the voltage drops. Therefore, hydraulically connected wind turbine and generator need to be controlled to maintain the frequency and compensate for the power demands. This paper introduces a closed loop gain scheduling flow control technique to maintain a constant frequency at the wind turbine generator. The governing equations of the renewable energy transfer system are derived and used to design the control system. The mathematical model is verified with a detailed model built using the SimHydraulics toolbox of MATLAB. The speed control profile obtained from a gain scheduling PI controller demonstrates a high performance speed regulation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the control technique. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Closed loop gain; Constant frequency; Control profiles; Control techniques; Detailed models; Flow control techniques; Gain Scheduling; Governing equations; Hydraulic system; PI Controller; Power demands; Power transfers; Renewable energies; Speed regulation; Voltage drop; Computer simulation; Electric power generation; Energy transfer; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Industrial electronics; Mathematical models; MATLAB; Scheduling; Speed control; Wind power; Wind turbines; Hydraulic motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856554537

Negligence in securing these systems makes them vulnerable to hacking attacks, which may lead to significant monetary losses for both merchants and the financial organizations. To reduce this risk, mandatory security compliance regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), were developed and adopted by the industry. A key pre-requisite of the PCI DSS compliance process is the ability to identify the components of the payment systems directly involved with the card data (i.e. process, transmit, or store). However, existing data flow tracking tools cannot fully automate the process of identifying system components that touch card data, because they either can not examine encrypted communications or they use an instrumentation-based approach and thus require a priori detailed knowledge of the payment card processing systems. We describe the implementation and evaluation of a novel tool to identify the card data flow in commercial payment card processing systems running on virtualized servers. The tool performs realtime monitoring of network communications between virtual machines and inspects the memory of the communicating processes for unencrypted card data. Our implementation does not require instrumentation of application binaries and can accurately identify the system components involved in card data flow even when the communications among system components are encrypted. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the card data flow of several open- and closed-source payment card processing applications.

This feature is a key property of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) synaptic learning rule, which has been shown tomaximize the selectivity of the postsynaptic neuron, and thereby offers a possible explanation for experience-dependent cortical plasticity such as orientation selectivity. However, the BCM framework is rate-based and a significant amount of recent work has shown that synaptic plasticity also depends on the precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. Here we consider a triplet model of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that depends on the interactions of three precisely timed spikes. Triplet STDP has been shown to describe plasticity experiments that the classical STDP rule, based on pairs of spikes, has failed to capture. In the case of rate-based patterns, we show a tight correspondence between the triplet STDP rule and the BCM rule. We analytically demonstrate the selectivity property of the triplet STDP rule for orthogonal inputs and perform numerical simulations for nonorthogonal inputs. Moreover, in contrast to BCM, we show that triplet STDP can also induce selectivity for input patterns consisting of higher-order spatiotemporal correlations, which exist in natural stimuli and have been measured in the brain. We show that this sensitivity to higher-order correlations can be used to develop direction and speed selectivity.",,"article; Bienenstock Cooper Munro rule; correlation analysis; linear system; machine learning; mathematical model; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; orientation; postsynaptic potential; presynaptic potential; priority journal; probability; spike timing dependent plasticity model; spike wave; synaptic inhibition; synaptic transmission; visual cortex; Action Potentials; Computer Simulation; Models, Neurological; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Synaptic Transmission; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82755167950

Four stimulus categories were defined on the basis of whether or not the dots were arranged collinearly and whether or not the central dot was equally spaced relative to the two flanking dots. Observers were initially trained with feedback to identify these categories at a single orientation with a fixed uniform background, and then they were tested with variable orientations and backgrounds without feedback. The results revealed almost perfect generalization. We also simulated the same task using a recent feature hierarchy model (J. Mutch & D. G. Lowe, 2008) that is among the most successful for object recognition. This model performed well for fixed orientations and backgrounds, but it could not accurately identify these categories with variable orientations and backgrounds even when given training with those conditions.

In expression studies, the issue of variance heteroscedasticity has received much attention, and previous work has focused on either between-gene or within-gene heteroscedasticity. However, in a single experiment, heteroscedasticity may exist both within and between genes. Here we develop flexible shrinkage error estimators considering both between-gene and within-gene heteroscedasticity and use them to construct F-like test statistics for testing interactions, with cutoff values obtained by permutation. These permutation tests are complicated, and several permutation tests are investigated here.Results: Our proposed test statistics are compared with other existing shrinkage-type test statistics through extensive simulation studies and a real data example. The results show that the choice of permutation procedures has dramatically more influence on detection power than the choice of F or F-like test statistics. When both types of gene heteroscedasticity exist, our proposed test statistics can control preselected type-I errors and are more powerful. Raw data permutation is not valid in this setting. Whether unrestricted or restricted residual permutation should be used depends on the specific type of test statistic.Conclusions: The F-like test statistic that uses the proposed flexible shrinkage error estimator considering both types of gene heteroscedasticity and unrestricted residual permutation can provide a statistically valid and powerful test. Therefore, we recommended that it should always applied in the analysis of real gene expression data analysis to test an interaction term. © 2011 Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Extensive simulations; Gene expression analysis; Gene Expression Data; Gene expression data analysis; Heteroscedasticity; Permutation procedures; Permutation tests; Residual variance; Shrinkage; Statistical tests; Statistics; Gene expression; animal; article; biological model; Drosophila; Drosophila melanogaster; gene expression profiling; genetics; male; statistical model; Animals; Drosophila; Drosophila melanogaster; Gene Expression Profiling; Male; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80055053503

However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This major function of STP has recently been challenged, however, by several computational studies indicating that transmission of information by dynamic synapses is broadband, i.e., frequency independent. Here we developed an analytical approach to quantify time- and rate-dependent synaptic information transfer during arbitrary spike trains using a realistic model of synaptic dynamics in excitatory hippocampal synapses. We found that STP indeed increases information transfer in a wide range of input rates, which corresponds well to the naturally occurring spike frequencies at these synapses. This increased information transfer is observed both during Poisson-distributed spike trains with a constant rate and during naturalistic spike trains recorded in hippocampal place cells in exploring rodents. Interestingly, we found that the presence of STP in low release probability excitatory synapses leads to optimization of information transfer specifically for short high-frequency bursts, which are indeed commonly observed in many excitatory hippocampal neurons. In contrast, more reliable high release probability synapses that express dominant short-term depression are predicted to have optimal information transmission for single spikes rather than bursts. This prediction is verified in analyses of experimental recordings from high release probability inhibitory synapses in mouse hippocampal slices and fits well with the observation that inhibitory hippocampal interneurons do not commonly fire spike bursts. We conclude that STP indeed contributes significantly to synaptic information transfer and may serve to maximize information transfer for specific firing patterns of the corresponding neurons. © 2011 the authors.",,"animal cell; animal tissue; article; brain nerve cell; hippocampus; information processing; mouse; nerve cell excitability; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; Poisson distribution; priority journal; quantitative analysis; short term plasticity; spike wave; statistical analysis; statistical model; synapse; synaptic potential; synaptic transmission; transport kinetics; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Computer Simulation; Electric Stimulation; Hippocampus; Mice; Models, Neurological; Neuronal Plasticity; Nonlinear Dynamics; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Predictive Value of Tests; Probability; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054015928

Opportunities to develop teamwork skills and expertise to mitigate risks are few. Our objective was to assess whether simulation would improve technical and nontechnical skills in dealing with ECMO circuit emergencies and allow transfer of skills from the simulated setting to clinical environment. Methods: Subjects were ECMO circuit providers who performed scenarios utilizing an infant simulator and functional ECMO circuit, followed immediately by video-assisted debriefings. Within the simulation laboratory, outcomes were timed responses, percentage of correct actions, teamwork, safety knowledge, and attitudes. Identification of latent safety threats (LSTs) was the focus of debriefings. Within the clinical setting, translation of learned skills was assessed by measuring circuit readiness and compliance with a cannulation initiation checklist. Results: Nineteen subjects performed 96 simulations during enrollment. In the laboratory, there was no improvement in timed responses or percent correct actions. Teamwork (P = 0.001), knowledge (P = 0.033), and attitudes (P = 0.001) all improved compared with baseline. Debriefing identified 99 LSTs. Clinically, 26 cannulations occurred during enrollment. Median time from blood available to circuit readiness was 17 minutes (range, 5-95), with no improvement during the study. Compliance with the initiation checklist improved compared with prestudy baseline (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Simulation-based training is an effective method to improve safety knowledge, attitudes, and teamwork surrounding ECMO emergencies. On-going training is feasible and allows identification of LSTs. Further work is needed to assess translation of learned skills and behaviors into the clinical environment.

One method of training for such environments culminates in practice in high-fidelity, highly stressful simulations. For some domains, realism necessitates large-scale, difficult-to-modify physical simulations. This necessity often results in repeated exposure to one or very few scenarios. The literature gives reason to question whether the stress reduction effects of such exposure transfer to new scenarios.Method: Anxiety and cognitive difficulties were measured among firefighter trainees during three live-fire drills. For each trainee, two drills involved the same scenario, and the other involved a new scenario that was structurally similar to the repeated scenario.Results: As predicted, anxiety and cognitive difficulties decreased across repetitions of the same scenario. However, the reduction did not generalize to a new scenario, and a nontrivial portion of the sample showed signs of negative transfer.Conclusion: Repeated exposure to the same stressful scenario as the final phase of training has limited practical value for stress reduction. Methods for expanding the range of scenarios to which trainees are exposed or for increasing the value of the exposure are recommended.Application: The findings could help improve design of training programs for high-reliability occupations. © 2011, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","acute stress; affective outcomes; extreme environments; transfer of training","affective outcomes; Complex environments; Extreme environment; High fidelity; High-reliability; Live-fire; Live-fire exercise; Physical simulation; Stress reduction; Time pressures; Training program; Drills; Employment; Fire extinguishers; Reliability; Uncertainty analysis; Personnel training; adult; anxiety; article; female; fire; human; learning; male; mental stress; methodology; occupation; social control; task performance; vocational education; Adult; Anxiety; Female; Fires; Humans; Male; Occupations; Social Control, Formal; Stress, Psychological; Task Performance and Analysis; Transfer (Psychology); Vocational Education; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053002765

To address this challenge, we developed a scheme for reducing the geometric complexity; while preserving the essential features of activity in both the soma and a remote dendritic spine. We merged our previously published biochemical model of calcium dynamics and lipid signaling in the Purkinje neuron, developed in the Virtual Cell modeling and simulation environment, with an electrophysiological model based on a Purkinje neuron model available in NEURON. A novel reduction method was applied to the Purkinje neuron geometry to obtain a model with fewer compartments that is tractable in Virtual Cell. Most of the dendritic tree was subject to reduction, but we retained the neuron's explicit electrical and geometric features along a specified path from spine to soma. Further, unlike previous simplification methods, the dendrites that branch off along the preserved explicit path are retained as reduced branches. We conserved axial resistivity and adjusted passive properties and active channel conductances for the reduction in surface area, and cytosolic calcium for the reduction in volume. Rallpacks are used to validate the reduction algorithm and show that it can be generalized to other complex neuronal geometries. For the Purkinje cell, we found that current injections at the soma were able to produce similar trains of action potentials and membrane potential propagation in the full and reduced models in NEURON; the reduced model produces identical spiking patterns in NEURON and Virtual Cell. Importantly, our reduced model can simulate communication between the soma and a distal spine; an alpha function applied at the spine to represent synaptic stimulation gave similar results in the full and reduced models for potential changes associated with both the spine and the soma.

An important problem, though, is how complex tasks can be represented in a way that enables efficient learning. We consider this problem through the lens of spatial navigation, examining how two of the brain's location representations-hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells-are adapted to serve as basis functions for approximating value over space for RL. Although much previous work has focused on these systems' roles in combining upstream sensory cues to track location, revisiting these representations with a focus on how they support this downstream decision function offers complementary insights into their characteristics. Rather than localization, the key problem in learning is generalization between past and present situations, which may not match perfectly. Accordingly, although neural populations collectively offer a precise representation of position, our simulations of navigational tasks verify the suggestion that RL gains efficiency from the more diffuse tuning of individual neurons, which allows learning about rewards to generalize over longer distances given fewer training experiences. However, work on generalization in RL suggests the underlying representation should respect the environment's layout. In particular, although it is often assumed that neurons track location in Euclidean coordinates (that a place cell's activity declines ""as the crow flies"" away from its peak), the relevant metric for value is geodesic: the distance along a path, around any obstacles. We formalize this intuition and present simulations showing how Euclidean, but not geodesic, representations can interfere with RL by generalizing inappropriately across barriers. Our proposal that place and grid responses should be modulated by geodesic distances suggests novel predictions about how obstacles should affect spatial firing fields, which provides a new viewpoint on data concerning both spatial codes. © 2011 Gustafson, Daw.",,"animal cell; article; brain function; cell function; cell population; cell tracking; cellular distribution; controlled study; hippocampus; neuroanatomy; neuronavigation; nonhuman; rat; reinforcement; simulation; task performance; animal; behavior; biological model; computer simulation; cytology; entorhinal cortex; hippocampus; maze test; nerve cell; physiology; Animals; Computer Simulation; Entorhinal Cortex; Hippocampus; Maze Learning; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Rats; Reinforcement (Psychology); Spatial Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80055084825

The phenomenon of "" rule learning"" -quick learning of abstract regularities from exposure to a limited set of stimuli-has become an important model system for understanding generalization in infancy. Experiments with adults and children have revealed differences in performance across domains and types of rules. To understand the representational and inferential assumptions necessary to capture this broad set of results, we introduce three ideal observer models for rule learning. Each model builds on the next, allowing us to test the consequences of individual assumptions. Model 1 learns a single rule, Model 2 learns a single rule from noisy input, and Model 3 learns multiple rules from noisy input. These models capture a wide range of experimental results-including several that have been used to argue for domain-specificity or limits on the kinds of generalizations learners can make-suggesting that these ideal observers may be a useful baseline for future work on rule learning. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial language learning; Bayesian modeling; Generalization; Infant development; Language acquisition","article; human; ideal observer model; language; learning; nerve cell network; noise; observer variation; priority journal; probability; rule learning; simulation; speech therapy; training; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Computer Simulation; Humans; Infant; Language Development; Learning; Models, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959772807

A broad class of models, originating with the Reichardt correlator model, proposes that animals estimate motion by computing a temporal cross-correlation of light intensities from two neighboring points in visual space. These models provide a good description of experimental data in specific contexts but cannot explain motion percepts in stimuli lacking pairwise correlations. Here, we develop a theoretical formalism that can accommodate diverse stimuli and behavioral goals. To achieve this, we treat motion estimation as a problem of Bayesian inference. Pairwise models emerge as one component of the generalized strategy for motion estimation. However, correlation functions beyond second order enable more accurate motion estimation. Prior expectations that are asymmetric with respect to bright and dark contrast use correlations of both even and odd orders, and we show that psychophysical experiments using visual stimuli with symmetric probability distributions for contrast cannot reveal whether the subject uses odd-order correlators for motion estimation. This result highlights a gap in previous experiments, which have largely relied on symmetric contrast distributions. Our theoretical treatment provides a natural interpretation of many visual motion percepts, indicates that motion estimation should be revisited using a broader class of stimuli, demonstrates how correlation-based motion estimation is related to stimulus statistics, and provides multiple experimentally testable predictions.","Drosophila; Motion energy; Neuroscience; Sensory perception; Vision","article; Bayes theorem; depth perception; human; light intensity; motion analysis system; perceptive threshold; photoreceptor; priority journal; vision; visual adaptation; visual field; visual stimulation; Algorithms; Animals; Computer Simulation; Models, Neurological; Motion; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Time Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961222401

Our panel was tasked with summarizing the ""best evidence."" We addressed the following question: To what extent does simulation support learning and teaching in procedural skills? Methods: We conducted a literature search from 2000 to 2010 using Medline, CINAHL, ERIC, and PSYCHINFO databases. Inclusion criteria were established and then data extracted from abstracts according to several categories. Although secondary sources of literature were sourced from key informants and participants at the ""Research Consensus Summit: State of the Science,"" they were not included in the data extraction process but were used to inform discussion. Results: Eighty-one of 1,575 abstracts met inclusion criteria. The uses of simulation for learning and teaching procedural skills were diverse. The most commonly reported simulator type was manikins (n = 17), followed by simulated patients (n = 14), anatomic simulators (eg, part-task) (n = 12), and others. For research design, most abstracts (n = 52) were at Level IV of the National Health and Medical Research Council classification (ie, case series, posttest, or pretest/posttest, with no control group, narrative reviews, and editorials). The most frequent Best Evidence Medical Education ranking was for conclusions probable (n = 37). Using the modified Kirkpatrick scale for impact of educational intervention, the most frequent classification was for modification of knowledge and/or skills (Level 2b) (n = 52). Abstracts assessed skills (n = 47), knowledge (n = 32), and attitude (n = 15) with the majority demonstrating improvements after simulation-based interventions. Studies focused on immediate gains and skills assessments were usually conducted in simulation. Discussion: The current state of the science finds that simulation usually leads to improved knowledge and skills. Learners and instructors express high levels of satisfaction with the method. While most studies focus on short-term gains attained in the simulation setting, a small number support the transfer of simulation learning to clinical practice. Further study is needed to optimize the alignment of learner, instructor, simulator, setting, and simulation for learning and teaching procedural skills. Instructional design and educational theory, contextualization, transferability, accessibility, and scalability must all be considered in simulation-based education programs. More consistently, robust research designs are required to strengthen the evidence.

This integrative view has important medical implications: the specific state of a patient characterized by a set of biophysical characteristics ultimately determines the optimal therapeutic treatment. Through the same view, we further demonstrate the potentiation effect of rational polypharmacy in the treatment of epilepsy and provide a new angle to resolve the debate on polypharmacy.

We describe here simulations to model the interaction of a focused FEL pulse with metallic solids (niobium, vanadium, and their deuterides) at 13.5 nm wavelength (92 eV) with peak intensities between 1015 to 10 18 W/cm2 and a fixed pulse length of 15 femtoseconds (full width at half maximum). The interaction of the pulse with the metallic solids was modeled with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium code that included radiation transfer. The calculations also made use of a self-similar isothermal fluid model for plasma expansion into vacuum. We find that the time-evolution of the simulated critical charge density in the sample results in a critical depth that approaches the observed crater depths in an earlier experiment performed at the FLASH free electron laser in Hamburg. The results show saturation in the ablation process at intensities exceeding 1016 W/cm2. Furthermore, protons and deuterons with kinetic energies of several keV have been measured, and these concur with predictions from the plasma expansion model.

Free-space optics (FSO) holds the potential for high bandwidth communication in such situations with relatively low cost, low maintenance, quick installation times, and average 70-80% connectivity. Since atmospheric conditions can significantly affect the capability of this type of communication system to transfer information consistently and operate effectively, the effects of atmosphere on FSO communication and consequent optimal wavelength range for transmission are investigated through MODTRAN-based modeling of 1.55 μm transmission. Simulations were performed for multiple elevation angles in atmospheric weather conditions including clear maritime, desert extinction, and various levels of rain and fog to simulate surface-to-surface and surface-to-air FSO communication networks. Atmospheric, free-space, and scintillation losses are analyzed for optical path lengths of up to 2 km or greater to determine minimum transmit power required for successful data reception. In addition, the effects of atmospheric turbulence on beam propagation in the evaporation layer are investigated, where wavefront sensing with adaptive optics as well as a software Kalman filter are seen as a means to compensate for wavefront distortion. Using advanced laser sources to provide illumination at infrared wavelengths, particularly around the eye-safe 1.55 μm wavelength, it should be possible to overcome many transmission limitations associated with atmospheric conditions such as adverse weather and turbulence to enable high data rate communication links where the use of fiber is not practical or prohibited. © 2011 SPIE.","Communication networks; Free-space optics; Infrared lasers; MODTRAN","Adverse weather; Atmospheric conditions; Beam propagation; Data reception; Elevation angle; Eye-safe; Free space; Free Space Optical communication; Free space optics; High bandwidth communication; High data rate communications; Infrared wavelengths; Laser sources; Low costs; Low maintenance; MODTRAN; Optical path lengths; Optimal wavelength; Remote location; Sea surfaces; Transfer information; Transmission limitations; Transmit power; Wave-front sensing; Wavefront distortion; Weather conditions; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Atmospheric turbulence; Communication; Computer simulation; Evaporation; Infrared lasers; Optics; Phase transitions; Sensors; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication systems; Wavefronts; Optical communication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960397052

Both features, however, are frequently challenged by individual self-interest. In fact, the stability of social and economic systems can suddenly break down as the recent financial crisis and outbreaks of civil wars illustrate. To understand the conditions for the emergence and robustness of social cohesion, we simulate the creation of public goods among mobile agents, assuming that behavioral changes are determined by individual satisfaction. Specifically, we study a generalized win-stay-lose-shift learning model, which is only based on previous experience and rules out greenbeard effects that would allow individuals to guess future gains. The most noteworthy aspect of this model is that it promotes cooperation in social dilemma situations despite very low information requirements and without assuming imitation, a shadow of the future, reputation effects, signaling, or punishment. We find that moderate greediness favors social cohesion by a coevolution between cooperation and spatial organization, additionally showing that those cooperation-enforcing levels of greediness can be evolutionarily selected. However, a maladaptive trend of increasing greediness, although enhancing individuals'returns in the beginning, eventually causes cooperation and social relationships to fall apart. Our model is, therefore, expected to shed light on the long-standing problem of the emergence and stability of cooperative behavior.",,"article; behavior change; coevolution; cooperation; human; imitation; model; priority journal; punishment; satisfaction; simulation; social behavior; social interaction; Cooperative Behavior; Emigration and Immigration; Game Theory; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Psychological; Population Density; Psychology; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960988404

This paper reports a novel procedure to characterize static multivariable ankle mechanical impedance. An experimental protocol using a wearable therapeutic robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable measurement of torque and angle data in multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, a combination of inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion. The measured multivariable torque-angle relation was represented as a vector field, and approximated using a method based on thin-plate spline smoothing with generalized cross validation. The vector field enabled assessment of several important characteristics of static ankle mechanical impedance, which are not available from prior single degree of freedom studies: the directional variation of ankle mechanical impedance, the extent to which the ankle behaves as a spring, and evidence of uniquely neural contributions. The method was validated by testing a simple physical ""mock-up"" consisting of passive elements. Experiments with young unimpaired subjects quantified the behavior of the maximally relaxed human ankle, showing that ankle mechanical impedance is spring-like but strongly direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion.

Because of the highly technical nature and the steep learning curve, students and residents must learn laparoscopic skills before performing them in the operating room. To improve efficiency of learning and patient safety, research in simulation is essential. Two types of simulators currently in use include virtual reality and box trainers. Our study examined which simulator technique was most effective in teaching novice trainees laparoscopic techniques. Design: This is a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial that enrolled fourth-year medical students and surgical interns to participate in a supervised 6-month laparoscopic training program with either computer simulators or box trainers. Subjects were randomized and trained on appropriate laparoscopic camera skills, instrument handling, object positioning, dissection, ligation, suturing, and knot tying. Students within one group were not allowed to practice, learn or train on the opposing trainers. At time points 0, 2, and 6 months all subjects completed a series of laparoscopic exercises in a live porcine model, which were captured on DVD and scored by blinded expert investigators. Results: Scores improved overall from the pretest to subsequent tests after training with no difference between the virtual reality and box simulator groups. In the medical students specifically, there was overall improvement, and improvement in the needle-transfer and knot-tying skills specifically, with no difference between the box simulator and virtual reality groups. For the interns, both groups showed significant overall improvement with no difference between the virtual reality and box simulator groups or on individual skills. Conclusions: We conclude that laparoscopic simulator training improves surgical skills in novice trainees. We found both the box trainers and the virtual reality simulators are equally effective means of teaching laparoscopic skills to novice learners. © 2011 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","box trainers; laparoscopy; simulators; training; virtual reality","article; computer aided design; controlled study; endoscopic surgery; female; human; laparoscopy; male; medical student; patient safety; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; simulator; single blind procedure; skill; task performance; training; virtual reality; Animals; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Confidence Intervals; Curriculum; Disease Models, Animal; Education, Medical; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Learning Curve; Male; Models, Anatomic; Prospective Studies; Reference Values; Risk Assessment; Single-Blind Method; Students, Medical; Swine; Task Performance and Analysis; Time Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959708131

In a number of experimental settings, including synthetic genetic arrays, genetic perturbations and RNAi screens, scientists identify a small set of protein interactions of interest. A working hypothesis is often that these interactions are the observable phenotypes of some functional process, which is not directly observable. Confirmatory analysis requires finding other pairs of proteins whose interaction may be additional phenotypical evidence about the same functional process. Extant methods for finding additional protein interactions rely heavily on the information in the newly identified set of interactions. For instance, these methods leverage the attributes of the individual proteins directly, in a supervised setting, in order to find relevant protein pairs. A small set of protein interactions provides a small sample to train parameters of prediction methods, thus leading to low confidence. Results: We develop RBSets, a computational approach to ranking protein interactions rooted in analogical reasoning; that is, the ability to learn and generalize relations between objects. Our approach is tailored to situations where the training set of protein interactions is small, and leverages the attributes of the individual proteins indirectly, in a Bayesian ranking setting that is perhaps closest to propensity scoring in mathematical psychology. We find that RBSets leads to good performance in identifying additional interactions starting from a small evidence set of interacting proteins, for which an underlying biological logic in terms of functional processes and signaling pathways can be established with some confidence. Our approach is scalable and can be applied to large databases with minimal computational overhead. Our results suggest that analogical reasoning within a Bayesian ranking problem is a promising new approach for real-time biological discovery. © The Author(s) 2011.

In other words we create system commands for routers, bridges, and firewalls to force data transfers and system access to comply with the current policies and approved rules in order to control access and protect private, sensitive, and classified information. As operational needs and threat levels change, the rules are modified to accommodate the required response. It then falls on System Administrators to manually change the configuration of the devices they manage to adapt their operations accordingly. As our user communities continue to rely more heavily on mission information, and the enterprise systems and networks that provide it, our enterprise needs to progress to more automated techniques that enable authorized managers to dynamically update and manage policies in digital formats. Automated management of access rules that control privileges for accessing secure information and enterprise resources, enabled by Digital Policy and other Enterprise Security Management (ESM) capabilities provides the means for system administrators to dynamically respond to changing user needs, threat postures and other environmental factors. With the increased popularity of virtual environments and advent of cloud enterprise services, IA management concepts need to be reexamined. Traditional ESM solutions may be subjected to new classes of threats as physical control of the assets that implement those services are relinquished to virtual environments. Additional operational factors such as invoking critical processing, controlling access to information during processing, ensuring adequate protection of transactions within virtual environments and executing ESM provisions are also affected. The paper describes the relationships among relevant ESM enterprise services as they impact the ability to share and protect enterprise information. Central to this is the ability to adopt and manage digital policies within the enterprise environment. It describes the management functions that have to be supported, and the challenges that have to be addressed to ensure an effective implementation. Since the adoption of cloud services is becoming an important consideration for the evolution of enterprise architectures, the paper also explores the implications of shifting from traditional to virtual enterprise environments. © 2011 SPIE.",,"Access rules; Automated management; Automated techniques; Classified information; Cloud services; Control access; Digital format; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise device; Enterprise environment; Enterprise resources; Enterprise security-management; Enterprise services; Enterprise system; Environmental factors; Information sharing; Management functions; Operational factors; Operational needs; Physical control; Policy management; System access; System administrators; Threat levels; User communities; User need; Virtual enterprise; Virtual environments; Access control; Data transfer; Digital devices; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Information dissemination; Laws and legislation; Virtual corporation; Virtual reality; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959488162

Principal Findings: Here, we identify Iwr1 in a genetic screen designed to uncover proteins involved in Pol III transcription in S. cerevisiae. Iwr1 is important for Pol III transcription, because an iwr1 mutant strain shows reduced association of TBP and Pol III at Pol III promoters, a decreased rate of Pol III transcription, and lower steady-state levels of Pol III transcripts. Interestingly, an iwr1 mutant strain also displays reduced association of TBP to Pol I-transcribed genes and of both TBP and Pol II to Pol II-transcribed promoters. Despite this, rRNA and mRNA levels are virtually unaffected, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism compensating for the occupancy defect.

Thus, a tool to decompose TMS-evoked oscillations in the time-frequency domain on a millisecond timescale and on a broadband frequency range may help to understand information transfer across cortical oscillators. Some recent studies have employed algorithms based on the Wavelet Transform (WT) to study TMS-evoked EEG oscillations in healthy and pathological conditions. However, these methods do not allow to describe TMS-evoked EEG oscillations with high resolution in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Here, we first develop an algorithm based on Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) to compute statistically significant time-frequency spectra of TMS-evoked EEG oscillations on a single trial basis. Then, we compared the performances of the HHT-based algorithm with the WT-based one by applying both of them to a set of simulated signals. Finally, we applied both algorithms to real TMS-evoked potentials recorded in healthy or schizophrenic subjects. We found that the HHT-based algorithm outperforms the WT-based one in detecting the time onset of TMS-evoked oscillations in the classical EEG bands. These results suggest that the HHT-based algorithm may be used to study the communication between different cortical oscillators on a fine time scale. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cortical oscillators; Electroencephalogram; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Wavelet Transform","adult; algorithm; article; case report; controlled study; electroencephalogram; evoked response; female; hilbert huang transform; human; male; oscillation; priority journal; schizophrenia; simulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; wavelet transform; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Wavelet Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957763527

Method: For this study, 30 participants with no flying experience were assigned at random to a stress-trained treatment group or a control group. Stress training consisted of systematic pairing of skill acquisition in a flight simulator with stress coping mechanisms in the presence of a cold pressor. Control participants received identical flight skill acquisition training but without stress training. Participants then performed a stressful flying task in a Piper Archer aircraft. Results: Stress-trained research participants flew the aircraft more smoothly, as recorded by aircraft telemetry data, and generally better, as recorded by flight instructor evaluations, than did control participants. Conclusions: Introducing stress coping mechanisms during flight training improved performance in a stressful flying task. Application: The results of this study indicate that stress training during the acquisition of flight skills may serve to enhance pilot performance in stressful operational flight and, therefore, might mitigate the contribution of pilot stress to aircraft mishaps. © 2011, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","aviation safety; cold pressor; flight training; performance under stress; pilot performance; pilot training; stress coping; stress exposure training","Aviation safety; cold pressor; Flight training; performance under stress; Pilot performance; Pilot training; Aircraft accidents; Aircraft control; Flight simulators; Aircraft; adaptive behavior; adult; aerospace medicine; aircraft accident; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; male; mental stress; professional competence; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; task performance; Accidents, Aviation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Female; Humans; Male; Professional Competence; Stress, Psychological; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959686734

For FES systems that communicate with the nervous system, one critical component is the electrode interface through which the machine-body information transfer must occur. In this paper, we examine the influence of inhomogeneous tissue conductivities and positions of nodes of Ranvier on activation of myelinated axons for neuromuscular control as a function of electrode configuration. To evaluate these effects, we developed a high-resolution bioelectric model of a fascicle from a stained cross-section of cat sciatic nerve. The model was constructed by digitizing a fixed specimen of peripheral nerve, extruding the image along the axis of the nerve, and assigning each anatomical component to one of several different tissue types. Electrodes were represented by current sources in monopolar, transverse bipolar, and longitudinal bipolar configurations; neural activation was determined using coupled field-neuron simulations with myelinated axon cable models. We found that the use of an isotropic tissue medium overestimated neural activation thresholds compared with the use of physiologically based, inhomogeneous tissue medium, even after controlling for mean impedance levels. Additionally, the positions of the cathodic sources relative to the nodes of Ranvier had substantial effects on activation, and these effects were modulated by the electrode configuration. Our results indicate that physiologically based tissue properties cause considerable variability in the neural response, and the inclusion of these properties is an important component in accurately predicting activation.

Since data transfer may not be possible until stable routes are learned, it is not only critical for BGP to converge after any policy or topology changes, but it is important that the convergence be rapid. Unfortunately, the distributed and asynchronous nature of BGP in conjunction with local policies makes it difficult to analyze, particularly with respect to convergence behavior. We present a novel model which, to our knowledge, is the first one to permit analysis of convergence in the aggregate (i.e., over all message exchange orders between routers regarding route advertisements), rather than worst case behavior. We introduce the notion of probabilistic safety as requiring the probability of convergence to be 1. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition characterizing probabilistic safety that shows that probabilistic safety accommodates BGP configurations whose potential divergence stems solely from pathological message sequences. More generally, we show how to compute for any BGP configuration its probability of convergence. For probabilistically safe configurations, we present procedures for computing their expected time to converge as well as the probability distribution on their convergence times. The ability to compute these quantitative characteristics makes our work ""constructive"" and provides the basis for further understanding and deriving procedures for optimizing network characteristics. Finally, we simulate behavior of several networks and verify the consistency between our analysis and the simulations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The mobile phone's built in acceleration sensor provided a convenient way to measure wrist movements and to run the behavioral protocol. Subjects moved a cursor on the screen by tilting the phone. Movements on the screen toward the training target were rotated and we then measured how learning of the rotation in the training direction affected subsequent movements in other directions.

Research shows that players drawn to the interpersonal dimensions of online games are more prone to experience negative outcomes associated with their computer use. Our study suggests that it is not only whether online gamers seek meaningful social interactions that determine if WoW play becomes problematic, but exactly how players interact with others in online game-worlds. Specifically, levels of problematic WoW play depend on the extent gamers play with offline or 'real-life' friends and relations. Our survey data reveals both a direct relationship between playing WoW with offline friends and problematic online gaming and also an indirect one mediated by 'immersion' (defined as the extent that players feel like they are in a virtual world and in some cases actually their character). Interpreting these results through ethnographic and interview data, we suggest that playing WoW with real-life-friends allows gamers to transfer in-game accomplishments and experiences into offline social networks. Rather than competing and conflicting with the world outside of the game, WoW played in this way tends to enhance gamers' offline lives. Further, by keeping gamers in touch with perspectives outside of WoW, playing with real-life-friends instills critical distance and greater awareness of how excessive play can damage offline commitments and relationships, allowing gamers to better monitor, evaluate, and ultimately regulate excessive game-play. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Moving or transferring patients is the dominant contributing event. A simulation educational approach has not been closely studied in this area but may have advantages over traditional approaches. Specific aims were to (1) evaluate the effect of a simulation intervention on success of patient transfers in a clinical setting and (2) measure change in participants' knowledge and attitude as a result of the intervention. METHODS: A prospective, observational, longitudinal design was used. Baseline patient transfer observations were conducted on control and intervention units. An optimum task set was developed using hierarchical task analysis methods. Subjects (N = 71) completed pre-and postintervention knowledge and attitude assessments. The intervention consisted of simulated patient transfers using a mannequin, education, and training, followed by repeated simulated transfers using a mannequin with debriefing. Observations of patient transfers in patient care areas were repeated at 4 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Patient transfer success improved from 66% at baseline to 88% at the 4-week measurement point (t = 7.447, P ≤ 0.0004). At 12 weeks, transfer success had decreased to 71%, with addition of new employees between weeks 4 and 12 confounding the 12-week measurement. Knowledge improved from a baseline of 65% to 95% postsimulation intervention (z =-6.634, P ≤ 0.0004). Attitude change was also evaluated with significance seen with 12 of 15 items (P ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A simulation intervention was successful in significantly improving knowledge and changing subject perceptions with regard to this task. Skills acquired through simulation successfully transferred to the clinical setting. Improvement in success for patient moves not trained in the simulation laboratory suggests that acquired skills were generalizable and supports application to different settings.

Methods: Thirty-four first-year (PG1) and 27 third-year (PG3) surgery residents (n = 61) from 6 training programs were tested. The OSCE consisted of 2 cases (End-of-Life [EOL] and Disclosure of Complications [DOC]). At each program, 2 clinicians and 2 standardized family members rated residents using case-specific tools. Performance was measured as the percentage of possible score obtained. We examined the generalizability of scores for each case separately. To assess construct validity, we compared PG1 with PG3 performance using repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results: The relative G-coefficient for EOL was .890. For DOC, the relative G-coefficient was .716. There were no significant performance differences between PG1 and PG3 residents.

The choice of an appropriate method, sample size, and allocation of cases and controls are serious concerns. To provide empirical guidelines for planning such studies and data analyses, we investigated the performance of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and generalized MDR (GMDR) methods under various experimental scenarios. We developed the mathematical expectation of accuracy and used it as an indicator parameter to perform a gene-gene interaction study. We then examined the statistical power of GMDR and MDR within the plausible range of accuracy (0.50~0.65) reported in the literature. The GMDR with covariate adjustment had a power of>80% in a case-control design with a sample size of≥2000, with theoretical accuracy ranging from 0.56 to 0.62. However, when the accuracy was<0.56, a sample size of≥4000 was required to have sufficient power. In our simulations, the GMDR outperformed the MDR under all models with accuracy ranging from 0.56~0.62 for a sample size of 1000-2000. However, the two methods performed similarly when the accuracy was outside this range or the sample was significantly larger. We conclude that with adjustment of a covariate, GMDR performs better than MDR and a sample size of 1000~2000 is reasonably large for detecting gene-gene interactions in the range of effect size reported by the current literature; whereas larger sample size is required for more subtle interactions with accuracy<0.56. © 2011 Chen et al.",,"accuracy; article; case control study; controlled study; gene interaction; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; multifactor dimensionality reduction; sample size; statistical analysis; study design; theoretical model; algorithm; biological model; computer simulation; evaluation; general aspects of disease; genetic epistasis; genetics; human; methodology; multifactor dimensionality reduction; physiology; reproducibility; statistical model; theoretical model; validation study; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Disease; Epistasis, Genetic; Humans; Logistic Models; Models, Genetic; Models, Theoretical; Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952217437

The important role of ROS in cell survival requires detailed investigation of mechanism and determinants of ROS production. To perform such an investigation we extended our rule-based model of complex III in order to account for electron transport in the whole RC coupled to proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential generation, TCA cycle reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. It fits respiratory electron fluxes measured in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I. The fitting of measured characteristics gave an insight into the mechanism of underlying processes governing the formation of free radicals that can transfer an unpaired electron to oxygen-producing superoxide and thus can initiate the generation of ROS. Our analysis revealed an association of ROS production with levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III. It was found that the phenomenon of bistability, revealed previously as a property of complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted based on theoretical analysis and were confirmed experimentally. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanisms of ROS production in RC. © 2011 Selivanov et al.",,"reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal cell; article; brain mitochondrion; controlled study; electron transport; enzyme substrate; mathematical model; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; proton motive force; proton transport; qualitative analysis; rat; respiratory chain; steady state; algorithm; animal; biology; brain; chemistry; citric acid cycle; computer simulation; electron; electron transport; metabolism; methodology; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; spectrofluorometry; Wistar rat; Rattus; Algorithms; Animals; ATP Synthetase Complexes; Brain; Citric Acid Cycle; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Electron Transport; Electrons; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reactive Oxygen Species; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953667930

However, previous studies have focused on the biomechanical properties of only the transferred muscle. We developed simulations of the tetraplegic upper limb following transfer of the brachioradialis (BR) to the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) to examine the influence of residual upper limb strength on predictions of post-operative transferred muscle function. Our simulations included the transfer, ECRB, ECRL, the three heads of the triceps, brachialis, and both heads of the biceps. Simulations were integrated with experimental data, including EMG and joint posture data collected from five individuals with tetraplegia and BR-FPL tendon transfers during maximal lateral pinch force exertions. Given a measured co-activation pattern for the non-paralyzed muscles in the tetraplegic upper limb, we computed the highest activation for the transferred BR for which neither the elbow nor the wrist flexor moment was larger than the respective joint extensor moment. In this context, the effects of surgical tensioning were evaluated by comparing the resulting pinch force produced at different muscle strength levels, including patient-specific scaling. Our simulations suggest that extensor muscle weakness in the tetraplegic limb limits the potential to augment total pinch force through surgical tensioning. Incorporating patient-specific muscle volume, EMG activity, joint posture, and strength measurements generated simulation results that were comparable to experimental results. Our study suggests that scaling models to the population of interest facilitates accurate simulation of post-operative outcomes, and carries utility for guiding and developing rehabilitation training protocols. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomechanical modeling; Lateral pinch; Simulation; Upper extremity; Upper limb function","Biomechanical modeling; Lateral pinch; Simulation; Upper extremity; Upper limb function; Biomechanics; Computer simulation; Joints (anatomy); Surgery; Tendons; Muscle; adult; arm muscle; article; biceps brachii muscle; biomechanics; brachioradialis muscle; clinical article; computer simulation; electromyography; experimental model; extensor muscle; flexor tendon; human; joint function; muscle function; muscle mass; muscle strength; muscle weakness; pinch strength; postoperative period; prediction; priority journal; quadriplegia; tendon transfer; triceps brachii muscle; Adult; Computer Simulation; Hand Strength; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Postural Balance; Quadriplegia; Stress, Mechanical; Tendon Transfer; Tensile Strength; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951722718

Graphical user interfaces were designed for interactive and intuitive use of the toolbox. Major functions of eConnectome include EEG/ECoG preprocessing, scalp spatial mapping, cortical source estimation, connectivity analysis, and visualization. Granger causality measures such as directed transfer function and adaptive directed transfer function were implemented to estimate the directional interactions of brain functional networks, over the scalp and cortical sensor spaces. Cortical current density inverse imaging was implemented using a generic realistic geometry brain-head model from scalp EEGs. Granger causality could be further estimated over the cortical source domain from the inversely reconstructed cortical source signals as derived from the scalp EEG.

A variety of quantitative techniques have been utilized to analyze the spiking activities of the neurons to elucidate the functional connectivity of the recorded neurons. In the past, researchers have used correlative measures. More recently, to better capture the dynamic, complex relationships present in the data, neuroscientists have employed causal measures-most of which are variants of Granger causality-with limited success. This paper motivates the directed information, an information and control theoretic concept, as a modality-independent embodiment of Grangers original notion of causality. Key properties include: (a) it is nonzero if and only if one process causally influences another, and (b) its specific value can be interpreted as the strength of a causal relationship. We next describe how the causally conditioned directed information between two processes given knowledge of others provides a network version of causality: it is nonzero if and only if, in the presence of the present and past of other processes, one process causally influences another. This notion is shown to be able to differentiate between true direct causal influences, common inputs, and cascade effects in more two processes. We next describe a procedure to estimate the directed information on neural spike trains using point process generalized linear models, maximum likelihood estimation and information-theoretic model order selection. We demonstrate that on a simulated network of neurons, it (a) correctly identifies all pairwise causal relationships and (b) correctly identifies network causal relationships. This procedure is then used to analyze ensemble spike train recordings in primary motor cortex of an awake monkey while performing target reaching tasks, uncovering causal relationships whose directionality are consistent with predictions made from the wave propagation of simultaneously recorded local field potentials. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Causality; Functional connectivity; Mutual information; Point processes","article; brain function; brain region; causal modeling; data analysis; directed information; entropy; experimental study; information; information science; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nerve cell network; neuroscience; priority journal; recording; spike wave; statistical analysis; theoretical study; transfer entropy; Action Potentials; Animals; Causality; Information Theory; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952280379

Brains and neuronal networks must at the same time store information about the world and react to information in the world. We sought to measure how the activity of the network alters information flow from inputs to output patterns. Using neocortical column neuronal network simulations, we demonstrated that networks with greater internal connectivity reduced input/output correlations from excitatory synapses and decreased negative correlations from inhibitory synapses, measured by Kendalls τ correlation. Both of these changes were associated with reduction in information flow, measured by normalized transfer entropy (nTE). Information handling by the network reflected the degree of internal connectivity. With no internal connectivity, the feedforward network transformed inputs through nonlinear summation and thresholding. With greater connectivity strength, the recurrent network translated activity and information due to contribution of activity from intrinsic network dynamics. This dynamic contribution amounts to added information drawn from that stored in the network. At still higher internal synaptic strength, the network corrupted the external information, producing a state where little external information came through. The association of increased information retrieved from the network with increased gamma power supports the notion of gamma oscillations playing a role in information processing. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Information transfer; Modeling; Neuronal networks; Simulation","4 aminobutyric acid; alpha amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; article; computer model; computer simulation; entropy; excitatory postsynaptic potential; information retrieval; information science; information storage; inhibitory postsynaptic potential; mathematical computing; neocortex; nerve cell network; neuroscience; nonlinear system; oscillation; priority journal; spike wave; synaptic transmission; transfer entropy; Action Potentials; alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid; Animals; Brain; Computer Simulation; Entropy; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Humans; Information Theory; Models, Neurological; Neocortex; Nerve Net; Neurons; Spectrum Analysis; Synapses; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952283205

METHODS: This study was part of a two-phase, randomized trial with a wait-list control condition assessing the effectiveness of a pediatric emergency medicine curriculum targeting general emergency medicine residents. Residents received 6 hours of instruction either before or after the first assessment. Separate pairs of raters completed either a dichotomous checklist for each of three cases or the Global Performance Assessment Tool (GPAT), an anchored multidimensional scale. A fully crossed person x rater x case generalizability study was conducted. The effect of training year on performance is assessed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: The person and person x case components accounted for most of the score variance for both instruments. Using either instrument, scores demonstrated a small but significant increase as training level increased when analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance. The inter-rater reliability coefficient was >0.9 for both instruments. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that our checklist and anchored global rating instrument performed in a psychometrically similar fashion with high reliability. As long as proper attention is given to instrument design and testing and rater training, checklists and anchored assessment scales can produce reproducible data for a given population of subjects. The validity of the data arising for either instrument type must be assessed rigorously and with a focus, when practicable, on patient care outcomes. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Checklists; Global assessment; Performance assessment","article; audiovisual equipment; checklist; clinical competence; clinical trial; computer simulation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; education; emergency medicine; human; medical education; methodology; pediatrics; psychometry; randomized controlled trial; Checklist; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Educational Measurement; Emergency Medicine; Humans; Internship and Residency; Manikins; Pediatrics; Psychometrics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951811051

Here, we measured activity patterns obtained from multisite local field potential recordings in cortex cultures, urethane-anesthetized rats, and awake macaque monkeys. First, we quantified the information capacity of the pattern repertoire of ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity using Shannon entropy. Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between stimulus and response using mutual information. By systematically changing the ratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in vitro and in a network model, we discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are maximized at a particular intermediate E/I, at which ongoing activity emerges as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to correctly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between neuronal groups during ongoing activity. Close agreement between our experiments and model suggest that neuronal avalanches and peak information capacity arise because of criticality and are general properties of cortical networks with balanced E/I.

Subjects participated in three experiments performed on separate days. Learning progressed rapidly on day 1, resulting in reduced target capture error and increased cursor trajectory linearity. On days 2 and 3, one group of subjects adapted to a rotation of the nominal map, imposed either stepwise or randomly over trials. Another group experienced a scaling distortion. We report two findings. First, adaptation rates and memory-dependent motor command updating depended on distortion type. Stepwise application and removal of the rotation induced a marked increase in finger motion variability but scaling did not, suggesting that the rotation initiated a more exhaustive search through the space of viable finger motions to resolve the target capture task than did scaling. Indeed, subjects formed new coordination patterns in compensating the rotation but relied on patterns established during baseline practice to compensate the scaling. These findings support the idea that the brain compensates direction and extent errors separately and in computationally distinct ways, but are inconsistent with the idea that once a task is learned, command updating is limited to those degrees of freedom contributing to performance (thereby minimizing energetic or similar costs of control). Second, we report that subjects who learned a scaling while moving to just one target generalized more narrowly across directions than those who learned a rotation. This contrasts with results from whole-arm reaching studies, where a learned scaling generalizes more broadly across direction than rotation. Based on inverse- and forward-dynamics analyses of reaching with the arm, we propose the difference in results derives from extensive exposure in reaching with familiar arm dynamics versus the novelty of the manual task.

For example, the ability to ride a bicycle or swing a racket is often first developed at lower speeds and later applied to faster velocities. A number of previous studies have examined the generalization of motor adaptation across movement directions and found that the learned adaptation decays in a pattern consistent with the existence of motor primitives that display narrow Gaussian tuning. However, few studies have examined the generalization of motor adaptation across movement speeds. Following adaptation to linear velocity-dependent dynamics during point-to-point reaching arm movements at one speed, we tested the ability of subjects to transfer this adaptation to short-duration higher-speed movements aimed at the same target. We found near-perfect linear extrapolation of the trained adaptation with respect to both the magnitude and the time course of the velocity profiles associated with the high-speed movements: a 69% increase in movement speed corresponded to a 74% extrapolation of the trained adaptation. The close match between the increase in movement speed and the corresponding increase in adaptation beyond what was trained indicates linear hypergeneralization. Computational modeling shows that this pattern of linear hypergeneralization across movement speeds is not compatible with previous models of adaptation in which motor primitives display isotropic Gaussian tuning of motor output around their preferred velocities. Instead, we show that this generalization pattern indicates that the primitives involved in the adaptation to viscous dynamics display anisotropic tuning in velocity space and encode the gain between motor output and motion state rather than motor output itself.",,"adaptation; anisotropy; arm movement; article; dynamics; human; human experiment; learning; motor activity; normal human; priority journal; velocity; Adaptation, Physiological; Anisotropy; Computer Simulation; Humans; Learning Curve; Linear Models; Motor Activity; Movement; Psychomotor Performance; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651420958

The technology is becoming mature enough to be widely available to the public and real-world computer vision applications start to emerge. A typical example of this trend is the gaming industry and the launch of Microsoft.'s new camera: the Kinect. Other domains, where gesture recognition is needed, include but are not limited to: sign language recognition, virtual reality environments and smart homes. A key challenge for such real-world applications is that they need to operate in complex scenes with cluttered backgrounds, various moving objects and possibly challenging illumination conditions. In this paper we propose a method that accommodates such challenging conditions by detecting the hands using scene depth information from the Kinect. On top of our detector we employ a dynamic programming method for recognizing gestures, namely Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Our method is translation and scale invariant which is a desirable property for many HCI systems. We have tested the performance of our approach on a digits recognition system. All experimental datasets include hand signed digits gestures but our framework can be generalized to recognize a wider range of gestures. © 2011 ACM.","DTW; Dynamic time warping; Gesture recognition; Kinect","Automation; Dynamic programming; Human computer interaction; Information use; Intelligent buildings; Virtual reality; Cluttered backgrounds; Computer vision applications; Dynamic programming methods; Dynamic time warping; Illumination conditions; Kinect; Sign Language recognition; Virtual-reality environment; Gesture recognition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858054098

This study aimed to characterize current surgeon impressions about LESS and to determine the relative difficulty of performing a simulated LESS task using a multiport access device. Methods: This study was conducted at the 2009 Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Learning Center. The 56 study participants were asked to complete pre- and post-test questionnaires regarding their level of training, prior clinical experience, and opinions about LESS. Technical skill performance was evaluated using the standardized fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery Peg Transfer task scored according to time and error metrics. The participants completed three repetitions: conventional laparoscopy (LAP), LESS with nonarticulated instruments (LESS Straight), and LESS with articulated instruments (LESS Articulating). Results: Complete data were collected for 45 (80%) of the 56 participants, which included 27 practicing surgeons, nine minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fellows, seven residents, and two allied health professionals. Five surgeons (LESS experienced) had managed at least one LESS case in the preceding 6 months. Participants rated their comfort with LESS as 2.0 ± 1.2 (5-point scale, 1 = very uncomfortable). Compared with conventional laparoscopy, the participants indicated that LESS had 97% better cosmesis, 25% decreased postoperative pain, 18% faster recovery, 97% more demanding, 73% increased rate of complications, and 82% anticipated wide adoption. They all indicated a readiness to offer LESS to their patients if appropriately trained. Peg Transfer performance was significantly worse for LESS than for LAP (40-65% performance decline), and for LESS Articulating than for LESS Straight (44% performance decline). Construct validity for the LESS simulated tasks was supported because the LESS-experienced scores were significantly better than the LESS-nonexpert scores. Conclusion: Despite the increased technical difficulty associated with the LESS approach, surgeons are enthusiastic about offering these techniques and seeking additional training. Robust simulation-based methods that foster skill acquisition through repetitive practice and verification of proficiency are needed such that safe adoption may be fostered. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Construct validity; Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery; LESS; Patient safety; Proficiency; Simulation; Single-incision laparoscopy","article; construct validity; controlled study; esthetics; experience; human; laparoendoscopic single site surgery; laparoscopy; minimally invasive surgery; paramedical profession; physician attitude; postoperative pain; priority journal; questionnaire; resident; scoring system; skill; surgeon; surgical instrument; surgical training; task performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051693753

A two-phase study was conducted to examine the performance of standardized tasks on a surgical simulator by novices during a distributed training period. Phase 1 examined the effect of LAP-specific or SIL-specific training on skill acquisition for both techniques. Phase 2 compared the effectiveness and learning curves of additional instrument types for SIL (straight [STR] vs. dynamic articulating [D-ART]). Methods: Medical students without previous surgical experience were randomized to LAP-specific training or SIL-specific training, using static articulating instruments [S-ART] for SIL. LAP and SIL scores on the peg transfer (PEG) and pattern cutting (CIRCLE) tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) were measured at baseline and after four training sessions. In phase 2, a new group of subjects were randomized to SIL training using STR or D-ART instruments, with similar baseline and post-training testing. FLS task scores were calculated and compared according to training regimen and instrument type. Results: Forty-five subjects completed the study. All scores improved significantly during the training period. Improvement in LAP score was similar between LAP-trained and SIL-trained groups. Improvement of SIL score was better for the SIL-trained group. Final scores were better and the learning curve was shorter for LAP versus SIL technique, with no differences in SIL scores according to instrument type. Conclusions: LAP technique results in superior task performance with a shorter learning curve compared with SIL technique during a standardized training period. SIL-specific simulator training is better than LAP training alone to improve SIL performance. Neither S-ART nor D-ART instruments for SIL are associated with improved performance or shorter learning curve compared with STR instruments. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Articulating; SILS™; Simulation; Single-incision laparoscopy; Single-port","article; clinical competence; controlled study; human; incision; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; learning curve; medical education; medical student; priority journal; simulator; surgical approach; surgical instrument; surgical technique; surgical training; task performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81955168088

Recent interest and widespread implementation of LESS stems from advancements in commercially available access port technology. Consequently, this study objectively compared the technical performance between conventional laparoscopic and LESS surgical ports in a modified Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) simulator. Methods: The 24 novice participants in this study performed the FLS peg transfer task using two conventional laparoscopic 12-mm working ports, the SILS port, the TriPort access system, and the GelPOINT system with two standard length 5-mm graspers. Each participant completed the task using conventional laparoscopy first for familiarization, followed by each of the three LESS surgical ports in random order. Task completion time, errors, and subjective questionnaire ratings were used to compare conventional laparoscopy and the single-port devices. Congruent with FLS scoring procedures, task completion time and errors were used to compute a standardized task score for each port. Results: The task score did not differ significantly between conventional laparoscopy and the single-port devices. Additionally, there were no task score differences between trials for either the SILS port or the GelPOINT system. There was a significant performance decrement starting with the TriPort versus starting with either the SILS port or the GelPOINT, which resulted in the lowest overall trial task score (p < 0.05). Task completion difficulty and instrument maneuverability resulted in no significant differences between ports. Ease of use and overall rank were significant, with conventional laparoscopy rated as the easiest to use and the highest overall followed by the GelPOINT system. Conclusions: Overall, the TriPort may be more challenging for novices to use in learning the LESS procedure than either the SILS port or the GelPOINT system. The GelPOINT system may offer the most consistent platform for LESS performance and novice skill acquisition. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Laparoscopy; SILS; Simulation; Single incision; Single port; Surgery","adult; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; intermethod comparison; laparoendoscopic single site surgery; laparoscopic surgery; male; normal human; operation duration; priority journal; questionnaire; scoring system; simulation; simulator; standardization; surgical approach; surgical error; surgical instrument; surgical technique; surgical training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960429090

The present work studied, for the first time to my knowledge, how humans adjust curved hand movements to a target that switches location. Subjects (n = 8) sat in front of a drawing tablet and looked at a screen. They moved a cursor on a curved trajectory (spiral or oval shaped) toward a goal point. In half of the trials, this goal switched 200 ms after movement onset to either one of two alternative positions, and subjects smoothly adjusted their movements to the new goal. To explain this adjustment, we compared three computational models: a superposition of curved and minimum-jerk movements (Flash and Henis in J Cogn Neurosci 3(3):220-230, 1991), Vector Planning (Gordon et al. in Exp Brain Res 99(1):97-111, 1994) adapted to curved movements (Rescale), and a nonlinear dynamical system, which could generate arbitrarily curved smooth movements and had a point attractor at the goal. For each model, we predicted the trajectory adjustment to the target switch by changing only the goal position in the model. As result, the dynamical model could explain the observed switch behavior significantly better than the two alternative models (spiral: P = 0.0002 vs. Flash, P = 0.002 vs. Rescale; oval: P = 0.04 vs. Flash; P values obtained from Wilcoxon test on R 2 values). We conclude that generalizing arbitrary hand trajectories to new targets may be explained by switching a single control command, without the need to re-plan or re-optimize the whole movement or superimpose movements. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Behavioral experiment; Computational model; Convergent force field; Curved movement; Dynamical system; Target switch","adult; arm movement; article; female; finger; hand movement; human; human experiment; male; mathematical model; normal human; priority journal; task performance; visual stimulation; Adult; Arm; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Movement; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78951490168

These two closed-loop gains provide a direct assessment of baroreflex control of heart rate (HR). In addition, the dynamic coherence, cross bispectrum, and their power ratio can also be estimated. All statistical indices provide a valuable quantitative assessment of the interaction between heartbeat dynamics and hemodynamics. To illustrate the application, we have applied the proposed point process model to experimental recordings from 11 healthy subjects in order to monitor cardiovascular regulation under propofol anesthesia. We present quantitative results during transient periods, as well as statistical analyses on steady-state epochs before and after propofol administration. Our findings validate the ability of the algorithm to provide a reliable and fast-tracking assessment of BRS, and show a clear overall reduction in baroreflex gain from the baseline period to the start of propofol anesthesia, confirming that instantaneous evaluation of arterial baroreflex control of HR may yield important implications in clinical practice, particularly during anesthesia and in postoperative care. © 2010 Biomedical Engineering Society.","Adaptive filters; Baroreflex control; Baroreflex sensitivity; Cardiovascular system; Closed-loop feedback control; Heart rate variability; Hemodynamics; Point processes; Volterra series","Baroreflex; Baroreflex sensitivities; Closed-loop feedback control; Heart rate variability; Point process; Volterra Series; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Anesthesiology; Blood pressure; Closed loop control systems; Electric filters; Feedback control; Flow control; Heart; Hemodynamics; Hydrodynamics; Probability distributions; Rating; Regression analysis; Adaptive control systems; anesthetic agent; propofol; adult; article; biological model; blood pressure; computer simulation; drug effect; female; heart rate; human; intravenous drug administration; male; methodology; oscillometry; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex; psychophysiology; statistical model; Anesthetics; Baroreflex; Biofeedback, Psychology; Blood Pressure; Computer Simulation; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Male; Models, Cardiovascular; Models, Statistical; Oscillometry; Propofol; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650855032

However, SILS™ may not allow the same level of manual dexterity and technical performance compared to LAP. We compared the performance of standardized tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program using either the LAP or the SILS™ technique. Methods Medical students, surgical residents, and attending physicians were recruited and divided into inexperienced (IE), laparoscopy-experienced (LE), and SILS™-experienced (SE) groups. Each subject performed standardized tasks from FLS, including peg transfer, pattern cutting, placement of ligating loop, and intracorporeal suturing using a standard three-port FLS box-trainer with standard laparoscopic instruments. For SILS™ the subjects used an FLS box-trainer modified to accept a SILS Port™ with two working ports for instruments and one port for a 30° 5-mm laparoscope. SILS™ tasks were performed with instruments capable of unilateral articulation. SILS™ suturing was performed both with and without an articulating EndoStitch™ device. Task scores, including cumulative laparoscopic FLS score (LS) and cumulative SILS™ FLS score (SS), were calculated using standard time and accuracy metrics. Results There were 27 participants in the study. SS was inferior to LS in all groups. LS increased with experience level, but was similar between LE and SE groups. SS increased with experience level and was different among all groups. SILS™ suturing using the articulating suturing device was superior to the use of a modified needle driver technique. Conclusions SILS™ is more technically challenging than standard laparoscopic surgery. Using currently available SILS™ platforms and instruments, even surgeons with SILS™ experience are unable to match their overall LAP performance. Specialized training curricula should be developed for inexperienced surgeons who wish to perform SILS™. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Laparoscopy; SILS™; Simulation; Single-incision; Single-port; Surgery","article; controlled study; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; simulator; single incision laparoscopic surgery; surgical equipment; suturing method; task performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954926573

It is a diarthrodial joint with opposing articular cartilage surfaces that provide a low friction environment and a ligamentous capsule that encloses the joint space. Together with the disc, the bilateral facet joints transfer loads and guide and constrain motions in the spine due to their geometry and mechanical function. Although a great deal of research has focused on defining the biomechanics of the spine and the form and function of the disc, the facet joint has only recently become the focus of experimental, computational and clinical studies. This mechanical behavior ensures the normal health and function of the spine during physiologic loading but can also lead to its dysfunction when the tissues of the facet joint are altered either by injury, degeneration or as a result of surgical modification of the spine. The anatomical, biomechanical and physiological characteristics of the facet joints in the cervical and lumbar spines have become the focus of increased attention recently with the advent of surgical procedures of the spine, such as disc repair and replacement, which may impact facet responses. Accordingly, this review summarizes the relevant anatomy and biomechanics of the facet joint and the individual tissues that comprise it. In order to better understand the physiological implications of tissue loading in all conditions, a review of mechanotransduction pathways in the cartilage, ligament and bone is also presented ranging from the tissue-level scale to cellular modifications. With this context, experimental studies are summarized as they relate to the most common modifications that alter the biomechanics and health of the spine—injury and degeneration. In addition, many computational and finite element models have been developed that enable more-detailed and specific investigations of the facet joint and its tissues than are provided by experimental approaches and also that expand their utility for the field of biomechanics. These are also reviewed to provide a more complete summary of the current knowledge of facet joint mechanics. Overall, the goal of this review is to present a comprehensive review of the breadth and depth of knowledge regarding the mechanical and adaptive responses of the facet joint and its tissues across a variety of relevant size scales. © 2011 by ASME.","Articular cartilage; Biomechanics; Capsule; Facet joint mechanics; Mechanotransduction; Spine","articular cartilage; biomechanics; cervical spine; computer simulation; finite element analysis; histology; human; injury; intervertebral disk hernia; joint capsule; joint characteristics and functions; ligament; lumbar vertebra; mechanical stress; mechanotransduction; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; review; spine; total disc replacement; zygapophyseal joint; anatomical concepts; Article; articular cartilage; biomechanics; disk prosthesis; facet joint; force; hyaline cartilage; joint capsule; joint laxity; ligament; lumbar spine; mathematical model; mechanotransduction; morphology; neurologic disease; nonhuman; pressure; simulation; spine injury; spine mobility; spine surgery; spondylarthritis; stress strain relationship; synovium; Biomechanics; Cartilage, Articular; Cervical Vertebrae; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Joint Capsule; Ligaments, Articular; Lumbar Vertebrae; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Range of Motion, Articular; Spine; Stress, Mechanical; Total Disc Replacement; Zygapophyseal Joint; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Cartilage; Finite element method; Histology; Physiological models; Physiology; Surgery; Tissue; Articular cartilages; Capsule; Facet joints; Mechanotransduction; Spine; Joints (anatomy)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009798772

This bacterium harbors a type IV secretion system (T4SS) highly similar to the Dot/Icm of Legionella pneumophila that is believed to be essential for its infectivity. Protein substrates of the Coxiella T4SS are predicted to facilitate the biogenesis of a phagosome permissive for its intracellular growth. However, due to the lack of genetic systems, protein transfer by the C. burnetii Dot/Icm has not been demonstrated. In this study, we report the identification of 32 substrates of the C. burnetii Dot/Icm system using a fluorescence-based β-lactamase (TEM1) translocation assay as well as the calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (CyaA) assay in the surrogate host L. pneumophila. Notably, 26 identified T4SS substrates are hypothetical proteins without predicted function. Candidate secretion substrates were obtained by using (i) a genetic screen to identify C. burnetii proteins interacting with DotF, a component of the T4SS, and (ii) bioinformatic approaches to retrieve candidate genes that harbor characteristics associated with previously reported substrates of the Dot/Icm system from both C. burnetii and L. pneumophila. Moreover, we have developed a shuttle plasmid that allows the expression of recombinant proteins in C. burnetii as TEM fusion products. Using this system, we demonstrated that a Dot/Icm substrate identified with L. pneumophila was also translocated by C. burnetii in a process that requires its C terminus, providing direct genetic evidence of a functional T4SS in C. burnetii.","Effectors; Protein translocation; Transporter","beta lactamase; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase; article; assay; bioinformatics; carboxy terminal sequence; Coxiella burnetii; enzyme assay; fluorescence; genetic screening; genetics; host; Legionella pneumophila; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein interaction; protein secretion; transmission electron microscopy; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Computational Biology; Coxiella burnetii; Genome, Bacterial; Legionella pneumophila; Protein Transport; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Bacteria (microorganisms); Coxiella; Coxiella burnetii; Legionella pneumophila",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650742007

Participants used a VR simulator that had a physical drill handle interfaced with a haptic force/torque feedback system. They practiced until they met a priori performance criteria and then repeated the procedure with a genuine drill and foam model of a skull. The results showed some positive transfer related to hand steadiness, but not for drilling time. The drilling model incorporated in the simulator may require more effort to maintain the drill position and more revolutions of the drill bit to penetrate the model skull. Thus, practice on the VR simulator enabled the participants to maintain better drill position on the physical model.

However, current systems place emphasis on language training, which is only part of the equation in effective communication. Knowledge about culturally dependent social norms directly impacts the interaction outcome. A dynamic, customizable, computationally tractable model for the code of conduct, or etiquette, can alert us of the specific communication protocols of groups of interest, and can prevent over-generalizations which can be detrimental to the end goal. We may not consciously care, or even be aware of etiquette, but it impacts our trust and affect for individuals, and ultimately shapes our subsequent actions. We have adapted a socio-linguistic model of human-human interaction for use in language and culture training. This computational model increases the social intelligence of virtual actors by allowing them to act and react to human students in ways that are more aligned with the humans they simulate.

The design of a compact nonlinear energy sink is introduced and the parameters of the device are examined. Simulations performed using a finite-element model of the wing coupled to discrete equations governing the energy sink indicate that targeted energy transfer is achievable, resulting, for example, in a rapid and significant reduction in the second bending mode response of the wing.

These results suggest that the effectiveness of automation in training will vary not only by the type of automation and the task, but also by the aptitude of the operator.

We first show theoretically that, in the subthreshold regime, the frequency dependence of the extracellular medium and that of the membrane potential have a clear incidence on FT. The calculation of F T from experiments and the matching with theoretical expressions is possible for desynchronized states where individual current sources can be considered as independent. Using a mean-field approximation, we obtain a method to estimate the impedance of the extracellular medium without injecting currents. We examine the transfer function for bipolar (differential) LFPs and compare to simultaneous recordings of Vmand VLFP during desynchronized states in rat barrel cortex in vivo. The experimentally derived FT matches the one derived theoretically, only if one assumes that the impedance of the extracellular medium is frequency-dependent, and varies as 1/√ω (Warburg impedance) for frequencies between 3 and 500 Hz. This constitutes indirect evidence that the extracellular medium is non-resistive, which has many possible consequences for modeling LFPs. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Computational models; EEG; Extracellular resistivity; Intracellular recordings; Local field potentials; Maxwell equations","animal experiment; article; brain cortex; cell membrane potential; compartment model; dendrite; electric capacitance; electric field; electrical potential parameters; extracellular impedance; extracellular potential; extracellular space; Fourier transformation; impedance; in vivo study; intracellular membrane; intracellular recording; local field potential; male; mathematical model; membrane capacitance; membrane electrophysiology; nonhuman; power spectrum; priority journal; rat; theoretical study; transfer; Warburg impedance; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Cell Membrane; Computer Simulation; Electric Impedance; Electroencephalography; Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Evoked Potentials; Extracellular Space; Intracellular Space; Linear Models; Male; Membrane Potentials; Models, Neurological; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Somatosensory Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651279550

The assumptions and limitations of the proposed and previous models are examined. The PENELOPE subroutines for MC simulation of radiation transport are used to model incident x-ray photon and secondary electron interactions in the photoconductor. Our simulation model takes into account applied electric field, atomic properties of the photoconductor material, carrier trapping by impurities, and bimolecular recombination between drifting carriers. The particle interaction cross-sections for photons and electrons are generated for Se over the energy range of medical imaging applications. Since inelastic collisions of secondary electrons lead to the creation of electron-hole pairs in the photoconductor, the electron inelastic collision stopping power is compared for PENELOPE's Generalized Oscillator Strength model with the established EEDL and NIST ESTAR databases. Sample simulated particle tracks for photons and electrons in Se are presented, along with the energy deposition map. The PENEASY general-purpose main program is extended with custom transport subroutines to take into account generation and transport of electron-hole pairs in an electromagnetic field. The charge transport routines consider trapping and recombination, and the energy required to create a detectable electron-hole pair can be estimated from simulations.

The formulation of the Monte Carlo code is presented in this paper, together with test results used to evaluate the range of accuracy of the model against 500ps laser-pulse propagation measurements from well-controlled and characterized particle suspensions in a 12.5m test tank.

We examined whether these adaptation effects could arise from actual sphero-cylindrical refractive errors, by testing aftereffects in images simulating second-order astigmatism. Image blur was varied from negative (vertical) through isotropic to positive (horizontal) astigmatism while maintaining constant blur strength. A 2AFC staircase was used to estimate the stimulus that appeared isotropically blurred before or after adapting to images with astigmatism. Adaptation to horizontal blur caused isotropically blurred images to appear vertically biased and vice versa, shifting the perceived isotropic point toward the adapting level. Aftereffects were similar for different types of images and showed partial selectivity so that strongest effects generally occurred when testing and adapting images were the same. Further experiments explored whether the adaptation depended more strongly on the blurring or ""fuzziness"" in the images vs. the apparent ""gural"" changes introduced by the blur, by comparing how the aftereffects transfer across changes in size or orientation. Our results suggest that strong selective adaptation can occur for different lower order aberrations of the eye and that these may be at least partly driven by the apparent gural changes that blurring introduces into the retinal image. © ARVO.","Adaptation; Adaptive optics; Astigmatism; Blur; Blur selectivity; Defocus; Gural aftereffects; Lower order aberrations; Orientation; Shape","adaptation; algorithm; article; astigmatism; eye fixation; human; methodology; orientation; pathophysiology; pattern recognition; photostimulation; physiology; theoretical model; vision; visual acuity; Adaptation, Physiological; Algorithms; Astigmatism; Figural Aftereffect; Fixation, Ocular; Form Perception; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Orientation; Photic Stimulation; Visual Acuity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78449254504

Further, this common coding is considered to allow people to recognize their own movements when presented as abstract representations, and coordinate with these movements better. We are investigating how this 'own movement effect' could be extended to improve the interaction between players and game avatars, and how it might be leveraged to augment players' cognition. To examine this question, we have designed and developed a tangible puppet interface and 3D virtual environment that are tailored to investigate the mapping between player and avatar movements. In a set of two experiments, we show that when the puppet interface is used to transfer players' movements to the avatar, the players are able to recognize their own movements, when presented alongside others' movements. In both experiments, players did not observe their movements being transferred to the avatar, and the recognition occurred after a week of the transfer. Since the recognition effect persisted even with these two handicaps, we conclude that this is a robust effect, and the puppet interface is effective in personalizing an avatar, by transferring a player's own movements to the virtual character. © 2010 ACM.","body memory; common coding; creativity; puppet; tangible user interface; video game; virtual character","body memory; common coding; creativity; puppet; Tangible user interfaces; Video game; Virtual character; Interactive computer graphics; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78249285935

For example, a quantum network can serve as a for connecting quantum processors for computation and communication, or as a simulator allowing investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels. The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and efficiently transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network. Although such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite systems, entangled states have not been achieved for interconnects capable of mapping multipartite entanglement stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here we demonstrate measurement-induced entanglement stored in four atomic memories; user-controlled, coherent transfer of the atomic entanglement to four photonic channels; and characterization of the full quadripartite entanglement using quantum uncertainty relations. Our work therefore constitutes an advance in the distribution of multipartite entanglement across quantum networks.

Methods: Forty-one medical students received rudimentary instruction in intracorporeal suturing, then were pretested on a pig enterotomy model. They then were posttested after completion of 1 of 4 training arms: laparoscopic suturing, laparoscopic drills, open suturing, and virtual reality (VR) drills. Tests were scored for speed, accuracy, knot quality, and mental workload (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] Task Load Index). Results: Paired t tests were used. Task time was improved in all groups except the VR group. Knot quality improved only in the open or laparoscopic suturing groups. Mental workload improved only for those practicing on a physical laparoscopic trainer. Conclusions: For novice trainees, the efficacy of VR training is questionable. In contrast, the other training methods had benefits in terms of time, quality, and perceived workload. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is a previously validated tool for workload self-assessment. We assessed the relationship of workload and performance during simulator training on a complex laparoscopic task. METHODS:: NASA-TLX workload data from three separate trials were analyzed. All participants were novices (n = 28), followed the same curriculum on the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery suturing model, and were tested in the animal operating room (OR) on a Nissen fundoplication model after training. Performance and workload scores were recorded at baseline, after proficiency achievement, and during the test. Performance, NASA-TLX scores, and inadvertent injuries during the test were analyzed and compared. RESULTS:: Workload scores declined during training and mirrored performance changes. NASA-TLX scores correlated significantly with performance scores (r = -0.5, P < 0.001). Participants with higher workload scores caused more inadvertent injuries to adjacent structures in the OR (r = 0.38, P < 0.05). Increased mental and physical workload scores at baseline correlated with higher workload scores in the OR (r = 0.52-0.82; P < 0.05) and more inadvertent injuries (r = 0.52, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:: Increased workload is associated with inferior task performance and higher likelihood of errors. The NASA-TLX questionnaire accurately reflects workload changes during simulator training and may identify individuals more likely to experience high workload and more prone to errors during skill transfer to the clinical environment.

It combines features of the Genome-wide Rapid Association using Mixed Model And Regression approach (GRAMMAR) with Model-Based MDR (MB-MDR). We focus on continuous traits, although the method is general and can be used for outcomes of any type, including binary and censored traits. When comparing FAM-MDR with Pedigree-based Generalized MDR (PGMDR), which is a generalization of Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) to continuous traits and related individuals, FAM-MDR was found to outperform PGMDR in terms of power, in most of the considered simulated scenarios. Additional simulations revealed that PGMDR does not appropriately deal with multiple testing and consequently gives rise to overly optimistic results. FAM-MDR adequately deals with multiple testing in epistasis screens and is in contrast rather conservative, by construction. Furthermore, simulations show that correcting for lower order (main) effects is of utmost importance when claiming epistasis. As Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a complex phenotype likely influenced by gene-gene interactions, we applied FAM-MDR to examine data on glucose area-under-the-curve (GAUC), an endophenotype of T2DM for which multiple independent genetic associations have been observed, in the Amish Family Diabetes Study (AFDS). This application reveals that FAM-MDR makes more efficient use of the available data than PGMDR and can deal with multi-generational pedigrees more easily. In conclusion, we have validated FAM-MDR and compared it to PGMDR, the current state-of-the-art MDR method for family data, using both simulations and a practical dataset. FAM-MDR is found to outperform PGMDR in that it handles the multiple testing issue more correctly, has increased power, and efficiently uses all available information.© 2010 Cattaert et al.",,"algorithm; Amish; area under the curve; article; comparative study; data analysis; epistasis; family; family multifactor dimensionality reduction; gene interaction; genetic association; genetic trait; genotype; human; individuality; model based multifactor dimensionality reduction; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear family; parent; pedigree based generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction; phenotype; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; biological model; biology; computer simulation; family health; gene regulatory network; genetic epistasis; genetics; methodology; pedigree; validation study; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Epistasis, Genetic; Family Health; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Models, Genetic; Pedigree",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954972153

This model couples macroscale partial differential equations posed over the tissue to microscale equations posed over discrete cellular geometry. The microscopic equations are used only near action potential wave fronts, and the macroscopic equations are used everywhere else. We study the effects of gap-junctional and ephaptic coupling on conduction in the multiscale model and its fully macroscale and fully microscale analogues.Our simulations reveal that the adaptive multiscalemodel accurately reproduces the action potential wave forms and wave speeds of the fully microscale model. They also demonstrate that, at low gap-junctional conductivities, the accuracy of fully macroscale simulations is sensitive to numerical grid spacing. Moreover, adaptive multiscale simulations capture the effect of ephaptic coupling, whereas fully macroscale simulations do not.We propose two ways of generalizing our multiscale model to higher dimensions, and we argue that such generalizationsmaybe necessary to obtain accurate three-dimensional simulations of cardiac conduction in certain pathophysiological parameter regimes.","Cardiac electrophysiology; Electric-field mechanism; Gap junction; Mathematical model","article; extracellular space; gap junction; heart conduction; heart muscle potential; mathematical model; multiscale model; priority journal; simulation; velocity; action potential; algorithm; animal; biological model; cell junction; computer simulation; heart muscle cell; heart muscle conduction system; human; physiology; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Computer Simulation; Gap Junctions; Heart Conduction System; Humans; Models, Cardiovascular; Myocytes, Cardiac",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957041424

However, it is difficult to obtain direct, in vivo, measurements of these quantities. The primary purpose of this study was to provide the first complete description of quadriceps geometry (force directions and moment arms) of individual quadriceps components using in vivo, 3D data collected during volitional knee extension. A secondary purpose was to determine if 3D quadriceps geometry is altered in patients with patellofemoral pain and maltracking. After obtaining informed consent, cine-phase contrast (PC) MRI sets (x,. y,. z velocity and anatomic images) were acquired from 25 asymptomatic knees and 15 knees with patellofemoral pain during active knee extension. Using a sagittal-oblique and two coronal-oblique imaging planes, the origins and insertions of each quadriceps line-of-action were identified and tracked throughout the motion by integrating the cine-PC velocity data. The force direction and relative moment (RM) were calculated for each line-of-action. All quadriceps lines-of-action were oriented primarily in the superior direction. There were no significant differences in quadriceps geometry between asymptomatic and subjects with patellofemoral pain. However, patellofemoral kinematics were significantly different between the two populations. This study will improve the ability of musculoskeletal models to closely match in vivo human performance by providing accurate 3D quadriceps geometry and associated patellofemoral kinematics during dynamic knee motion. Furthermore, determination that quadriceps geometry is not altered in patellofemoral pain supports the use of generalized a knee model based on asymptomatic quadriceps architecture. © 2010.","Force directions; Knee; Modeling; Moment arms; Patellofemoral pain; Quadriceps muscle","3D data; Human performance; Imaging plane; In-vivo; Knee; Knee extension; Knee joint; Knee models; Knee motion; Moment arms; Musculoskeletal model; Patellofemoral; Phase contrasts; Relative moments; Tissue stress; Biomechanics; Computational geometry; Health; Joints (anatomy); Kinematics; Muscle; Three dimensional; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; in vivo study; kinematics; knee function; male; muscle contraction; muscle force; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patellofemoral pain syndrome; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; Adult; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955281421

We used a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the energy-optimal waveform shape for neural stimulation. The GA was coupled to a computational model of extracellular stimulation of a mammalian myelinated axon. As the GA progressed, waveforms became increasingly energy efficient and converged upon an energy-optimal shape. The results of the GA were consistent across several trials, and resulting waveforms resembled truncated Gaussian curves. When constrained to monophasic cathodic waveforms, the GA produced waveforms that were symmetric about the peak, which occurred approximately during the middle of the pulse. However, when the cathodic waveforms were coupled to rectangular charge-balancing anodic pulses, the location and sharpness of the peak varied with the duration and timing (i.e., before or after the cathodic phase) of the anodic phase. In a model of a population of mammalian axons and in vivo experiments on a cat sciatic nerve, the GA-optimized waveforms were more energy efficient and charge efficient than several conventional waveform shapes used in neural stimulation. If used in implantable neural stimulators, GA-optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the frequency of recharge intervals, the volume of implanted pulse generators, and the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgeries. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Anodic pulse; Battery life; Computational model; Energy efficient; Extracellular stimulation; Gaussian curves; Implantable stimulators; In-vivo experiments; Myelinated axons; Neural stimulations; Neural stimulator; Optimal shape; Sciatic nerves; Wave forms; Waveform shape; Electrophysiology; Energy efficiency; Mammals; Optimization; Pulse generators; Signal generators; Genetic algorithms; article; genetic algorithm; in vivo study; nerve cell stimulation; nerve fiber; priority journal; sciatic nerve; waveform; action potential; algorithm; animal; biological model; cat; computer simulation; electrostimulation; energy transfer; male; methodology; physiology; radiation exposure; sciatic nerve; skeletal muscle; Mammalia; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Cats; Computer Simulation; Electric Stimulation; Energy Transfer; Male; Models, Genetic; Models, Neurological; Muscle, Skeletal; Sciatic Nerve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649239163

We are implementing the Robot Schemas (RS) language in Soar. RS is a CSP-type programming language for robotics that controls a hierarchy of concurrently executing schemas. The behavior of every RS schema is defined using port automata. This provides precision to the semantics and also a constructive means of reasoning about the behavior and meaning of schemas. Our implementation uses Soar operators to build, instantiate and connect port automata as needed. Our approach is to use comprehension through generation (similar to NLSoar) to search for ways to construct port automata that model perceived behaviors. The generality of RS permits us to model dynamic, concurrent behaviors. A virtual world (Ogre) is used to test the accuracy of these automata. Soar's chunking mechanism is used to generalize and save these automata. In this way, the robot learns to recognize new behaviors. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","port automata; robot schemas; Soar cognitive architecture","Cognitive architectures; Concurrent behavior; Concurrent control; Model dynamics; Programming language; Schemas; Soar cognitive architecture; Virtual worlds; Concurrency control; Information fusion; Linguistics; Mathematical operators; Rapid solidification; Robot programming; Robots; Translation (languages); Virtual reality; Automata theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954753583

At -20°C, the global average fraction of supercooled clouds in the total cloud population is found to be about 50% in the data period. Between -10 and -40°C, the fraction is smaller at lower temperatures. However, there are appreciable regional and temporal deviations from the global mean(&gt; ± 20%) at the isotherm. In the analysis with coincident dust aerosol data from the same instrument, it appears that the variation in the supercooled cloud fraction is negatively correlated with the frequencies of dust aerosols at the -20°C isotherm. This result suggests a possibility that dust particles lifted to the cold cloud layer effectively glaciate supercooled clouds. Observations of radiative flux from the clouds and earth's radiant energy system instrument aboard Terra satellite, as well as radiative transfer model simulations, show that the 20% variation in the supercooled cloud fraction is quantitatively important in cloud radiative effects, especially in shortwave, which are 10-20 W m-2 for regions of mixed-phase clouds affected by dust. In particular, our results demonstrate that dust, by glaciating supercooled water, can decrease albedo, thus compensating for the increase in albedo due to the dust aerosols themselves. This has important implications for the determination of climate sensitivity.","Aerosol-cloud interaction; Cloud radiative effect; Ice nucleation; Mixed cloud phase; Super cooled water","article; atmospheric radioactivity; climate change; cloud; environmental temperature; isotherm; polarization; priority journal; seasonal variation; aerosol; algorithm; computer simulation; dust; geography; methodology; microclimate; particle size; physics; season; statistical model; temperature; volatilization; ice; water; Aerosols; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Dust; Extraterrestrial Environment; Geography; Ice; Models, Statistical; Particle Size; Physics; Seasons; Temperature; Volatilization; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954933964

The overall dynamics of the electro-mechanical system can thus be altered by tuning the electrical parameters. A transfer-matrix-based modeling technique is adopted in the dynamic analysis, where each element is represented by two state vectors at its both ends with a transfer matrix relating them. As the transfer matrix has the advantage on describing harmonic motions within the element, the global analysis can be facilitated given the repetitive nature of periodic systems. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the characteristics of wave propagation and attenuation in terms of propagation constants. Effects of each tunable parameter are also discussed through detailed parametric analysis. The proposed system can be tailored to various engineering needs. One example is adaptive vibration isolation with tunable effective frequency range. Another example is vibration energy harvesting through the piezoelectric transducers and circuitry. © 2010 SPIE.","Circuitry dynamics; Energy harvesting; Periodic system; Piezoelectric transducer; Propagation constant; Transfer matrix; Vibration isolation","Circuitry dynamics; Periodic system; Propagation constant; Transfer matrixes; Vibration isolation; Vibration isolations; Acoustooptical effects; Computer simulation; Concrete bridges; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Dynamics; Energy harvesting; Harvesting; Integrated control; Periodic structures; Piezoelectricity; Transfer matrix method; Wave propagation; Piezoelectric transducers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953514777

Reconstruction of data, simulated to be acquired through compressed sensing is implemented on a computer generated phantom simulating two metabolites of the human brain.

On comparison of the reconstruction of the in vitro and computer generated phantoms from undersampled data to that performed from complete k-space; the errors in reconstruction was less than 1%.

It reduces dimensionality by partitioning the multi-locus genotypes into a high-risk group and a low-risk group according to whether the genotype-specific risk ratio exceeds a fixed threshold or not. Alternatively, one can maximize the χ2 value exhaustively over all possible ways of partitioning the multi-locus genotypes into two groups, and we aim to show that this is computationally feasible. Methods: We advocate finding the optimal MDR (OMDR) that would have resulted from an exhaustive search over all possible ways of partitioning the multi-locus genotypes into two groups. It is shown that this optimal MDR can be obtained efficiently using an ordered combinatorial partitioning (OCP) method, which differs from the existing MDR method in the use of a data-driven rather than fixed threshold. The generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD) theory is applied to find the optimal order of gene combination and assess statistical significance of interactions. Results: The computational complexity of OCP strategy is linear in the number of multi-locus genotypes in contrast with an exponential order for the naive exhaustive search strategy. Simulation studies show that OMDR can be more powerful than MDR with substantial power gain possible when the partitioning of OMDR is different from that of MDR. The analysis results of a breast cancer dataset show that the use of GEVD accelerates the determination of interaction order and reduces the time cost for P-value calculation by more than 10-fold. © The Author 2010.

A popular mechanism to increase the rate of convergence of these types of algorithms has been to perform the correctional updates within subsets of the projection data. This has given rise to the method of Ordered Subsets EM (OS-EM) and the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART). Commodity graphics hardware (GPUs) has shown great promise to combat the high computational demands incurred by iterative reconstruction algorithms. However, we find that the special architecture and programming model of GPUs add extra constraints on the real-time performance of ordered subsets algorithms, counteracting the speedup benefits of smaller subsets observed on CPUs. This gives rise to new relationships governing the optimal number of subsets as well as relaxation factor settings for obtaining the smallest wall-clock time for reconstruction-a factor that is likely application-dependent. In this paper we study the generalization of SIRT into Ordered Subsets SIRT and show that this allows one to optimize the computational performance of GPU-accelerated iterative algebraic reconstruction methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Commodity graphics hardware; Computed tomography; GPU; Iterative reconstruction","Algebraic reconstruction; Angular range; Computational demands; Computational performance; Computed Tomography; Expectation Maximization; Graphics hardware; Iterative reconstruction; Iterative reconstruction algorithms; Optimal number; Ordered subsets; Programming models; Projection data; Rate of convergence; Real time performance; Reconstruction algorithms; Relaxation factors; Simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique; Simultaneous iterative reconstruction techniques; Statistical noise; Algebra; Algorithms; Approximation theory; Computer graphics equipment; Computerized tomography; Convergence of numerical methods; Image reconstruction; Optimization; Program processors; Repair; Set theory; Iterative methods; algorithm; article; computer program; computer simulation; image reconstruction; information processing; mathematics; memory; performance measurement system; Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952745471

The impact of such patterns on neural coding is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The simulation of spike trains with predetermined activity patterns is therefore an important ingredient in the study of potential neural codes. Such artificially generated spike trains could also be used to manipulate cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo. Here, we propose a method to generate spike trains with given mean firing rates and cross-correlations. To capture this statistical structure we generate a point process by thresholding a stochastic process that is continuous in space and discrete in time. This stochastic process is obtained by filtering Gaussian noise through a multivariate autoregressive (AR) model. The parameters of the AR model are obtained by a nonlinear transformation of the point-process correlations to the continuous-process correlations. The proposed method is very efficient and allows for the simulation of large neural populations. It can be optimized to the structure of spatiotemporal correlations and generalized to nonstationary processes and spatiotemporal patterns of local field potentials and spike trains.

The evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) was recorded from SCN neurons located in hypothalamic brain slices. The eEPSC amplitude was stable during 0.08 Hz stimulation and exhibited frequency-dependent short-term synaptic depression (SD) during 0.5 to 100 Hz stimulus trains in 95 of 99 (96%) recorded neurons. During SD the steady-state eEPSC amplitude decreased, whereas the cumulative charge transfer increased in a frequency-dependent manner and saturated at 20 Hz. SD was similar during subjective day and night and decreased with increasing temperature. Paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) blockers were used to characterize a presynaptic release mechanism. Facilitation was present in 30% and depression in 70% of studied neurons during PPS. Synaptic transmission was reduced by blocking both N- and P/Q-type presynaptic VDCCs, but only the N-type channel blocker significantly relieved SD. Aniracetam inhibited AMPA receptor desensitization but did not alter SD. Thus we concluded that SD is the principal form of short-term plasticity at RHT synapses, which presynaptically and frequency-dependently attenuates light-induced glutamatergic RHT synaptic transmission protecting SCN neurons against excessive excitation.

Background: Cross-training is an established method in which team members are trained with the goal of building shared knowledge. Perturbation training is a new method in which team interactions are constrained to provide new coordination experiences during task acquisition. These two approaches, and a more traditional procedural approach, are compared. Method: Assigned to three training conditions were 26 teams. Teams flew nine simulated uninhabited air vehicle missions; three were critical tests of the teams ability to adapt to novel situations. Team performance, response time to novel events, and shared knowledge were measured. Results: Perturbation-trained teams significantly outperformed teams in the other conditions in two out of three critical test missions. Cross-training resulted in significant increases in shared teamwork knowledge and highest mean performance in one critical test. Procedural training led to the least adaptive teams. Conclusion: Perturbation training allows teams to match coordination variability during training to demands for coordination variability during posttraining performance. Although cross-training has adaptive benefits, it is suggested that process-oriented approaches, such as perturbation training, can lead to more adaptive teams. Application: Perturbation training is amenable to simulation-based training, where perturbations provide interaction experiences that teams can transfer to novel, real-world situations. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","adaptive teams; coordination; coordination variability; cross-training; interaction experience; novel situations; perturbation training; practice condition variability; procedural training; process-oriented training; shared knowledge; task acquisition; team cognition; team coordination; team training; Uninhabited Air Vehicle","adaptive teams; coordination; coordination variability; Cross training; Interaction experiences; novel situations; perturbation training; practice condition variability; procedural training; Process-oriented; shared knowledge; task acquisition; team cognition; Team coordination; Team training; Uninhabited air vehicles; Mergers and acquisitions; Personnel training; article; aviation; computer simulation; education; educational model; group process; human; learning; manpower; methodology; organization and management; personnel management; Aviation; Computer Simulation; Group Processes; Humans; Models, Educational; Staff Development; Transfer (Psychology)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956800026

In this study, we propose a nonlinear human bipedal model with thirteen generalized coordinates to model sit-to-stand (STS) transfer. The model has three position based holonomic constraints and at the first stage, we decouple the translational variables (constrained system) from rotational variables (unconstrained systems). The unconstrained rotational degrees consist of seven sagittal and three frontal plane angles, which are controlled through their respective joint torques. We further decouple these angles in sagittal and frontal plane systems for a better control strategy. In this scheme, there are three decoupled controllers working together to stabilize the nonlinear model for a STS maneuver while satisfying the holonomic constraints. We adopt H ∞ and H2 controller designs for feedback torques in sagittal and frontal planes, respectively, and provide simulation results to show the improvement in the angular profiles. We further adopt this modeling strategy to study and analyze the neuromuscular disorders by decoupling healthy and neurodeficient extremities. Our study indicates that the decoupling of the bipedal model improves the controllability of the system and produces better angular profiles for a bipedal STS maneuver. This modeling scheme is useful for analysis of neuromuscular disorders and other relevant physiological motor control models.

To protect public health it is necessary to quantitatively estimate the risk of long-term low dose exposure to environmental pollutants. Animal testing is the primary tool for extrapolating human risk but it is fraught with uncertainty, necessitating novel alternative approaches. Our goal is to integrate in vitro liver experiments with agent-based cellular models to simulate a spatially extended hepatic lobule. Here we describe a graphical model of the sinusoidal network that efficiently simulates portal to centrilobular mass transfer in the hepatic lobule. We analyzed the effects of vascular topology and metabolism on the cell-level distribution following oral exposure to chemicals. The spatial distribution of metabolically inactive chemicals was similar across different vascular networks and a baseline well-mixed compartment. When chemicals were rapidly metabolized, concentration heterogeneity of the parent compound increased across the vascular network. As a result, our spatially extended lobule generated greater variability in dose-dependent cellular responses, in this case apoptosis, than were observed in the classical well-mixed liver or in a parallel tubes model. The mass-balanced graphical approach to modeling the hepatic lobule is computationally efficient for simulating long-term exposure, modular for incorporating complex cellular interactions, and flexible for dealing with evolving tissues.",,"environmental chemical; apoptosis; article; computer model; concentration response; environmental exposure; in vitro study; liver cell; liver toxicity; metabolism; microdosimetry; morphology; simulation; toxicity testing; animal; biological model; biology; computer simulation; dose response; drug effect; environmental exposure; human; liver; liver vein; methodology; pathology; pollutant; tissue distribution; toxicity testing; vascularization; Animalia; Animals; Apoptosis; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Hepatic Veins; Humans; Liver; Models, Biological; Tissue Distribution; Toxicity Tests",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954612559

Some researchers have suggested that reducing performance errors with haptic guidance can benefit learning by demonstrating correct movements, while others have suggested that artificially increasing errors will force faster and more complete learning. This study compared the effect of these two techniques-haptic guidance and error amplification-as healthy subjects learned to play a computerized pinball-like game. The game required learning to press a button using wrist movement at the correct time to make a flipper hit a falling ball to a randomly positioned target. Errors were decreased or increased using a robotic device that retarded or accelerated wrist movement, based on sensed movement initiation timing errors. After training with either error amplification or haptic guidance, subjects significantly reduced their timing errors and generalized learning to untrained targets. However, for a subset of more skilled subjects, training with amplified errors produced significantly greater learning than training with the reduced errors associated with haptic guidance, while for a subset of less skilled subjects, training with haptic guidance seemed to benefit learning more. These results suggest that both techniques help enhanced performance of a timing task, but learning is optimized if training subjects with the appropriate technique based on their baseline skill level. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Error amplification; Haptic guidance; Motor learning; Timing","adaptation; adult; article; automation; controlled study; error; experimental design; female; game; human; human experiment; individuality; joint function; learning; male; motor performance; normal human; priority journal; skill; task performance; wrist; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Cross-Over Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Executive Function; Feedback, Psychological; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motor Skills; Psychomotor Performance; Robotics; Time Perception; Video Games; Wrist; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950917049

Previous theoretical and experimental studies suggest that the structure and properties of the PCM significantly influence the biomechanical environment at the microscopic scale of the chondrocytes within cartilage. In the present study, an axisymmetric boundary element method (BEM) was developed for linear elastic domains with internal interfaces. The new BEM was employed in a multiscale continuum model to determine linear elastic properties of the PCM in situ, via inverse analysis of previously reported experimental data for the three-dimensional morphological changes of chondrons within a cartilage explant in equilibrium unconfined compression (Choi, et al., 2007, ""Zonal Changes in the Three-Dimensional Morphology of the Chondron Under Compression: The Relationship Among Cellular, Pericellular, and Extracellular Deformation in Articular Cartilage,"" J. Biomech., 40, pp. 2596-2603). The microscale geometry of the chondron (cell and PCM) within the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) was represented as a three-zone equilibrated biphasic region comprised of an ellipsoidal chondrocyte with encapsulating PCM that was embedded within a spherical ECM subjected to boundary conditions for unconfined compression at its outer boundary. Accuracy of the three-zone BEM model was evaluated and compared with analytical finite element solutions. The model was then integrated with a nonlinear optimization technique (Nelder-Mead) to determine PCM elastic properties within the cartilage explant by solving an inverse problem associated with the in situ experimental data for chondron deformation. Depending on the assumed material properties of the ECM and the choice of cost function in the optimization, estimates of the PCM Young's modulus ranged from ∼24 kPa to 59 kPa, consistent with previous measurements of PCM properties on extracted chondrons using micropipette aspiration. Taken together with previous experimental and theoretical studies of cell-matrix interactions in cartilage, these findings suggest an important role for the PCM in modulating the mechanical environment of the chondrocyte.

Nonthermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is a biophysical phenomenon and an emerging novel tissue ablation modality, in which electric fields are applied in a pulsed mode to produce nanoscale defects to the cell membrane phospholipid bilayer, in such a way that Joule heating is minimized and thermal damage to other molecules in the treated volume is reduced while the cells die. Here we present a two-dimensional transient finite element model to simulate the electric field and thermal damage to the arterial wall due to an endovascular NTIRE novel device. The electric field was used to calculate the Joule heating effect, and a transient solution of the temperature is presented using the Pennes bioheat equation. This is followed by a kinetic model of the thermal damage based on the Arrhenius formulation and calculation of the Henriques and Moritz thermal damage integral. The analysis shows that the endovascular application of 90, 100 μs pulses with a potential difference of 600 V can induce electric fields of 1000 V/cm and above across the entire arterial wall, which are sufficient for irreversible electroporation. The temperature in the arterial wall reached a maximum of 66.7°C with a pulse frequency of 4 Hz. Thermal damage integral showed that this protocol will thermally damage less than 2% of the molecules around the electrodes. In conclusion, endovascular NTIRE is possible. Our study sets the theoretical basis for further preclinical and clinical trials with endovascular NTIRE.

Mathematically, the InI reconstruction is a generalization of parallel MRI (pMRI), which includes image space and k-space reconstructions. Because of the auto-calibration technique, the pMRI k-space reconstruction offers more robust and adaptive reconstructions compared to the image space algorithm. Here we present the k-space InI (K-InI) reconstructions to reconstruct the highly accelerated BOLD-contrast fMRI data of the human brain to achieve 100 ms temporal resolution. Simulations show that K-InI reconstructions can offer 3D image reconstructions at each time frame with reasonable spatial resolution, which cannot be obtained using the previously proposed image space minimum-norm estimates (MNE) or linear constraint minimum variance (LCMV) spatial filtering reconstructions. The InI reconstructions of in vivo BOLD-contrast fMRI data during a visuomotor task show that K-InI offer 3 to 5 fold more sensitive detection of the brain activation than MNE and a comparable detection sensitivity to the LCMV reconstructions. The group average of the high temporal resolution K-InI reconstructions of the hemodynamic response also shows a relative onset timing difference between the visual (first) and somatomotor (second) cortices by 400 ms (600 ms time-to-peak timing difference). This robust and sensitive K-InI reconstruction can be applied to dynamic MRI acquisitions using a large-n coil array to improve the spatiotemporal resolution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Background: Fitts law has been successfully applied to translational movements in the past, providing generalization beyond a specific task as well as performance predictions. For movements involving both translations and rotations, no equivalent theory exists, making comparisons of input devices for these movements more ambiguous. Method: The study consisted of three experiments. In the first two, participants performed either pure translational or pure rotational movements of 1 degree of freedom. The third experiment involved the same movements combined. Results: On average, the performance times for combined movements were equal to the sum of the times for equivalent separate rotational and translational movements. A simple Fitts law equivalent for combined movements with a similar slope as the separate components was proposed. In addition, a significant degree of coordination of the combined movements was found. This had a strong bias toward a parallel execution in 12 out of 13 participants. Conclusion: Combined movements with rotations and translations of 1 degree of freedom can be approximated using a simple Fitts law equivalent. The rotational and translational components appear to be coordinated by the central nervous system to generate a parallel execution. Application: The results may help drive human interface designs and provide insights into the coordination of combined movements. Future extensions may be possible for the movements of higher degrees of freedom used in robot teleoperation and virtual reality applications. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","central nervous system; combined movements; computer systems; degrees of freedom; Fitts law; human performance modeling; human-computer interaction (HCI); input devices; interface evaluation; movement coordination; performance prediction; robot teleoperation; rotational and translational movements; usability; virtual reality","central nervous system; Central nervous systems; Degrees of freedom; Human performance modeling; Input devices; Interface evaluation; Movement coordination; Performance prediction; Robot teleoperation; Experiments; Human robot interaction; Knobs; Knowledge management; Mechanics; Remote control; Rotation; Virtual reality; Human computer interaction; adolescent; adult; article; biological model; biomechanics; clinical trial; computer interface; female; human; information processing; male; movement (physiology); physiology; psychological model; psychomotor performance; reaction time; rotation; Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanics; Data Display; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Models, Psychological; Movement; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Rotation; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954189290

Input conveying eye-in-head position is needed to maintain spatial congruence because the eyes move in the head while the ears remain head-fixed. Recently, we reported that the human perception of auditory space shifts with changes in eye position. In this study, we examined whether this phenomenon is 1) dependent on a visual fixation reference, 2) selective for frequency bands (high-pass and low-pass noise) related to specific auditory spatial channels, 3) matched by a shift in the perceived straight-ahead (PSA), and 4) accompanied by a spatial shift for visual and/or bimodal (visual and auditory) targets. Subjects were tested in a dark echoattenuated chamber with their heads fixed facing a cylindrical screen, behind which a mobile speaker/LED presented targets across the frontal field. Subjects fixated alternating reference spots (0, ±20°) horizontally or vertically while either localizing targets or indicating PSA using a laser pointer. Results showed that the spatial shift induced by ocular eccentricity is 1) preserved for auditory targets without a visual fixation reference, 2) generalized for all frequency bands, and thus all auditory spatial channels, 3) paralleled by a shift in PSA, and 4) restricted to auditory space. Findings are consistent with a set-point control strategy by which eye position governs multimodal spatial alignment. The phenomenon is robust for auditory space and egocentric perception, and highlights the importance of controlling for eye position in the examination of spatial perception and behavior.

Stratifying the individual effects of each origin requires one to study the pertaining evolutionary forces across many species under diverse conditions. Here we conduct the first large-scale computational study charting the level of robustness of metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across many simulated growth environments. We provide evidence that variations among species in their level of robustness reflect ecological adaptations. We decouple metabolic robustness into two components and quantify the extents of each: the first, environmental-dependent, is responsible for at least 20% of the non-essential reactions and its extent is associated with the species' lifestyle (specialized/generalist); the second, environmental- independent, is associated (correlation = ∼0.6) with the intrinsic metabolic capacities of a species-higher robustness is observed in fast growers or in organisms with an extensive production of secondary metabolites. Finally, we identify reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug-targets. © 2010 Freilich et al.",,"article; bacterial genetics; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; biomass; controlled study; ecological genetics; environmental factor; nonhuman; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biological model; biology; computer simulation; environment; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; metabolism; methodology; systems biology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Environment; Genetic Variation; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Genetic; Selection, Genetic; Systems Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649227213

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost associated with the implementation of the FLS program into the skills curriculum of a busy general surgery residency. Methods: All general surgery residents (n = 15) followed a proficiency-based laparoscopic skills curriculum based on the FLS program. They watched the FLS CD-ROM and trained to proficiency on the five FLS tasks (peg transfer, pattern cut, ligating loop, and extracorporeal and intracorporeal knot tying). Training occurred in weekly 1-h supervised sessions. The cost associated with the implementation of the FLS program was assessed based on supplies, equipment, and personnel involvement. To decrease cost, task 3 (ligating loop) was modified to allow multiple uses of each endoloop, and sutures and Penrose drains were reused for task 4 (extracorporeal) and task 5 (intracorporeal). Results: Resident skills lab attendance averaged 51% (range = 16-84%) and totaled 211 h. Fifty-three percent (8/15) of residents achieved proficiency in at least three of the tasks (peg transfer, pattern cut, and ligating loop) after a total of 577 repetitions during the study period. The overall cost associated with the FLS program was $13,091 (personnel cost, $3,338; equipment cost, $8,567; and supplies cost $1,186). The modification of task 3 (each endoloop was used an average of 8.8 times) and the reuse of sutures and Penrose drains saved $3,446. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the cost associated with the implementation of the FLS program in a surgical residency. It demonstrates cost savings by the modification of task 3 (to allow for multiple uses of each endoloop) and tasks 4 and 5 (reuse of suture and Penrose drains) without compromising task quality.

However, no objective, reliable, and valid tool exists to assess clinical endoscopic skills. Such a tool to measure the outcomes of educational strategies is a necessity. This multicenter, multidisciplinary trial aimed to develop instruments for evaluating basic flexible endoscopic skills and to demonstrate their reliability and validity. Methods: The Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills (GAGES) Upper Endoscopy (GAGES-UE) and Colonoscopy (GAGES-C) are rating scales developed by expert endoscopists. The GAGES scale was completed by the attending endoscopist (A) and an observer (O) in self-assessment (S) during procedures to establish interrater reliability (IRR, using the intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and internal consistency (IC, using Cronbach's alpha). Instrumentation was evaluated when possible and correlated with total scores. Construct and external validity were examined by comparing novice (NOV) and experienced (EXP) endoscopists (Student's t-test). Correlations were calculated for GAGES-UE and GAGES-C with participants who had performed both. Results: For the 139 completed evaluations (60 NOV, 79 EXP), IRR (A vs. O) was 0.96 for GAGES-UE and 0.97 for GAGES-C. The IRR between S and A was 0.78 for GAGES-UE and 0.89 for GAGES-C. The IC was 0.89 for GAGES-UE, and 0.95 for GAGES-C. There were mean differences between the NOV and the EXP endoscopists for GAGE-UE (14.4 ± 3.7 vs. 18.5 ± 1.6; p < 0.001) and GAGE-C (11.8 ± 3.8 vs. 18.8 ± 1.3; p < 0.001). Good correlation was found between the scores for the GAGE-UE and the GAGE-C (r = 0.75; n = 37). Instrumentation, when performed, demonstrated correlations with total scores of 0.84 (GAGE-UE; n = 73) and 0.86 (GAGE-C; n = 45). Conclusions: The GAGES-UE and GAGES-C are easy to administer and consistent and meet high standards of reliability and validity. They can be used to measure the effectiveness of simulator training and to provide specific feedback. The GAGES results can be generalized to North American and European endoscopists and may contribute to the definition of technical proficiency in endoscopy. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Education; GI endoscopy; Technical","article; clinical competence; construct validity; controlled study; discriminant validity; endoscopy; Europe; external validity; feedback system; female; Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills Colonoscopy; Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills Upper Endoscopy; human; internal consistency; interrater reliability; male; North America; priority journal; rating scale; reliability; self evaluation; surgical training; validation process; clinical competence; clinical trial; gastrointestinal endoscopy; multicenter study; standards; Clinical Competence; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955519009

Face recognition is typically tested by having subjects compare facial images, whereas there has been virtually no attention to how they connect these images to reality. Can nonhuman primates recognize familiar individuals in photographs? Such facial identification was examined in brown or tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a New World primate, by letting subjects categorize facial images of conspecifics as either belonging to the in-group or out-group. After training on an oddity task with four images on a touch screen, subjects correctly identified one in-group member as odd among three out-group members, and vice versa. They generalized this knowledge to both new images of the same individuals and images of juveniles never presented before, thus suggesting facial identification based on real-life experience with the depicted individuals. This ability was unexplained by potential color cues because the same results were obtained with grayscale images. These tests demonstrate that capuchin monkeys, like humans, recognize whom they see in a picture.","Face recognition; Individual discrimination; Oddity; Primate; Visual discrimination","animal behavior; animal experiment; article; association; color; controlled study; face; female; group dynamics; male; monkey; nonhuman; personal experience; photography; priority journal; recognition; task performance; training; Animals; Cebus; Recognition (Psychology); Cebus; Cebus apella; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76049129459

A single person operated the lifting devices for all of the tests. Eighteen male and female volunteer participants, ranging in weight from 51 to 146 kg, acted as patients during the lifting tests. For each test, the simulated patients were pushed and pulled for 3.7 linear metres and were rotated while sitting in the lift slings. Force measurements were acquired using two single axis dynamometers affixed to the lifting devices. Results revealed that, in general, operator input force and torque increased with patient weight category and floor-based lifts required greater force and torque compared to the overhead-mounted lift. Comparison of the required forces with published force limits reveals that the required push and pull force from the various patient lift systems, across all weight categories, were generally acceptable to 90% of the female population.

This study examined the impact of incorporating two independent, spatialised tactile cues and vestibular cues into a military VE training environment with the goal of empirically examining whether such cues could enhance performance within the training environment and also that knowledge and skills gained during training could transfer to another environment. The results showed that tactile cues enhanced spatial awareness and performance during both repeated training and within a transfer environment, yet there were costs associated when two independent tactile cues were presented during training. In addition, results suggest that spatial awareness benefits from a tactile point indicator may be impacted by vestibular cues, as performance benefits were seen when tactile cues were paired with head tracking. To fully realise training potential, it is essential to determine how best to leverage multimodal capacity of VE training systems by identifying how multimodal training cues may advance knowledge, skills and attitudes of trainees.

Residents' knowledge of how to respond to rare, yet potentially life-threatening events has been shown to deteriorate over time and thus cost-effective educational interventions are indicated. Previous research has shown that test-enhanced learning has the potential to strengthen both clinical knowledge and performance. We hypothesised that critical action procedures (CAPs) tests, similar to those employed by high-performance aircraft pilots, would help improve resident knowledge about how to respond to rare and potentially catastrophic events encountered during the perioperative period. Methods: Knowledge assessments were administered to 29 first-year anaesthesiology residents over the course of 9 months. Five-minute closed-book tests were administered with fill-in-the-blank questions regarding the American Society of Anesthesiologists' difficult airway guideline, advanced cardiac life support protocols, an institutional airway fire protocol and drug dosing for malignant hyperthermia. Inter-group comparisons were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The difference between the pre-test and final test scores for each subsection was determined with the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples. Results: Composite subtest scores, when compared with baseline pre-test scores and subsequent scores, and when adjusted for attrition, significantly improved over the course of 9 months (20.5% versus 80%; P ≤ 0.001). Likert-based survey data indicated a positive report for attainment of knowledge. Conclusions: In this longitudinal observational study of first-year anaesthesiology residents, CAPs testing helped improve knowledge about critical events. Although the study was limited by its small number of subjects, a significant attrition rate and the lack of a control group, it demonstrates a cost-effective educational intervention that improved resident knowledge. This intervention may enable residents to transfer learned skills from theoretical testing situations to real-life scenarios.

However, a unified statistical procedure to combine information about position and behavior in environments with complex topological features from ensemble hippocampal activity has yet to be described. Here we present a two-stage computational framework that uses point process filters to simultaneously estimate the animal's location and predict future behavior from ensemble neural spiking activity. First, in the encoding stage, we lin- earized a two-dimensional T-maze, and used spline-based generalized linear models to characterize the place-field structure of different neurons. All of these neurons displayed highly specific position-dependent firing, which frequently had several peaks at multiple locations along the maze. When the rat was at the stem of the T-maze, the firing activity of several of these neurons also varied significantly as a function of the direction it would turn at the decision point, as detected by ANOVA. Second, in the decoding stage, we developed a state-space model for the animal's movement along a T-maze and used point process filters toaccurately reconstruct both the location of the animal and the probability of the next decision. The filter yielded exact full posterior densities that were highly nongaussian and often multimodal. Our computational framework provides a reliable approach for characterizing and extracting information from ensembles of neurons with spatially specific context or task-dependent firing activity. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"action potential; analysis of variance; animal; article; behavior; biological model; computer simulation; hippocampus; maze test; movement (physiology); nerve cell; nerve cell network; orientation; physiology; radiation exposure; rat; statistical model; Action Potentials; Analysis of Variance; Animals; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Computer Simulation; Maze Learning; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Movement; Nerve Net; Neurons; Orientation; Rats; Spatial Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72249095192

In such imaging systems, spherical aberration is deliberately introduced by the optical system lowering system modulation transfer function (MTF) and then subsequently corrected using digital processing. Previous research, however, requires complex digital postprocessing algorithms severely limiting its applicability to only expensive systems. In this paper, we examine the ability of low-cost spatially invariant finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters to restore system MTF degraded by spherical aberration. We introduce an analytical model for choosing the minimum, and hence cheapest, FIR filter size capable of providing the critical level sharpening to render artifact-free images. We identify a robust quality criterion based on the post-processed MTF for developing this model. We demonstrate the reliability of the estimated model by showing simulated spherical coded imaging results.

This work applied Fitts' law to the evaluation of performance on a target acquisition task during sensorimotor rhythm-based BCI training. Fitts' law, which has been used as a predictor of movement time in studies of human movement, was used here to determine the information transfer rate, which was based on target acquisition time and target difficulty. The information transfer rate was used to make comparisons between control modalities and subject groups on the same task. Data were analyzed from eight able-bodied and five motor disabled participants who wore an electrode cap that recorded and translated their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into computer cursor movements. Direct comparisons were made between able-bodied and disabled subjects, and between EEG and joystick cursor control in able-bodied subjects. Fitts' law aptly described the relationship between movement time and index of difficulty for each task movement direction when evaluated separately and averaged together. This study showed that Fitts' law can be successfully applied to computer cursor movement controlled by neural signals. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Brain signals; Brain-computer interface; Computer cursor; Computer screens; Cursor control; Disabled individuals; Electrode cap; Electroencephalogram signals; Fitts' law; Human movements; Information transfer rate; Neural signals; Target acquisition; Communication systems; Computer control systems; Electroencephalography; Fluorine containing polymers; Mergers and acquisitions; Motors; Optical sensors; Targets; Interfaces (computer); adult; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; article; brain computer interface; cerebral palsy; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; data analysis; disease duration; electroencephalogram; ergonomics; evaluation; experimental design; female; fitt law; human; information; locked in syndrome; male; motion; motor dysfunction; muscular dystrophy; postpoliomyelitis syndrome; priority journal; screening; sensorimotor function; signal processing; spinal cord injury; spinal muscular atrophy; task performance; aged; algorithm; brain; electroencephalography; methodology; middle aged; motor dysfunction; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Brain; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Movement Disorders; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449724673

Levy Place, New York, NY 10029, United States","Many physiological responses elicited by neuronal spikes-intracellular calcium transients, synaptic potentials, muscle contractions-are built up of discrete, elementary responses to each spike. However, the spikes occur in trains of arbitrary temporal complexity, and each elementary response not only sums with previous ones, but can itself be modified by the previous history of the activity. A basic goal in system identification is to characterize the spike-response transform in terms of a small number of functions-the elementary response kernel and additional kernels or functions that describe the dependence on previous history-that will predict the response to any arbitrary spike train. Here we do this by developing further and generalizing the ""synaptic decoding"" approach of Sen et al. (1996). Given the spike times in a train and the observed overall response, we use least-squares minimization to construct the best estimated response and at the same time best estimates of the elementary response kernel and the other functions that characterize the spike-response transform. We avoid the need for any specific initial assumptions about these functions by using techniques of mathematical analysis and linear algebra that allow us to solve simultaneously for all of the numerical function values treated as independent parameters. The functions are such that they may be interpreted mechanistically. We examine the performance of the method as applied to synthetic data. We then use the method to decode real synaptic and muscle contraction transforms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The movement was performed with the nondominant arm in similarity with the baseball bat swing. The task was to generate maximum hand velocity at a target. The movement included trunk long-axis rotation and horizontal shoulder and elbow extension. Kinematics and torque analyses were performed to study the organization of fastest movements and to compare trials representing the best and worst performance in each subject. Results revealed complex control strategy, with the trunk, shoulder, and elbow playing unique roles in generation of maximal hand velocity. The trunk provided a crucial contribution, directly, rotating the entire arm, and indirectly, exerting interaction torque that caused swift elbow extension. The major role of the shoulder was to transfer the mechanical effect of trunk motion to the elbow. However, the shoulder became the primary motion generator when the trunk reached its limits of rotation, revealing sequential organization of control. The role of the elbow was to maximally comply with passive influence of proximal joints. The findings are discussed in light of the leading joint hypothesis that offers a straightforward interpretation of control of horizontal arm swing as well as practically efficient recommendations for increases in movement speed. The revealed role of intersegmental dynamics in production of high movement speed suggests that movement slowness characteristic for some motor disorders may be partially a compensatory strategy that facilitates regulation of interaction torque.

We reduced to practice the concept by building a prototype generator and stimulator. We demonstrated its feasibility in vivo, using rabbit quadriceps to drive the generator. The generated power was sufficient for self-sustaining operation of the stimulator and additional harnessed power was dissipated through a load resistor. The prototype generator was developed and the power generating capabilities were tested with a mechanical muscle analog. In vivo generated power matched the mechanical muscle analog, verifying its usefulness as a test-bed for generator development. Generator output power was dependent on the muscle stimulation parameters. Simulations and in vivo testing demonstrated that for a fixed number of stimuli/minute, two stimuli applied at a high frequency generated greater power than single stimuli or tetanic contractions. Larger muscles and circuitry improvements are expected to increase available power.

Here, we investigated the effect of canal plugging in two macaque monkeys on the horizontal vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the responses of vestibular-nerve afferents during passive head rotations. Afferent responses to active head movements were also studied. The horizontal VOR gain decreased after plugging to <0.1 for frequencies <2 Hz but rose to about 0.6 as frequency was increased to 15 Hz. Afferents innervating plugged horizontal canals had response sensitivities that increased with the frequency of passive rotations from <0.01 (spikes/s)/(°/s) at 0.5 Hz to values of about 0.2 and 0.5 (spikes/s)/(°/s) at 8 Hz for regular and irregular afferents, respectively (<50% of responses in controls). An increase in phase lead was also noted following plugging in afferent discharge, but not in the VOR. Because the phase discrepancy between the VOR and afferent discharge is much larger than that seen in control animals, this suggests that central adaptation shapes VOR dynamics following plugging. The effect of canal plugging on afferent responses can be modeled as an increase in stiffness and a reduction in the dominant time constant and gain in the transfer function describing canal dynamics. Responses were also evident during active head rotations, consistent with the frequency content of these movements. We conclude that canal plugging in macaques is effective only at frequencies <2 Hz. At higher frequencies, afferents show significant responses, with a nearly 90° phase lead, such that they encode near-rotational acceleration. Our results demonstrate that afferents innervating plugged canals respond robustly during voluntary movements, a finding that has implications for understanding the effects of canal plugging in clinical practice.

Thus, students learn more if they have a say in deciding what specific topics and examples are being discussed in class. Naturally, the instructor knows what topics are important to cover in a course and which ones might be optional. Finding the right balance between students' preferences and the instructor's requirements is not so easy and thus may prevent this kind of shared control of the classroom from being realized. This article describes how the instructor's and students' interests can be used to generate a list of course topics that satisfies both parties. However, instead of adding technology to the classroom, technology is used to improve the classroom experiences. Specifically, it is shown how course topics can be assigned to specific students maximizing what is meaningful to the students and satisfies the course parameters as defined by the instructor. This problem can be formulated as a variation of the linear assignment problem and solved with a binary linear program. Results from actual and simulated courses are discussed and generalizations of the topic assignment problem presented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A survey of 90 papers found that 92% of group fMRI analyses used OLS. Despite the widespread use, this simple approach has never been thoroughly justified and evaluated; for example, the typical reference for the method is a conference abstract, (Holmes, A., Friston, K., 1998. Generalisability, random effects & population inference. NeuroImage 7 (4 (2/3)), S754, proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 7-12, 1998, Montreal, Canada.), which has been referenced over 400 times. In this work we fully derive the simplified method in a general setting and carefully identify the homogeneity assumptions it is based on. We examine the specificity (Type I error rate) of the OLS method under heterogeneity in the one-sample case and find that the OLS method is valid, with only slight conservativeness. Surprisingly, a Satterthwaite approximation for effective degrees of freedom only makes the method more conservative, instead of more accurate. While other authors have highlighted the inferior power of the OLS method relative to optimal mixed-effects methods under heterogeneity, we revisit these results and find the power differences very modest. While statistical methods that make the best use of the data are always to be preferred, software or other practical concerns may require the use of the simple OLS group modeling.

However, all studies of negative correlations between the default-mode and task-positive networks have employed some form of normalization or regression of the whole-brain average signal (""global signal""); these processing steps alter the time series of voxels in an uninterpretable manner as well as introduce spurious negative correlations. Thus, the extent of negative correlations with the default mode network without global signal removal has not been well characterized, and it is has recently been hypothesized that the apparent negative correlations in many of the task-positive regions could be artifactually induced by global signal pre-processing. The present study aimed to examine negative and positive correlations with the default-mode network when model-based corrections for respiratory and cardiac noise are applied in lieu of global signal removal. Physiological noise correction consisted of (1) removal of time-locked cardiac and respiratory artifacts using RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn. Reson. Med. 44, 162-167), and (2) removal of low-frequency respiratory and heart rate variations by convolving these waveforms with pre-determined transfer functions (Birn et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2009) and projecting the resulting two signals out of the data. It is demonstrated that negative correlations between the default-mode network and regions of the task-positive network are present in the majority of individual subjects both with and without physiological noise correction. Physiological noise correction increased the spatial extent and magnitude of negative correlations, yielding negative correlations within task-positive regions at the group-level (p < 0.05, uncorrected; no regions at the group level were significant at FDR = 0.05). Furthermore, physiological noise correction caused region-specific decreases in positive correlations within the default-mode network, reducing apparent false positives. It was observed that the low-frequency respiratory volume and cardiac rate regressors used within the physiological noise correction algorithm displayed significant (but not total) shared variance with the global signal, and constitute a model-based alternative to correcting for non-neural global noise. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Twelve healthy young (age, 19-31 yr) and 12 healthy elderly (age, 60-82 yr) women performed bilateral and unilateral knee-hip extension movements on the dynamometer against loads controlled by the servo system. Under the isotonic force condition, force-velocity relationships were measured. The maximum isometric force (Fmax), unloaded velocity (Vmax) and power output (Pmax) of the movements were calculated from extrapolating force-velocity and force-power relationships. Fmax and Pmax of bilateral and unilateral knee-hip extension movements were 20-30% lower in elderly than in young women. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in Vmax between young and elderly women and between bilateral and unilateral movements. Bilateral deficit was larger as the generation of force was larger in both young and elderly women. Also, bilateral deficit of Fmax and Pmax were not different between young and elderly women. The results were that lower maximum power output of bilateral and unilateral leg multi-joint movements in elderly women did not depend on the intrinsic shortening velocity of muscle action, but largely on reduction in force generating capacity. This suggests the importance of preventing a loss of force generating capacity of muscles during leg multi-joint movements in elderly women. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The shutter-speed pharmacokinetic effects of both transendothelial and transcytolemmal equilibrium water exchange processes were investigated. Our results indicate that even for such a short acquisition window and relatively large pseudo-first-order rate constant (Ktrans) for plasma/interstitium contrast reagent (CR) transfer the kinetics of these water exchange processes cannot be treated as infinitely fast or slow. However, neither the intracellular water molecule lifetime (τ i) nor its intravascular counterpart (τ b) are among the parameters most influential in analysis of the noisy data typically associated with the cardiac perfusion application. Thus, the actual values of water exchange kinetic rate constants are relatively indeterminate as this experiment is usually conducted. Combining the Ktrans evaluations with independently determined flow (F) values allows us to estimate CR permeability coefficient surface area product (PCRS) values. The fact that the PCRS magnitudes almost equal the Ktrans values confirms that GdDTPA2- extravasation in resting human myocardial muscle is indeed permeation-limited and supports the validity of the Ktrans and PCRS estimations. Nevertheless the model analysis is most consistent with the results if PCRS is not assumed to be constant with changing flow. The capillary blood volume fraction (vb) is a sensitive parameter in the analysis. We also compared resting and hyperemic cardiac conditions, the latter resulting from the volume flow increase induced by adenosine arteriolar vasodilation. We found that the PCRS value increases with flow probably mostly because of an S increase associated with capillary recruitment. The vb values also increased in hyperemia and showed a flow-dependence with a clearly identifiable component due to capillary recruitment.

Flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer (FDL) is currently the gold standard for the correction of this problem. Transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) has been recently proposed as an alternative method to treat such deformity. The aim of this work is to compare the biomechanical outcome of these two methods by means of finite-element simulation. The results show that the reduction in the dorsal displacement of the proximal phalanx (PP) for the second and third toes were very similar (about 4.3 mm for each intervention), both achieving a significant reduction in MPJ dorsiflexion when compared to no intervention (displacements are reduced by approximately 51%). In the fourth and fifth toes, only a small correction in the deformity was achieved with both the techniques (10% and 7%, respectively). FDB and FDL tendon transfer reduced the stress level when compared with the non-operated pathologic foot (the reduction of stresses for the second and third PP ranged between 20% and 40%). FDB transfer resulted in a more uniform distribution of stress along the entire toe, although differences were small in all cases. These results confirm that both the tendon-transfer techniques are effective in the treatment of claw toe deformity. Therefore, the choice of technique is at the discretion of the surgeon. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability to quantify the strength with which two binding partners interact is desirable but the accurate determination of equilibrium binding constants is a difficult process. The use of Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) provides a homogeneous binding assay that can be used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Previously, we developed an LRET assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of σ70 with theβ' coiled-coil fragment (amino acids 100-309). Here we describe an LRET binding assay used to monitor the interaction of E. coli σ70 and σ32 with core RNA polymerase along with the controls to verify the system. This approach generates fluorescently labeled proteins through the random labeling of lysine residues which enables the use of the LRET assay for proteins for which the creation of single cysteine mutants is not feasible. With the LRET binding assay, we are able to show that the interaction of σ70 with core RNAP is much more sensitive to NaCl than to potassium glutamate (KGlu), whereas the σ32 interaction with core RNAP is insensitive to both salts even at concentrations >500 mM. We also find that the interaction of σ32 with core RNAP is stronger than σ70 with core RNAP, under all conditions tested. This work establishes a consistent set of conditions for the comparison of the binding affinities of the E.coli sigma factors with core RNA polymerase. The examination of the importance of salt conditions in the binding of these proteins could have implications in both in vitro assay conditions and in vivo function. © 2009 Glaser et al.",,"cysteine; glutamic acid; lysine; mutant protein; RNA polymerase; sigma factor; sigma factor RpoD; sigma factor RpoH; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; DNA directed RNA polymerase; fluorescent dye; glutamic acid derivative; heat shock protein; heat shock sigma factor 32; heat-shock sigma factor 32; RNA polymerase sigma 70; sigma factor; sodium chloride; article; binding affinity; binding assay; chemical labeling; controlled study; Escherichia coli; fluorescence; luminescence resonance energy transfer; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein protein interaction; protein RNA binding; chemistry; energy transfer; luminescence; metabolism; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein binding; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; Glutamates; Heat-Shock Proteins; Luminescence; Protein Binding; Sigma Factor; Sodium Chloride; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149122340

This analysis ultimately results in the production of z-statistic images corresponding to the contrasts of interest. Thresholding such z-statistic images at uncorrected thresholds suitable for testing activation at a single voxel results in the problem of multiple comparisons. A number of methods which account for the problem of multiple comparisons have been proposed including Gaussian random field theory, mixture modeling and false discovery rate (FDR). The focus of this paper is on the development of a generalized version of FDR (GFDR) in an empirical Bayesian framework, specially adapted for fMRI thresholding, that is more robust to modeling violations as compared to traditional FDR. We show theoretically as well as by simulation that for real fMRI data various factors lead to a mixture of Gaussians (MOG) density for the ""null"" distribution. Artificial data was used to systematically study the bias of FDR and GFDR under varying intensity of modeling violations, signal to noise ratios and activation fractions for a range of q values. GFDR was able to handle modeling violations and produce good results when FDR failed. Real fMRI data was also used to confirm GFDR capabilities. Our results indicate that it is very important to account for the form and fraction of the ""null"" hypothesis adaptively from the data in order to obtain valid inference. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

One, the model satisfied conservation of energy. Two, the heat transfer rate from blood vessels to tissue was modeled without following a vessel path. Three, the model applied to any unheated and heated tissue. To meet these criteria, a generic bioheat transfer model (BHTM) was derived here by conserving thermal energy in a heated vascularized finite tissue and by making a few simplifying assumptions. Two linear coupled differential equations were obtained with the following two variables: tissue volume averaged temperature and blood volume averaged temperature. The generic model was compared with the widely employed empirical Pennes' BHTM. The comparison showed that the Pennes' perfusion term wC p(1 - ε) should be interpreted as a local vasculature dependent heat transfer coefficient term. Suggestions are presented for further adaptations of the general BHTM for specific tissues using imaging techniques and numerical simulations.

The native structures and functions of those proteins can often be inferred using bioinformatics methods. We show here that it is also possible to infer the stabilities and thermal folding properties of proteins, given only simple genomics information: the chain length and the numbers of charged side chains. In particular, our model predicts ΔH(T), ΔS(T), ΔCp, and ΔF(T) - the folding enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and free energy - as functions of temperature T; the denaturant mvalues in guanidine and urea; the pH-temperature-salt phase diagrams, and the energy of confinement F(s) of the protein inside a cavity of radius s. All combinations of these phase equilibria can also then be computed from that information.

The world is fraught with stifling inequalities, both from an economic as well as socio-political perspective. The net result has been large capability gaps between various organizational locations that need to work together, which has raised new challenges for information security teams. Similar issues arise, when mergers and acquisitions among and between organizations take place. While integrating remote business locations with mainstream operations, one or more of the issues including the lack of application level support, computational capabilities, communication limitations, and legal requirements cause a serious impediment thereby complicating integration while not violating the organizations' security requirements. Often resorted techniques like IPSec, tunneling, secure socket layer, etc. may not be always techno-economically feasible. This paper addresses such security issues by introducing an intermediate server between corporate central server and remote sites, called stand-off-server. We present techniques such as break-before-make connection, break connection after transfer, multiple virtual machine instances with different operating systems using the concept of a stand-off-server. Our experiments show that the proposed solution provides sufficient isolation for the central server/site from attacks arising out of weak communication and/or computing links and is simple to implement. © 2009 SPIE.","Communication System Security; Computer Network Security; Data Security; Security; Simulation","Application level; Central servers; Communication System Security; Computational capability; Data Security; Global reach; Information security; Legal requirements; Operating systems; Political perspective; Remote sites; Secure data; Secure socket layers; Security; Security issues; Security requirements; Server architecture; Service provider; Simulation; Stand-off; Tunneling ,; Virtual machines; Communication systems; Computer operating systems; Heterogeneous networks; Information management; Integration; Internet; Intrusion detection; Mergers and acquisitions; Mining; Sailing vessels; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66749130371

The context of our work is the origin of divisive versus subtractive gain control, as mixtures of these effects are seen in a variety of experimental systems. We focus on changes in the slope of the mean firing frequency-versus-input bias (f -I) curve when the gain control signal to the cells comes from the cells' output spikes. Feedback spikes are modeled as alpha functions that produce an additive current in the current balance equation. For generality, they occur after a fixed minimum delay. We show that purely divisive gain control, i.e. changes in the slope of the f -I curve, arises naturally with this additive negative or positive feedback, due to a linearizing actions of feedback. Negative feedback alone lowers the gain, accounting in particular for gain changes in weakly electric fish upon pharmacological opening of the feedback loop as reported by Bastian (J Neurosci 6:553-562, 1986). When negative feedback is sufficiently strong it further causes oscillatory firing patterns which produce irregularities in the f -I curve. Small positive feedback alone increases the gain, but larger amounts cause abrupt jumps to higher firing frequencies. On the other hand, noise alone in open loop linearizes the f -I curve around threshold, and produces mixtures of divisive and subtractive gain control. With both noise and feedback, the combined gain control schemes produce a primarily divisive gain control shift, indicating the robustness of feedback gain control in stochastic networks. Similar results are found when the ""input"" parameter is the contrast of a time-varying signal rather than the bias current. Theoretical results are derived relating the slope of the f -I curve to feedback gain and noise strength. Good agreement with simulation results are found for inhibitory and excitatory feedback. Finally, divisive feedback is also found for conductance-based feedback (shunting or excitatory) with and without noise. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Delays; Electric fish; Feedback; Gain control; Leaky integrate-and-fire; Noise; Spiking networks","Delays; Electric fish; Leaky integrate-and-fire; Noise; Spiking networks; Gain control; Meats; Feedback; action potential; animal; article; biological model; electric fish; feedback system; nerve cell; nerve cell network; physiology; statistics; Action Potentials; Animals; Electric Fish; Feedback; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650466932

Parameter values can be estimated from steady-state data or from dynamic data. The nature of suitable data for these two types of estimation is rather different. For instance, estimations of parameter values in pathway models, such as kinetic orders, rate constants, flux control coefficients or elasticities, from steady-state data are generally based on experiments that measure how a biochemical system responds to small perturbations around the steady state. In contrast, parameter estimation from dynamic data requires time series measurements for all dependent variables. Almost no literature has so far discussed the combined use of both steady-state and transient data for estimating parameter values of biochemical systems. Results: In this study we introduce a constrained optimization method for estimating parameter values of biochemical pathway models using steady-state information and transient measurements. The constraints are derived from the flux connectivity relationships of the system at the steady state. Two case studies demonstrate the estimation results with and without flux connectivity constraints. The unconstrained optimal estimates from dynamic data may fit the experiments well, but they do not necessarily maintain the connectivity relationships. As a consequence, individual fluxes may be misrepresented, which may cause problems in later extrapolations. By contrast, the constrained estimation accounting for flux connectivity information reduces this misrepresentation and thereby yields improved model parameters. Conclusion: The method combines transient metabolic profiles and steady-state information and leads to the formulation of an inverse parameter estimation task as a constrained optimization problem. Parameter estimation and model selection are simultaneously carried out on the constrained optimization problem and yield realistic model parameters that are more likely to hold up in extrapolations with the model. © 2009 Ko et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Connectivity constraints; Connectivity information; Constrained estimation; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Constrained optimization methods; Flux control coefficients; Quantitative measurement; Transient measurement; Biochemistry; Biological systems; Constrained optimization; Elasticity; Estimation; Experiments; Extrapolation; Mathematical models; Rate constants; Parameter estimation; article; bacterial metabolism; bioinformatics; case study; controlled study; Escherichia coli; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; nonhuman; process optimization; algorithm; biochemistry; biological model; computer simulation; factual database; feedback system; metabolism; physiology; reproducibility; statistical model; aspartic acid; Escherichia coli protein; threonine; Algorithms; Aspartic Acid; Biochemical Processes; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Feedback, Biochemical; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results; Threonine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650911355

One class of useful models that can be fit easily to spiking data is based on generalized linear point process models from statistics. Once the parameters for these models are fit, the analyst is left with a nonlinear spiking network model with delays, which in general may be very difficult to understand analytically. Here we develop mean-field methods for approximating the stimulus-driven firing rates (in both the time-varying and steady-state cases), auto- and cross-correlations, and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of these networks. These approximations are valid when the contributions of individual network coupling terms are small and, hence, the total input to a neuron is approximately gaussian. These approximations lead to deterministic ordinary differential equations that are much easier to solve and analyze than direct Monte Carlo simulation of the network activity. These approximations also provide an analytical way to evaluate the linear input-output filter of neurons and how the filters aremodulated by network interactions and some stimulus feature. Finally, in the case of strong refractory effects, the mean-field approximations in the generalized linear model become inaccurate; therefore, we introduce a model that captures strong refractoriness, retains all of the easy fitting properties of the standard generalized linear model, and leads to much more accurate approximations of mean firing rates and cross-correlations that retain fine temporal behaviors. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"action potential; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; nerve cell; nerve cell network; physiology; probability; statistical model; time; Action Potentials; Animals; Computer Simulation; Linear Models; Markov Chains; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349239144

This problem has been particularly challenging because biological systems typically contain large numbers of interacting elements, which precludes the use of standard brute force approaches. Recently, though, several groups have reported that there may be an alternate strategy. The reports show that reliable statistical models can be built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead, pairwise interactions can suffice. These findings, however, are based on the analysis of small subsystems. Here, we ask whether the observations will generalize to systems of realistic size, that is, whether pairwise models will provide reliable descriptions of true biological systems. Our results show that, in most cases, they will not. The reason is that there is a crossover in the predictive power of pairwise models: If the size of the subsystem is below the crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large systems. If the size is above the crossover point, then the results may have predictive power. This work thus provides a general framework for determining the extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of large biological systems. Applied to neural data, the size of most systems studied so far is below the crossover point. © 2009 Roudi et al.",,"article; correlation coefficient; entropy; mathematical analysis; protein folding; spike wave; algorithm; biological model; computer simulation; entropy; methodology; statistical model; systems biology; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Entropy; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Systems Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67049119347

The usefulness of this representation goes beyond the convenience of a scale independent representation. It provides a variable memory length representation of transition. This includes the representation of succession with non-integer order, which comes with the promise of generalizing Markovian formalisms. The original proposal targeted genomic sequences only but since then several generalizations have been proposed, many specifically designed to handle protein data. Results: The challenge ofa general solution is that of deriving a bijective transformation of symbolic sequences into bi-dimensional planes. More specifically, it requires the regular fractal nesting of polygons. A first attempt at a general solution was proposed by Fiser 1994 by using non-overlapping circles that contain the polygons. This was used as a starting point to identify a more efficient solution where the encapsulating circles can overlap without the same happening for the sequence maps which are circumscribed to fractal polygon domains. Conclusion: We identified the optimal inscribed packing solution for iterated maps of any Biological sequence, indeed of any symbolic sequence. The new solution maintains the prized bijective mapping property and includes the Sierpinski triangle and the CGR square as particular solutions of the more encompassing formulation. © 2009 Almeida and Vinga; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Bijective mapping; Biological sequences; Chaos game representation; General solutions; Particular solution; Sierpinski triangle; Symbolic sequence; Two-dimensional solutions; Fractals; article; computer graphics; computer interface; computer simulation; DNA sequence; gene sequence; genetic algorithm; Internet; nucleotide sequence; sequence analysis; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; biology; computer program; methodology; sequence analysis; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Sequence Analysis; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549110447

At the higher level of the hierarchy, the total force and moment of force produced on an object are distributed between the thumb and the virtual finger (an imagined finger with mechanical output equal to the involved fingers of the hand), while at the lower level the virtual finger action is distributed among the four fingers. We tested a hypothesis that the CNS is able to organize synergies at only one level of the hierarchy. The subjects held vertically one of the two handles, a narrow one and a wide one. They used the four fingers of the right hand opposed by the right hand thumb, the left hand thumb, the left hand index finger, the thumb of an experimenter, the index finger of an experimenter, or an inanimate object. Forces and moments of force produced by each digit were recorded. Indices of synergies stabilizing the mechanical output variables at each of the two levels were computed. Contrary to the expectations, force and moment of force stabilizing synergies were found at one or both levels of the hierarchy across all tasks. Unimanual tasks exhibited higher synergy indices compared to all tasks, while intrapersonal synergy indices were higher than those of interpersonal synergies. The results suggest that both feed-forward and feedback mechanisms may be used to create force and moment of force stabilizing synergies. We invoke the notion of chain effects and generalize it for relations among variance components related to stabilization of different mechanical variables. The reference configuration hypothesis offers a fruitful framework for analysis of prehension synergies. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Bimanual actions; Hand; Hierarchical control; Prehension; Synergy","article; central nervous system; comprehension; female; finger; force; human; human experiment; index finger; male; mental function; motor control; normal human; priority journal; simulation; task performance; thumb; Algorithms; Analysis of Variance; Central Nervous System; Female; Fingers; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Motor Activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62149105552

However, application of adaptive methods to neurophysiology has been limited by severe computational challenges. Since most neurons are high-dimensional systems, optimizing neurophysiology experiments requires computing high-dimensional integrations and optimizations in real time. Here we present a fast algorithm for choosing the most informative stimulus by maximizing the mutual information between the data and the unknown parameters of a generalized linear model (GLM)that wewant to fit to the neuron's activity. We rely on important log concavity and asymptotic normality properties of the posterior to facilitate the required computations. Our algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a two-dimensional search to choose the optimal stimulus. The average running time of these operations scales quadratically with the dimensionality of the GLM, making realtime adaptive experimental design feasible even for high-dimensional stimulus and parameter spaces. For example, we require roughly 10 milliseconds on a desktop computer to optimize a 100-dimensional stimulus. Despite using some approximations to make the algorithm efficient, our algorithm asymptotically decreases the uncertainty about the model parameters at a rate equal to the maximum rate predicted by an asymptotic analysis. Simulation results show that picking stimuli by maximizing the mutual information can speed up convergence to the optimal values of the parameters by an order of magnitude compared to using random (nonadaptive) stimuli. Finally, applying our design procedure to real neurophysiology experiments requires addressing the nonstationarities that we would expect to see in neural responses; our algorithm can efficiently handle both fast adaptation due to spike history effects and slow, nonsystematic drifts in a neuron's activity. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"algorithm; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; human; methodology; nerve cell; neurophysiology; nonlinear system; physiology; time; Algorithms; Animals; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Neurophysiology; Nonlinear Dynamics; Research Design; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63249126388

For, in order to understand how a cell distinguishes between input patterns we apparently need a model that is biophysically accurate down to the space scale of a single spine, i.e., 1 μm. We argue here that one can retain this highly detailed input structure while dramatically reducing the overall system dimension if one is content to accurately reproduce the associated membrane potential at a small number of places, e.g., at the site of action potential initiation, under subthreshold stimulation. The latter hypothesis permits us to approximate the active cell model with an associated quasi-active model, which in turn we reduce by both time-domain (Balanced Truncation) and frequency-domain (H2 approximation of the transfer function) methods. We apply and contrast these methods on a suite of typical cells, achieving up to four orders of magnitude in dimension reduction and an associated speed-up in the simulation of dendritic democratization and resonance. We also append a threshold mechanism and indicate that this reduction has the potential to deliver an accurate quasi-integrate and fire model. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Balanced truncation; Compartmental models; Dendritic democratization; Dendritic resonance; Integrate-and-fire; Krylov methods; Quasi-active","accuracy; article; cell compartmentalization; cell kinetics; cell structure; cell transfer; compartment model; dendrite; hippocampus; nerve cell membrane conductance; nerve cell membrane potential; nerve cell stimulation; nonhuman; priority journal; stimulus response; synaptic potential; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Axons; Cell Membrane; Central Nervous System; Computer Simulation; Dendrites; Humans; Ion Channels; Kinetics; Linear Models; Membrane Potentials; Neural Pathways; Neurons; Rats; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549097807

Theoretical studies have indicated that the high conductance state of neurons brought on by synaptic activity can contribute to an increase in the variability of spike output by decreasing the integration timescale of the neuron. In the present work, we were interested in understanding how background synaptic conductance activity alters the interspike interval (ISI) variability of layer III pyramidal cells of the medial entorhinal cortex. We compared ISI variability in pyramidal cells as a result of synaptic current- or conductance-mediated membrane fluctuations. We found that the effects of background synaptic conductance activity on ISI variability depend on the neuron type. In pyramidal cells lacking spike frequency adaptation, the variability increased in relation to a comparable synaptic current stimulus. In contrast, in pyramidal cells displaying spike frequency adaptation, the synaptic conductance stimulus produced lower ISI variability. To understand this result, we constructed a phenomenological model that reproduced the basic properties of these neurons under control and increased leak conductance. We found that leak can change the properties of the neuron by acting as a bifurcation parameter that reduces the afterdepolarization (ADP) and decreases the slope (gain) of the frequency- current relationship, particularly for transient stimuli. A lower gain with the added leak causes a reduction in ISI variability. We conclude that the ability of a high conductance state to increase ISI variability cannot be generalized and can depend on the spike ADP dynamics expressed by the neuron.

Twenty-two healthy right-dominant subjects were divided into two groups: half performed the tasks first using the right foot (group RL), and the other half performed it first with the left foot (group LR). Targets appeared on a computer screen at head-height while subjects were seated with one foot on a goniometric ankle platform. Subjects were required to move the cursor toward one of three randomly appearing targets under two conditions: (1) neutral or no visual motor rotation, and (2) with a 30° visuo-motor rotation. Performance was quantified by computing the z-score for direction and position errors for each subject and ILT was assessed by comparing group performances for each foot. Results demonstrated that group LR but not group RL experienced significant ILT of directional as well as positional information in both tasks in a manner reflective of the distinctly different functional roles played by the upper and lower limbs. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Ankle; Cross hemispheric transfer; Inter-limb transfer; Limb dominance; Lower limb; Motor learning; Visuomotor rotation","adult; ankle; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; inter limb learning transfer; joint function; leg movement; male; motor performance; normal human; priority journal; visuomotor coordination; Adult; Ankle; Arm; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Kinesthesis; Learning; Leg; Male; Motor Skills; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Neural Pathways; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Proprioception; Psychomotor Performance; Rehabilitation; Teaching; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849122620

However, it is not clearly understood how the comparison of perceptual information associated with passive limb displacement and the corresponding matching movement resulting from the execution of a motor command contributes to these differences. In the present study, upper limb position sense was investigated in 12 right-hand-dominant young adults performing wrist position matching tasks which varied in terms of interhemispheric transfer, memory retrieval and whether the reference position was provided by the same or opposite limb. Right and left hand absolute matching errors were similar when the reference and matching positions were produced by the same hand but were 36% greater when matching the reference position with the opposite hand. When examining the constant errors generated from matching movements made with the same hand that provided the reference, the right and left hand matching errors (≈3°) were similar. However, when matching with the opposite limb, a large overshoot (P < 0.05) characterized the error when the right hand matched the left hand reference while a large undershoot (P < 0.05) characterized the error when the left hand matched the right hand reference. The overshoot and undershoot were of similar magnitude (≈4°). Although asymmetries in the central processing of proprioceptive information such as interhemispheric transfer may exist, the present study suggests that asymmetries in position sense predominantly result from a difference in the ""gain of the respective proprioceptive sensory-motor loops"".

A new generation of laparoscopic instruments with the ability to articulate their end effectors is available. Although these instruments offer the flexibility needed to perform complex tasks in a constricted surgical site, their control may be hampered by their increased complexity. Methods: This study compared the task performance between articulating and conventional laparoscopic instruments. Surgeons with extensive laparoscopic experience (8 experts) and staff with no surgical experience (8 novices) were recruited for the test. Both groups were required to perform three standardized tasks (peg transfer, left-to-right suturing, and up-and-down suturing) in a bench top model using conventional and articulating instruments. Performance was scored using a standardized 100-point scale based on movement speed and accuracy. After the initial trials with conventional and articulating instruments, each participant was given a short orientation on how to use the articulating instrument advantageously. The participant then was retested with the articulating instrument. Results: As expected, the expert group scored significantly better than the novice group (p < 0.001). The combined data from both groups showed better performance with the conventional instruments than with the articulating instruments (p = 0.074). The experts maintained their proficient laparoscopic performance using conventional instruments in their first attempts with the articulating instruments (91 vs. 84), whereas the novices had greater difficulty with the articulating instruments than with the conventional instruments (46 vs. 59). After a short orientation, however, the novices outscored the expert group in terms of net improvement in performance with the articulating instrument (27 vs. 1% improvement). Conclusion: Experienced surgeons are readily able to transfer their skills from conventional to articulating laparoscopic instruments. To speed the learning process, the use of articulating instruments can be started at an early stage of surgical training. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Articulating; Assessment; Laparoscopic instrument; Simulation; Skill acquisition; Surgical training","article; controlled study; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; medical practice; priority journal; surgical approach; surgical technique; surgical training; suturing method; task performance; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Graduate; Equipment Design; General Surgery; Humans; Laparoscopes; Laparoscopy; Suture Techniques; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449106556

Methods: Forty-five junior residents were randomized to learn basic surgical skills in either a self-directed or faculty-directed fashion. Residents returned to the laboratory 2 days later and were evaluated while performing 2 tasks: skin closure and bowel anastomosis. Outcome measures included Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill, time to completion, final product quality, and resident perceptions. Results: Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill, time to completion, and skin esthetic ratings were not better in the faculty-directed group, although isolated improvement in anastomotic leak pressure was seen. Residents perceived faculty-directed training to be superior. Conclusions: Our data provided minimal objective evidence that faculty-directed training improved transfer of learned skills to more complex tasks. Residents perceived that there was a benefit of faculty mentoring. Curriculum factors related to training of basic skills and subsequent transfer to more complex tasks may explain these contrasting results. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Stimulus-dependent changes in correlations can both carry information directly and modulate the information separately carried by the firing rates and variances. We use Fisher information to quantify these effects and show that, although stimulus-dependent correlations often carry little information directly, their modulatory effects on the overall information can be large. In particular, if the stimulus dependence is such that correlations increase with stimulus-induced firing rates, this can significantly enhance the information of the population when the structure of correlations is determined solely by the stimulus. However, in the presence of additional strong spatial decay of correlations, such stimulus dependence may have a negative impact. Opposite relationships hold when correlations decrease with firing rates.",,"action potential; algorithm; animal; article; biological model; brain; computer simulation; human; learning; nerve cell; nerve cell network; nerve tract; perception; physiology; synaptic transmission; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Brain; Computer Simulation; Generalization, Stimulus; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Neurons; Perception; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449699800

While recent work revealed the synchronizing influence of inhibitory coupling on the dynamics of many networks, it is known that strong coupling can destabilize phase-locked firing. Here we examine the loss of synchrony caused by an increase in inhibitory coupling in networks of type-I Morris-Lecar model oscillators, which is characterized by a period-doubling cascade and leads to mode-locked states with alternation in the firing order of the two cells, as reported recently by Maran and Canavier (J Comput Nerosci, 2008) for a network of Wang-Buzsáki model neurons. Although alternating-order firing has been previously reported as a near-synchronous state, we show that the stable phase difference between the spikes of the two Morris-Lecar cells can constitute as much as 70% of the unperturbed oscillation period. Further, we examine the generality of this phenomenon for a class of type-I oscillators that are close to their excitation thresholds, and provide an intuitive geometric description of such ""leap-frog"" dynamics. In the Morris-Lecar model network, the alternation in the firing order arises under the condition of fast closing of K+ channels at hyperpolarized potentials, which leads to slow dynamics of membrane potential upon synaptic inhibition, allowing the presynaptic cell to advance past the postsynaptic cell in each cycle of the oscillation. Further, we show that non-zero synaptic decay time is crucial for the existence of leap-frog firing in networks of phase oscillators. However, we demonstrate that leap-frog spiking can also be obtained in pulse-coupled inhibitory networks of one-dimensional oscillators with a multi-branched phase domain, for instance in a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire model cells. Finally, for the case of a homogeneous network, we establish quantitative conditions on the phase resetting properties of each cell necessary for stable alternating-order spiking, complementing the analysis of Goel and Ermentrout (Physica D 163:191-216, 2002) of the order-preserving phase transition map. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Inhibitory network; Leader switching; Non-synchronous dynamics; Non-weak coupling; Phase resetting; Spike-time response; Synaptic inhibition; Synchronization; Type-I excitability","potassium channel; alternating order firing; article; cell membrane potential; cell synchronization; controlled study; coupling strength; excitatory postsynaptic potential; hyperpolarization; inhibitory postsynaptic potential; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; nerve cell network; nerve conduction; nerve excitability; nervous system function; nervous system parameters; neuromodulation; oscillation; phase locked firing; presynaptic nerve; priority journal; spike time response curve; synaptic decay time; synaptic inhibition; synaptic transmission; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Models, Neurological; Neural Inhibition; Neurons; Potassium Channels; Synaptic Transmission; Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62349124668

An experiment directly comparing noun generalizations of children at the same point in development in forced-choice and yes/no tasks reveals task-specific differences in the way children's knowledge of nominal categories is brought to bear in a moment. To understand the cognitive system that produced these differences, the real-time decision processes in these tasks were instantiated in a dynamic field model. The model captures both qualitative and quantitative differences in performance across tasks and reveals constraints on the nature of children's accumulated knowledge. Additional simulations of developmental change in the yes/no task between 2 and 4 years of age illustrate how changes in children's representations translate into developmental changes in behavior. Together, the empirical data and model demonstrate the dynamic nature of knowledge and are consistent with the perspective that knowledge cannot be separated from the task-specific processes that create behavior in the moment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The technique is based on ""partition decoupled null models,"" a new class of null models that incorporate the interaction of clustered partitions into a random model and generalize the Gaussian ensemble. As an application, we analyze a correlation matrix derived from 4 years of close prices of equities in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ). In this example, we expose (i) a natural structure composed of 2 interacting partitions of the market that both agrees with and generalizes standard notions of scale (e.g., sector and industry) and (ii) structure in the first partition that is a topological manifestation of a well-known pattern of capital flow called ""sector rotation."" Our approach gives rise to a natural form of multiresolution analysis of the underlying time series that naturally decomposes the basic data in terms of the effects of the different scales at which it clusters. We support our conclusions and show the robustness of the technique with a successful analysis on a simulated network with an embedded topological structure. The equities market is a prototypical complex system, and we expect that our approach will be of use in understanding a broad class of complex systems in which correlation structures are resident. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Cluster analysis; Complex systems; Delaunay decomposition; Dimension reduction; Multiscale","article; cluster analysis; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; priority journal; social marketing; social network; social structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58549089495

Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are associated with substantially higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to infections caused by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria. The emergence and spread of these bacteria is complex and requires incorporating numerous interrelated factors which clinical studies cannot adequately address. Methods/Principal Findings: A model is created which incorporates several key factors contributing to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria including the effects of the immune system, acquisition of resistance genes and antimicrobial exposure. The model identifies key strategies which would limit the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains. Specifically, the simulations show that early initiation of antimicrobial therapy and combination therapy with two antibiotics prevents the emergence of resistant bacteria, whereas shorter courses of therapy and sequential administration of antibiotics promote the emergence of resistant strains. Conclusions/Significance: The principal findings suggest that (i) shorter lengths of antibiotic therapy and early interruption of antibiotic therapy provide an advantage for the resistant strains, (ii) combination therapy with two antibiotics prevents the emergence of resistance strains in contrast to sequential antibiotic therapy, and (iii) early initiation of antibiotics is among the most important factors preventing the emergence of resistant strains. These findings provide new insights into strategies aimed at optimizing the administration of antimicrobials for the treatment of infections and the prevention of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. © 2008 D'Agata et al.",,"antibiotic agent; multidrug resistance protein; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; article; bacterial strain; controlled study; drug exposure; immune response; mathematical model; nonhuman; short course therapy; simulation; treatment duration; treatment withdrawal; algorithm; bacterium; biological model; drug effect; gene transfer; genetics; human; immune system; infection control; metabolism; microbiological examination; multidrug resistance; plasmid; theoretical model; Bacteria (microorganisms); Algorithms; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Gene Transfer Techniques; Humans; Immune System; Infection Control; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Models, Biological; Models, Theoretical; Plasmids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149193216

We show how the problem can be characterized as a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Bernoulli distribution. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach is more accurate in estimating the underlying template in the absence of internal noise. With increasing internal noise, however, the advantage of the GLM over the LM decreases and GLM is no more accurate than LM. We then introduce the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), an extension of GLM that can be used to estimate smooth classification images adaptively. We show that this approach is more robust to the presence of internal noise, and finally, we demonstrate that GAM is readily adapted to estimation of higher order (nonlinear) classification images and to testing their significance. © ARVO.","Classification images; GAM; Generalized additive models; Generalized linear models; GLM; Signal detection theory","article; artifact; classification; comparative study; computer simulation; human; nonlinear system; perceptive discrimination; physiology; statistical model; vision; Artifacts; Classification; Computer Simulation; Humans; Linear Models; Nonlinear Dynamics; Signal Detection, Psychological; Vision, Ocular; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049087182

However, these services need to be more accessible and personalized including the ability to display multiple languages in a single interface or a geo-spatial Web Site in terms of 'on-the-fly' map representation and decoration for international visitors. This paper is proposed a multilingual-based approach which a SVG based map is the primary source for preparing a multilingual Web map. According to the basic concepts or principles of map decoration, the paper gives not only an ontological model of map representation and decoration but also indicates clearly that the general issues and main theories and methods of multilingual text on Web mapping. Then, it combines different techniques to decorate the Web map such as SVG specification, four color theorem and line simplification. In order to handle the concurrent hierarchies in geometric context of the map, a geometric view of the solution, a segment tree structure and range-query structure were adapted to solve the issues of text kerning along the curve and multilingual text overlap on one point or coordinate in particular multidimensional or multi-element ones. By the experiments, this approach can be used to implement the spatial query like accessing spatial geometric elements and attributes and it can also be creating maps on-the-fly for multilingual map generalization and integration.

A major limitation to improving human factors and teamwork is the paucity of objective validated measurement tools. Our goal was to develop a brief tool that could be used to objectively evaluate teamwork in the field during short clinical team simulations and in everyday clinical care. Study Design: A pilot validation study. Standardized videos were created demonstrating poor, average, and excellent teamwork among an obstetric team in a common clinical scenario (shoulder dystocia). Three evaluators all trained in Crew Resource Management, and unaware of assigned teamwork level, independently reviewed videos and evaluated teamwork using the Clinical Teamwork Scale (CTS). Statistical analysis included calculation of the Kappa statistic and Kendall coefficient to evaluate agreement and score concordance among raters, and Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) to evaluate interrater reliability. The reliability of the tool was further evaluated by estimating the variance of each component of the tool based on generalizability theory. Results: There was substantial agreement (Kappa 0.78) and score concordance (Kendall coefficient 0.95) among raters, and excellent interrater reliability (interclass correlation coefficient 0.98). The highest percentage of variance in scores among raters was because of rater/item interaction. Conclusion: The CTS was developed to efficiently measure key clinical teamwork skills during simulation exercises and in everyday clinical care. It contains 15 questions in 5 clinical teamwork domains (communication, situational awareness, decisionmaking, role responsibility, and patient friendliness).

Opt. 45,6860-6875 (2006)]. In that paper we superimposed two orthogonal plane-parallel layers to compute the radiance due to a two-dimensional (2D) rectangular aerosol cloud. In this paper we revisit the model and correct an error in the interaction of the two layers. We derive new expressions relating to the signal content of the radiance from an aerosol cloud based on the concept of five directional thermal contrasts: four for the 2D diffuse radiance and one for direct radiance along the line of sight. The new expressions give additional insight on the radiative transfer processes within the cloud. Simulations for Bacillus subtilis var. niger (BG) bioaerosol and dustlike kaolin aerosol clouds are compared and contrasted for two geometries: an airborne sensor looking down and a ground-based sensor looking up. Simulation results suggest that aerosol cloud detection from an airborne platform may be more challenging than for a ground-based sensor and that the detection of an aerosol cloud in emission mode (negative direct thermal contrast) is not the same as the detection of an aerosol cloud in absorption mode (positive direct thermal contrast). © 2008 Optical Society of America.",,"Aircraft detection; Bacteriology; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Airborne platforms; Bacillus Subtilis; Ground based sensors; Infrared wavelengths; Passive remote sensing; Radiative transfer model; Radiative transfer process; Two Dimensional (2 D); Aerosols; kaolin; aerosol; air; algorithm; article; Bacillus subtilis; chemical model; computer simulation; dust; environmental monitoring; equipment design; metabolism; methodology; optics; reproducibility; statistical model; Aerosols; Air Movements; Algorithms; Bacillus subtilis; Computer Simulation; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment Design; Kaolin; Models, Chemical; Models, Statistical; Optics and Photonics; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60649090077

Attempts to detect the fine temporal structure of task-related activity would benefit from functional imaging methods allowing higher sampling rates. Spatial filtering techniques have been used in magnetoencephalography source imaging applications. In this work, we use the linear constraint minimal variance (LCMV) beamformer localization method to reconstruct single-shot volumetric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using signals acquired simultaneously from all channels of a high density radio-frequency (RF) coil array. The LCMV beamformer method generalizes the existing volumetric magnetic resonance inverse imaging (InI) technique, achieving higher detection sensitivity while maintaining whole-brain spatial coverage and 100 ms temporal resolution. In this paper, we begin by introducing the LCMV reconstruction formulation and then quantitatively assess its performance using both simulated and empirical data. To demonstrate the sensitivity and inter-subject reliability of volumetric LCMV InI, we employ an event-related design to probe the spatial and temporal properties of task-related hemodynamic signal modulations in primary visual cortex. Compared to minimum-norm estimate (MNE) reconstructions, LCMV offers better localization accuracy and superior detection sensitivity. Robust results from both single subject and group analyses demonstrate the excellent sensitivity and specificity of volumetric InI in detecting the spatial and temporal structure of task-related brain activity. © 2008.","Event-related; fMRI; InI; Inverse solution; LCMV; Magnetoencephalography; MEG; MRI; Neuroimaging; Rapid imaging; Visual","accuracy; article; brain; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hemodynamics; human; normal human; performance; priority journal; radiofrequency; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; visual cortex; volumetry; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Transducers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53049100733

Hodgkin identified three classes of neurons with qualitatively different analog-to-digital transduction properties. Despite widespread use of this classification scheme, a generalizable explanation of its biophysical basis has not been described. We recorded from spinal sensory neurons representing each class and reproduced their transduction properties in a minimal model. With phase plane and bifurcation analysis, each class of excitability was shown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics. Excitability could be converted between all three classes by varying single parameters; moreover, several parameters, when varied one at a time, had functionally equivalent effects on excitability. From this, we conclude that the spike-initiating dynamics associated with each of Hodgkin's classes represent different outcomes in a nonlinear competition between oppositely directed, kinetically mismatched currents. Class 1 excitability occurs through a saddle node on invariant circle bifurcation when net current at perithreshold potentials is inward (depolarizing) at steady state. Class 2 excitability occurs through a Hopf bifurcation when, despite net current being outward (hyperpolarizing) at steady state, spike initiation occurs because inward current activates faster than outward current. Class 3 excitability occurs through a quasi-separatrix crossing when fast-activating inward current overpowers slow-activating outward current during a stimulus transient, although slow-activating outward current dominates during constant stimulation. Experiments confirmed that different classes of spinal lamina I neurons express the subthreshold currents predicted by our simulations and, further, that those currents are necessary for the excitability in each cell class. Thus, our results demonstrate that all three classes of excitability arise from a continuum in the direction and magnitude of subthreshold currents. Through detailed analysis of the spike-initiating process, we have explained a fundamental link between biophysical properties and qualitative differences in how neurons encode sensory input. © 2008 Prescott et al.",,"article; controlled study; male; nerve cell excitability; nerve cell stimulation; nonhuman; rat; Reed Sternberg cell; sensory nerve cell; sensory stimulation; signal transduction; spinal cord nerve cell; action potential; animal; biological model; biology; biophysics; classification; cytology; electrophysiology; in vitro study; physiology; spinal nerve; Sprague Dawley rat; Action Potentials; Animals; Biophysics; Computational Biology; Electrophysiology; Male; Models, Neurological; Neurons, Afferent; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Spinal Nerves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55449122549

Although many channel proteins conducting these currents are phylogenetically conserved, channels of the same type in different animals can have different voltage dependencies and dynamics. What does this mean for our ability to derive rules about the role of different types of ion channels in neuronal activity? Can results about the role of a particular channel type in a particular type of neuron be generalized to other neuron types? We compare spiking model neurons in two databases constructed by exploring the maximal conductance spaces of two models. The first is a model of crustacean stomatogastric neurons, and the second is a model of rodent thalamocortical neurons, but both models contain similar types of membrane currents. Spiking neurons in both databases show distinct fast and slow subpopulations, but our analysis reveals that related currents play different roles in fast and slow spiking in the stomatogastric versus thalamocortical neurons. This analysis involved conductance-space visualization and comparison of voltage traces, current traces, and frequency-current relationships from all spiker subpopulations. Our results are consistent with previous work indicating that the role a membrane current plays in shaping a neuron's behavior depends on the voltage dependence and dynamics of that current and may be different in different neuron types depending on the properties of other currents it is interacting with. Conclusions about the function of a type of membrane current based on experiments or simulations in one type of neuron may therefore not generalize to other neuron types.

The objective of this study was to develop an experimental technique to allow the contact pressures on the tibial plateau of cadaveric knees to be measured under dynamic physiological loads. Accordingly, we adapted a load-controlled knee joint simulator to accept a cadaveric sheep knee, programmed the simulator with sheep gait kinematics data, and utilized a pressure sensor array to measure the contact pressure distribution on the lateral tibial plateau during gait. The technique was applied to six sheep knees that were tested intact and after meniscectomy. Meniscectomy resulted in a 267% increase in average contact pressure, a 117% increase in peak contact pressure, and an 80% decrease in contact area, all measured at the point of maximum peak contact stress in the gait cycle. It is envisaged that the experimental model herein developed will allow for the screening of candidate materials prior to more expensive and time-consuming animal models. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Z ring forms at the division plane and is attached to the membrane. After assembly, it maintains a stable yet dynamic steady state. Once induced, the ring contracts and the membrane constricts. In this work, we present a computational deterministic biochemical model exhibiting this behavior. The model is based on biochemical features of FtsZ known from in vitro studies, and it quantitatively reproduces relevant in vitro data. An essential part of the model is a consideration of interfacial reactions involving the cytosol volume, where monomeric FtsZ is dispersed, and the membrane surface in the cell's midzone where the ring is assembled. This approach allows the same chemical model to simulate either in vitro or in vivo conditions by adjusting only two geometrical parameters. The model includes minimal reactions, components, and assumptions, yet is able to reproduce sought-after in vivo behavior, including the rapid assembly of the ring via FtsZ-polymerization, the formation of a dynamic steady state in which GTP hydrolysis leads to the exchange of monomeric subunits between cytoplasm and the ring, and finally the induced contraction of the ring. The model gives a quantitative estimate for coupling between the rate of GTP hydrolysis and of FtsZ subunit turnover between the assembled ring and the cytoplasmic pool as observed. Membrane constriction is chemically driven by the strong tendency of GTP-bound FtsZ to self-assembly. The model suggests a possible mechanism of membrane contraction without a motor protein. The portion of the free energy of GTP hydrolysis released in cyclization is indirectly used in this energetically unfavorable process. The model provides a limit to the mechanistic complexity required to mimic ring behavior, and it highlights the importance of parallel in vitro and in vivo modeling. © 2008 Surovtsev et al.",,"FtsZ protein; bacterial protein; cytoskeleton protein; FtsZ protein, Bacteria; guanine nucleotide binding protein; article; cytokinesis; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; nonhuman; prokaryote; protein analysis; protein assembly; protein polymerization; protein structure; steady state; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; dimerization; energy transfer; kinetics; metabolism; methodology; physiology; protein binding; systems biology; thermodynamics; Prokaryota; Bacterial Proteins; Computer Simulation; Cytokinesis; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Dimerization; Energy Transfer; GTP-Binding Proteins; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Protein Binding; Systems Biology; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249089312

It is unclear, however, whether such evaluations may be overly biased by respondents' rating styles, which may lead to unreliable measurement of examinees' communication skills. Methods: Our study involved 212 students from the classes of 2005 and 2006 at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. All students were rated by actors depicting standardised patients (SPs) on the same seven cases using the 19-item Rochester Communication Rating Scale (RCRS). Different students were assigned to different actors playing the same SP. We assessed the extent to which actors' personal rating styles influenced the scores they assigned to students. Main outcome measures were: between-actor variability in responses; the degree to which actors' response styles contribute to overall scores, and improvements in reliability achieved by standardising actors' ratings. Results: There were statistically significant differences between actors in their mean assigned scores. Scores aggregated over 18 separate SP cases have an expected generalisability coefficient of 0.79. If raw RCRS scores are used, a total of 27 replications of the RCRS are required to achieve a Cronbach's alpha of 0.8; standardisation reduces this number to 18. Conclusions: Although actors are variable in their use of a standardised subjective scale of communication, such differences contribute to an acceptably small proportion of the total variance if scores are combined across a large number of cases. Reliability can be markedly improved by standardising scores across raters. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.","*communication; *patient standardisation; Clinical competence/*standards; Education, dental/*methods; Education, medical, undergraduate/*methods; Humans; New York; Patient satisfaction; Physician-patient relations","article; communication skill; Cronbach alpha coefficient; medical education; medical school; medical student; outcome assessment; patient assessment; rating scale; reliability; scoring system; standardization; Clinical Competence; Communication; Decision Support Techniques; Education, Dental; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; New York; Patient Satisfaction; Patient Simulation; Physician-Patient Relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949147917

In model based OPC, masks are systematically modified to compensate for the non-ideal optical and process effects of optical lithography system. The polygons in the layout are fragmented, and simulations are performed to determine the image intensity pattern on the wafer. Then the mask is perturbed by moving the fragments to match the desired wafer pattern. This iterative process continues until the pattern on the wafer matches the desired one. Although OPC increases the fidelity of pattern transfer to the wafer, it is quite CPU intensive; OPC for modern IC designs can take days to complete on computer clusters with thousands of CPU. In this paper, techniques from statistical machine learning are used to predict the fragment movements. The goal is to reduce the number of iterations required in model based OPC by using a fast and efficient solution as the initial guess to model based OPC.

The fact that genes within a pathway tend to interact with each other and relate to the outcome in a complicated way makes nonparametric methods more desirable. The kernel machine method provides a convenient, powerful and unified method for multi-dimensional parametric and nonparametric modeling of the pathway effect. Results: In this paper we propose a logistic kernel machine regression model for binary outcomes. This model relates the disease risk to covariates parametrically, and to genes within a genetic pathway parametrically or nonparametrically using kernel machines. The nonparametric genetic pathway effect allows for possible interactions among the genes within the same pathway and a complicated relationship of the genetic pathway and the outcome. We show that kernel machine estimation of the model components can be formulated using a logistic mixed model. Estimation hence can proceed within a mixed model framework using standard statistical software. A score test based on a Gaussian process approximation is developed to test for the genetic pathway effect. The methods are illustrated using a prostate cancer data set and evaluated using simulations. An extension to continuous and discrete outcomes using generalized kernel machine models and its connection with generalized linear mixed models is discussed. Conclusion: Logistic kernel machine regression and its extension generalized kernel machine regression provide a novel and flexible statistical tool for modeling pathway effects on discrete and continuous outcomes. Their close connection to mixed models and attractive performance make them have promising wide applications in bioinformatics and other biomedical areas. © 2008 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Biological pathways; Gaussian Processes; Generalized kernels; Generalized linear mixed models; Non-parametric model; Nonparametric methods; Statistical software; Statistical tools; Bioinformatics; Bit error rate; Estimation; Genes; Regression analysis; Statistical mechanics; Machine components; article; data analysis software; gene interaction; kernel method; logistic regression analysis; parametric test; prostate cancer; risk assessment; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical model; support vector machine; artificial intelligence; biological model; biometry; computer program; feedback system; gene; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; male; methodology; nonparametric test; prostate tumor; statistical model; statistics; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Feedback; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes; Humans; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Models, Genetic; Prostatic Neoplasms; Research Design; Risk Assessment; Software; Statistics, Nonparametric",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249142391

This work investigates PET acquisition mode, reconstruction method and a standard uptake value (SUV) correction scheme on the classification of lesions as benign or malignant in PET/CT images, in an anthropomorphic phantom. The scheme accounts for partial volume effect (PVE) and PET resolution. The observer draws a region of interest (ROI) around the lesion using the CT dataset. A simulated homogenous PET lesion of the same shape as the drawn ROI is blurred with the point spread function (PSF) of the PET scanner to estimate the PVE, providing a scaling factor to produce a corrected SUV. Computer simulations showed that the accuracy of the corrected PET values depends on variations in the CT-drawn boundary and the position of the lesion with respect to the PET image matrix, especially for smaller lesions. Correction accuracy was affected slightly by mismatch of the simulation PSF and the actual scanner PSF. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study resulted in several observations. Using observer drawn ROIs, scaled tumor-background ratios (TBRs) more accurately represented actual TBRs than unscaled TBRs. For the PET images, 3D OSEM outperformed 2D OSEM, 3D OSEM outperformed 3D FBP, and 2D OSEM outperformed 2D FBP. The correction scheme significantly increased sensitivity and slightly increased accuracy for all acquisition and reconstruction modes at the cost of a small decrease in specificity.","Multi-modality imaging; Observer performance evaluation; Partial volume effect; PET/CT; Quantitative image analysis; ROC analysis; Standard uptake value","Anthropomorphic phantoms; Computed Tomography (CT); Correction accuracy; Data sets; Detectability; Diagnostic tools; False negatives; False positive (FP); Image matrix; Image perception; Observer (OBS); Observer performances; Partial volume effect (PVE); PET imaging; PET scanners; Point Spread Function (PSF); Positron emission tomography (PET); Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC); Reconstruction methods; Region -of-interest (ROI); Scaling factors; Standard uptake value (SUV); Technology assessment (TA); Acoustic emissions; Classification (of information); Computational methods; Computer networks; Computer simulation; Computerized tomography; Diagnostic radiography; Electric instrument transformers; Health; Image enhancement; Image quality; Imaging techniques; Medical imaging; Mergers and acquisitions; Multitasking; Optical transfer function; Positron annihilation spectroscopy; Repair; Restoration; Scanning; Sensitivity analysis; Standards; Technological forecasting; Technology; Technology transfer; Thermography (temperature measurement); Three dimensional; Tomography; Positron emission tomography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949084635

It is proposed that this interaction is under tight regulation; however the signaling/regulatory components of Dg-Dys complex remain elusive. Understanding the regulation of the complex is critical since defects in this complex cause muscular dystrophy in humans. To reveal new regulators of the Dg-Dys complex, we used a model organism Drosophila melanogaster and performed genetic interaction screens to identify modifiers of Dg and Dys mutants in Drosophila wing veins. These mutant screens revealed that the Dg-Dys complex interacts with genes involved in muscle function and components of Notch, TGF-β and EGFR signaling pathways. In addition, components of pathways that are required for cellular and/or axonal migration through cytoskeletal regulation, such as Semaphorin-Plexin, Frazzled-Netrin and Slit-Robo pathways show interactions with Dys and/or Dg. These data suggest that the Dg-Dys complex and the other pathways regulating extracellular information transfer to the cytoskeletal dynamics are more intercalated than previously thought. © 2008 Kucherenko et al.",,"dystroglycan; dystrophin; epidermal growth factor receptor; netrin; Notch receptor; plexin; roundabout receptor; semaphorin; Slit protein; syndecan; transforming growth factor beta; Drosophila protein; dystroglycan; dystrophin; epidermal growth factor receptor; notch protein, Drosophila; Notch receptor; transforming growth factor beta; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell migration; complex formation; cytoskeleton; Drosophila melanogaster; female; gene function; gene interaction; genetic screening; muscle development; muscle function; mutant; nerve fiber; nonhuman; signal transduction; animal; Drosophila melanogaster; genetics; metabolism; mutation; Drosophila melanogaster; Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Dystroglycans; Dystrophin; Mutation; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction; Transforming Growth Factor beta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749089967

If we know the function of bacterial proteins we will be able to understand how these species have adapted to diverse environments including many extreme habitats. Here we present the protein interaction network for the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum which ehcodes 1,039 proteins, 726 (or 70%) of which interact via 3,649 interactions as revealed by systematic yeast two-hybrid screens. A high-confidence subset of 991 interactions links 576 proteins. To derive further biological insights from our data, we constructed an integrated network of proteins involved in DNA metabolism. Combining our data with additional evidences, we provide improved annotations for at least 18 proteins (including TP0004, TP0050, and TP0183 which are suggested to be involved in DNA metabolism). We estimate that this ""minimal"" bacterium contains on the order of 3,000 protein interactions. Profiles of functional interconnections indicate that bacterial proteins interact more promiscuously than eukaryotic proteins, reflecting the non-compartmentalized structure of the bacterial cell.

Subjects wore an instrumented glove that recorded finger motions. A linear transformation matrix projected joint angle signals (a high-dimensional control vector) onto a two-dimensional cursor position on a video monitor. We assessed how visual information influences learning and generalization of novel finger coordination patterns as subjects practiced using hand gestures to manipulate cursor location. Three groups of test subjects practiced moving a visible cursor between different sets of screen targets. The hand-to-screen transformation was designed such that the different sets of targets (which we called implicit spatial cues) varied in how informative they were about the gestures to be learned. A separate control group practiced gesturing with explicit cues (pictures of desired gestures) without ongoing cursor feedback. Another control group received implicit spatial cueing and feedback only of final cursor position. We found that test subjects and subjects provided with explicit cues could learn to produce desired gestures, although training efficacy decreased as the amount of task-relevant feedback decreased. Although both control groups learned to associate screen targets with specific gestures, only subjects provided with online feedback of cursor motion learned to generalize in a manner consistent with the internal representation of an inverse hand-to-screen mapping. These findings suggest that spatial learning and generalization require dynamic feedback of object motion in response to control signal changes; static information regarding geometric relationships between controller and endpoint configurations does not suffice.

Background: Surgeons find the endoscopic/laparoscopic surgery procedure to be more mentally stressful than open surgery. This investigation was designed to identify specific stress dimensions associated with these procedures and to determine the contributions to that stress made by loss of depth information resulting from image-guided views of the surgical field and by disruption of eye-hand mapping. Because stress reactions might depend upon familiarity with these procedures, the study focused upon novice participants. Method: An endoscopic box-simulator featured in surgical training was used in conjunction with the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire, a well-validated multidimensional stress state instrument. A control group (no perceptual distortions) viewed the simulated ""surgical field"" directly. Two other groups viewed the surgical field through TV images in which spatial rotation of the images was absent or in which the images were rotated 90° from the actual line of sight. Results: Performance efficiency in the simulator varied inversely with the degree of perceptual-motor distortion. Reactions reflecting increased task coping were observed in all groups. These were accompanied in the image groups by negative reactions involving decreases in hedonic tone and control and confidence and an increase in tense arousal. Conclusions: Perceptual-motor distortions are sources of complex task-induced stress profiles in novices using an endoscopic surgery simulator.

We demonstrate quantitatively that the experience of the sensory consequences of its voluntary motor actions allows an organism to learn the spatial location of any sound source. Using examples from humans and echolocating bats, our model shows that a naive organism can learn the auditory space based solely on acoustic inputs and their relation to motor states. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"algorithm; animal; article; association; bat; biological model; computer simulation; depth perception; echolocation; feedback system; head movement; human; learning; physiology; psychomotor performance; sound detection; touch; vision; Algorithms; Animals; Chiroptera; Computer Simulation; Cues; Echolocation; Feedback; Head Movements; Humans; Learning; Models, Neurological; Psychomotor Performance; Sound Localization; Space Perception; Touch; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549142403

The degree and pattern of this generalization are of great importance in deducing the underlying mechanisms that govern our motor control. In this report we expand our knowledge on the generalization between movements made at different speeds. We wished to determine the pattern of generalization between different speed and duration movements on a trial-by-trial basis. In addition, we tested three hypotheses for the pattern of generalization. The first hypothesis was that the generalization was maximum for the speed of the movement just made with a linear decrease in generalization as one moves away from that preferred speed. The second was that the generalization is always highest for the fastest speed movements and linearly decreases with speed. The last hypothesis came from our preliminary results, which suggested that the generalization plateaus. Human subjects made targeted reaching movements at four different maximum speeds (15, 35, 55 and 75 cm/s) presented in pseudorandom order to one spatial target (15 cm extent) while holding onto a robotic manipulandum that produced a viscous curl field. Catch trials (trial where the curl field was unexpectedly removed) were used to probe the generalization between the four speed/durations on a movement-by-movement basis. We found that the pattern of generalization was linear between the first three speed categories (15-55 cm/s), but plateaued after the 55 cm/s category. We compared the subjects' results with a simulated adaptive controller that used a population code by combining the output of basis elements. These basis elements encoded limb velocity and associated this with a force expectation at that velocity. We found that using a basis set of Gaussians the adaptive controller produced movements that generalized in virtually the exact manner as the subjects, as we have previously demonstrated for movements made to different spatial targets. Thus, the human internal model may employ such a population code. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Arm; Basis function; Force field; Manipulandum; Motor learning; Reaching; Speed; Velocity","adult; arm movement; article; force; human; human experiment; hypothesis; kinematics; learning; motion; normal distribution; normal human; priority journal; sensorimotor function; simulation; velocity; Adult; Arm; Hand; Humans; Models, Biological; Motor Activity; Movement; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Robotics; Space Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40149104569

However, because of a random permutation among output components, ICA does not offer a straightforward solution for the inference of group-level activation. In this study, we present an independent vector analysis (IVA) method to address the permutation problem during fMRI group data analysis. In comparison to ICA, IVA offers an analysis of additional dependent components, which were assigned for use in the automated grouping of dependent activation patterns across subjects. Upon testing using simulated trial-based fMRI data, our proposed method was applied to real fMRI data employing both a single-trial task-paradigm (right hand motor clenching and internal speech generation tasks) and a three-trial task-paradigm (right hand motor imagery task). A generalized linear model (GLM) and the group ICA of the fMRI toolbox (GIFT) were also applied to the same data set for comparison to IVA. Compared to GLM, IVA successfully captured activation patterns even when the functional areas showed variable hemodynamic responses that deviated from a hypothesized response. We also showed that IVA effectively inferred group-activation patterns of unknown origins without the requirement for a pre-processing stage (such as data concatenation in ICA-based GIFT). IVA can be used as a potential alternative or an adjunct to current ICA-based fMRI group processing methods. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The mechanisms were designed to behave as similarly as possible to a human patient. The engineering team designed the eclampsia mechanism to jostle the mannequin's head at a frequency and randomness that matched those observed in human generalized seizures. The hemorrhage mechanism was designed to give visual and tactile cues similar to the actual physiology of a pregnant uterus. Both devices were remote controlled. RESULTS: The hemorrhage mechanism was used in a scenario of an amniotic fluid embolism with severe postpartum hemorrhage. The final flow rate was adjustable between 525 and 600 mL/min. The trainees' rapid response and control of the postpartum hemorrhage was deemed to be a vital part of a successful maternal resuscitation. The seizure mechanism was used in a simulation of a pregnant woman in labor with evidence of severe preeclampsia. If the trainees did not recognize the need for treatment of the preeclampsia, the patient simulator had a 45- to 60-second seizure. If corrective actions were not taken, another seizure occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The use of remote controlled mechanical devices designed to accurately replicate the visual, auditory, and tactile cues of hemorrhage and eclampsia enhanced high fidelity simulation training in obstetrical emergencies.

In a trajectory-reversal task (""slicing""), the hand reversed direction within the target and returned to the origin. In a positioning task (""reaching""), subjects moved the hand to the target and held it there; cursor feedback was provided only after movement ended to isolate learning of final position from trajectory direction. We asked whether learning acquired in one task would transfer to the other. Transfer would suggest that the hand's entire trajectory, including its endpoint, was controlled using a common spatial plan. Instead we found minimal transfer, suggesting that the brain used different representations of target position to specify the hand's initial trajectory and its final stabilized position. We also observed asymmetrical practice effects on hand trajectory, including systematic curvature of reaches made after rotation training and hypermetria of untrained slice reversals after reach training. These are difficult to explain with a unified control model, but were replicated in computer simulations that specified the hand's initial trajectory and its final equilibrium position. Our results suggest that the brain uses different mechanisms to plan the hand's initial trajectory and final position in point-to-point movements, that it implements these control actions sequentially, and that trajectory planning does not account for specific impedance values to be implemented about the final stabilized posture.

Predicting peptides that bind to a specific MHC molecule plays an important role in determining potential candidates for vaccines. The binding groove in class II MHC is open at both ends, allowing peptides longer than 9-mer to bind. Finding the consensus motif facilitating the binding of peptides to a MHC class II molecule is difficult because of different lengths of binding peptides and varying location of 9-mer binding core. The level of difficulty increases when the molecule is promiscuous and binds to a large number of low affinity peptides. In this paper, we propose two approaches using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) for predicting peptides binding to MHC class II molecules. One uses the information from both binders and non-binders for self-discovery of motifs. The other, in addition, uses information from experimentally determined motifs for guided-discovery of motifs. Results: The proposed methods are intended for finding peptides binding to MHC class II I-Ag7 molecule - a promiscuous binder to a large number of low affinity peptides. Cross-validation results across experiments on two motifs derived for I-Ag7 datasets demonstrate better generalization abilities and accuracies of the present method over earlier approaches. Further, the proposed method was validated and compared on two publicly available benchmark datasets: (1) an ensemble of qualitative HLA-DRB1*0401 peptide data obtained from five different sources, and (2) quantitative peptide data obtained for sixteen different alleles comprising of three mouse alleles and thirteen HLA alleles. The proposed method outperformed earlier methods on most datasets, indicating that it is well suited for finding peptides binding to MHC class II molecules. Conclusion: We present two MOEA-based algorithms for finding motifs, one for self-discovery and the other for guided-discovery by experimentally determined motifs, and thereby predicting binding peptides to I-Ag7 molecule. Our experiments show that the proposed MOEA-based algorithms are better than earlier methods in predicting binding sites not only on I-Ag7 but also on most alleles of class II MHC benchmark datasets. This shows that our methods could be applicable to find binding motifs in a wide range of alleles. © 2007 Rajapakse et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Affinity peptides; Benchmark datasets; Cross validation; Generalization ability; Immune response; Level of difficulties; Major histocompatibility complex class; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Algorithms; Binders; Experiments; Forecasting; Genes; Molecules; Silver; Peptides; HLA DR antigen; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; HLA antigen; peptide; accuracy; allele; area under the curve; article; binding affinity; controlled study; evolutionary algorithm; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; nonhuman; prediction; protein binding; protein motif; protein protein interaction; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; validation study; binding site; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; methodology; protein analysis; protein binding; protein tertiary structure; sequence analysis; Binding Sites; Computer Simulation; HLA Antigens; Models, Chemical; Peptides; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Sequence Analysis, Protein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549105061

The multiple-LOS capability is based on DISORT and exploits the existing MODTRAN-DISORT interface. kURT-MS is a new sensor-specific correlated-k (c-k) ultra-fast radiative transfer formalism for UV-visible to LWIR wavelengths that is derived from MODTRAN's correlated-k parameters. Scattering parameters, blackbody and solar functions are cast as compact k-dependent source terms and used in the radiance computations. Preliminary transmittance results are within 2% of MODTRAN with a two-orders-of-magnitude computational savings. Preliminary radiance computations in the visible spectrum are within a few percent of MODTRAN results, but with orders of magnitude speed up over comparable MODTRAN runs. This new RT capability has potential applications for hyperspectral scene simulations as well as target acquisition algorithms for near earth scenarios.","Correlated-k; DISORT; kURT; Look-up-tables; MODTRAN; Multiple lines-of-sight; Multiple scattering","Bandpass radiance; Broad-bandpass; Radiation transport (RT); Algorithms; Argon; Computer simulation; Data reduction; Light scattering; Wavelength; Ultraviolet radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948995837

Typically, detection is accomplished by comparing the detection statistic for each test pixel to a threshold. If the statistic exceeds the threshold, a potential target is declared. The threshold is usually selected to achieve a given probability of false alarm. In addition, in surveillance applications, it is almost always required that the system will maintain a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) as the background distribution changes. This objective is usually accomplished by adaptively estimating the background statistics and adjusting the threshold accordingly. In this paper we propose and study CFAR threshold selection techniques, based on tail extrapolation, for a detector operating on hyperspectral imaging data. The basic idea is to obtain reliable estimates of the background statistics at low false alarm rates, and then extend these estimates beyond the range supported by the data to predict the thresholds at lower false alarm rates. The proposed techniques are based on the assumption that the distribution in the tail region of the detection statistics is accurately characterized by a member of the extreme value distributions. We focus on the generalized Pareto distribution. The evaluation of the proposed techniques will be done with both simulated data and real hyperspectral imaging data collected using the Army Night Vision Laboratory COMPASS sensor.","Background characterization; Hyperspectral imaging; Statistical modeling; Target detection","Background characterization; Constant false alarm rate (CFAR); Hyperspectral imaging; Statistical modeling; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Pareto principle; Pixels; Statistics; Target tracking; Image analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948963337

These proteins transfer the excitation energy with almost 100% quantum efficiency to the reaction centers, where charge separation takes place. The time scale and pathways of this transfer are controlled by the protein scaffold, which holds the pigments at optimal geometry and tunes their excitation energies (site energies). The detailed understanding of the tuning of site energies by the protein has been an unsolved problem since the first high-resolution crystal structure of a light-harvesting antenna appeared >30 years ago [Fenna RE, Matthews BW (1975) Nature 258:573-577]. Here, we present a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic approach to compute site energies that considers the whole protein in atomic detail and provides the missing link between crystallography and spectroscopy. The calculation of site energies of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein results in optical spectra that are in quantitative agreement with experiment and reveals an unexpectedly strong influence of the backbone of two α-helices. The electric field from the latter defines the direction of excitation energy flow in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein, whereas the effects of amino acid side chains, hitherto thought to be crucial, largely compensate each other. This result challenges the current view of how energy flow is regulated in pigment-protein complexes and demonstrates that attention has to be paid to the backbone architecture. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Energy transfer; Light-harvesting; Optical spectra; Photosynthesis; Structure-based simulation","antennapedia protein; bacterial protein; pigment; protein fenna matthews olsen; unclassified drug; alpha helix; amino acid sequence; article; Chlorobi; chromatophore; crystal structure; crystallography; electricity; energy transfer; photosynthesis; priority journal; protein interaction; protein structure; protein transport; quantum chemistry; simulation; spectroscopy; spectrum; Chlorobi; Circular Dichroism; Computer Simulation; Energy Transfer; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins; Pigments, Biological; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36749038320

Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network.

At low frequency, strain response is strongly related to charge accumulation at the electrodes. Experimental results demonstrated using conducting powder, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), polyaniline (PANI) powders, high surface area RuO 2, carbon black electrodes etc. as an electrode increases the mechanical deformation of the IPT by increasing the capacitance of the material. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulation of a two-dimensional ion hopping model has been built to describe ion transport in the IPT. The shape of the conducting powder is assumed to be a sphere. A step voltage is applied between the electrodes of the IPT, causing the thermally-activated hopping between multiwell energy structures. Energy barrier height includes three parts: the energy height due to the external electric potential, intrinsic energy, and the energy height due to ion interactions. Finite element method software-ANSYS is employed to calculate the static electric potential distribution inside the material with the powder sphere in varied locations. The interaction between ions and the electrodes including powder electrodes is determined by using the method of images. At each simulation step, the energy of each cation is updated to compute ion hopping rate which directly relates to the probability of an ion moving to its neighboring site. Simulation ends when the current drops to constant zero. Periodic boundary conditions are applied when ions hop in the direction perpendicular to the external electric field. When an ion is moved out of the simulation region, its corresponding periodic replica enters from the opposite side. In the direction of the external electric field, parallel programming is achieved in C augmented with functions that perform message-passing between processors using Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. The effects of conducting powder size, locations and amount are discussed by studying the stationary charge density plots and ion distribution plots.","Ion hopping model; Ionic polymer transducer; Monte-Carlo simulation; Powder electrodes","Charge density plots; Intrinsic energy; Ion hopping model; Message Passing Interface; Boundary conditions; Computer simulation; Electric potential; Electrodes; Finite element method; Ionomers; Monte Carlo methods; Polyaniline; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Charge transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35148825033

The operation of our protocol is based on the actual demands of the application, data traffic, and network dynamics.

Sec14p is normally essential. The essential requirement for SEC14 can be bypassed by inactivation of (i) the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis or (ii) KES1, which encodes an oxysterol binding protein. A unique screen was used to determine genome-wide genetic interactions for the essential gene SEC14 and to assess whether the two modes of ""sec14 bypass"" were similar or distinct. The results indicate that inactivation of the CDP-choline pathway allows cells with inactivated SEC14 to live through a mechanism distinct from that of inactivation of KES1.

Our goal was to determine if the SurgicalSIM laparoscopic surgical simulator can discriminate between novices and experts and to assess learning curves among novices. METHODS: Twenty novices and five experts performed five repetitions on the following modules: place arrow, retract, dissect, and traverse tube. For each module, median baseline performance was calculated. Novices performed 35 additional repetitions to assess learning with practice. RESULTS: Experts outperformed novices at baseline for time to completion on the dissect, place arrow, and traverse tube modules, as well as for error frequency on the traverse tube and retract modules. Novices' performance improved significantly with practice, approaching the experts' baseline in all modules. CONCLUSION: The SurgicalSIM laparoscopic simulator exhibits construct validity on three of four basic-skills modules when considering completion time and on two modules when considering error frequency. Among novices, learning occurred with additional repetitions.

Coregulation and coordinated horizontal gene transfer are believed to promote the proximity of functionally related genes and the formation of operons. However, forces that influence the structure of the genome beyond the level of a single operon remain unknown. Here, we show that the biophysical mechanism by which regulatory proteins search for their sites on DNA can impose constraints on genome structure. Using simulations, we demonstrate that rapid and reliable gene regulation requires that the transcription factor (TF) gene be close to the site on DNA the TF has to bind, thus promoting the colocalization of TF genes and their targets on the genome. We use parameters that have been measured in recent experiments to estimate the relevant length and times scales of this process and demonstrate that the search for a cognate site may be prohibitively slow if a TF has a low copy number and is not colocalized. We also analyze TFs and their sites in a number of bacterial genomes, confirm that they are colocalized significantly more often than expected, and show that this observation cannot be attributed to the pressure for coregulation or formation of selfish gene clusters, thus supporting the role of the biophysical constraint in shaping the structure of prokaryotic genomes.

The magnitude of shifts between free and bound concentrations of their immediate and more distant neighbors in the network is influenced by such factors as the network topology, the distribution of protein concentrations among its nodes, and the average binding strength. Our primary conclusion is that, on average, the effects of a perturbation are strongly localized and exponentially decay with the network distance away from the perturbed node, which explains why, despite globally connected topology, individual functional modules in such networks are able to operate fairly independently. We also found that under specific favorable conditions, realized in a significant number of paths in the yeast network, concentration perturbations can selectively propagate over considerable network distances (up to four steps). Such ""action-at-a-distance"" requires high concentrations of heterodimers along the path as well as low free (unbound) concentration of intermediate proteins. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Binding equilibrium; Dissociation constant; Genetic interactions; Law of mass action; Small-world networks","fungal protein; RNA; protein; algorithm; article; binding affinity; crystal structure; dissociation constant; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; mass spectrometry; microarray analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein database; protein protein interaction; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Western blotting; yeast; computer simulation; metabolism; protein binding; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Computer Simulation; Protein Binding; Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348813628

Adaptive optics systems allow the effects of turbulence-induced aberrations to be reduced for a narrow field of view corresponding approximately to the isoplanatic angle θ0.

We present a technique to estimate the PSF of an adaptive optics telescope as function of the field angle, and use this information in a space-varying image reconstruction technique. Simulated anisoplanatic intensity images of a star field are reconstructed by means of a block-processing method using the predicted local PSF. Two methods for image recovery are used: matrix inversion with Tikhonov regularization, and the Lucy-Richardson algorithm. Image reconstruction results obtained using the space-varying predicted PSF are compared to space invariant deconvolution results obtained using the on-axis PSF.

Subject-drivers searched for passengers, and then attempted to take the most efficient route to the requested destinations (one of several target stores). Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects rapidly learn to find direct paths from random pickup locations to target stores. Experiment 2 varied the degree to which landmark and layout cues were preserved across two successively learned towns. When spatial layout was preserved, transfer was low if only target stores were altered, and high if both target stores and surrounding buildings were altered, even though in the latter case all local views were changed. This suggests that subjects can rapidly acquire a survey representation based on the spatial layout of the town and independent of local views, but that subjects will rely on local views when present, and are harmed when associations between previously learned landmarks are disrupted.

Here we describe a ""multi-constraint"" protein design protocol to predict sequences optimized for multiple criteria, such as maintaining sets of interactions, and apply it to characterize the mechanism and extent to which 20 multi-specific proteins are constrained by binding to multiple partners. We find that multi-specific binding is accommodated by at least two distinct patterns. In the simplest case, all partners share key interactions, and sequences optimized for binding to either single or multiple partners recover only a subset of native amino acid residues as optimal. More interestingly, for signaling interfaces functioning as network ""hubs,"" we identify a different, ""multi-faceted"" mode, where each binding partner prefers its own subset of wild-type residues within the promiscuous binding site. Here, integration of preferences across all partners results in sequences much more ""native-like"" than seen in optimization for any single binding partner alone, suggesting these interfaces are substantially optimized for multi-specificity. The two strategies make distinct predictions for interface evolution and design. Shared interfaces may be better small molecule targets, whereas multi-faceted interactions may be more ""designable"" for altered specificity patterns. The computational methodology presented here is generalizable for examining how naturally occurring protein sequences have been selected to satisfy a variety of positive and negative constraints, as well as for rationally designing proteins to have desired patterns of altered specificity. © 2007 Humphris and Kortemme.",,"Ran protein; protein; amino acid sequence; article; mathematical computing; molecule; prediction; protein binding; protein interaction; protein targeting; scoring system; signal transduction; simulation; wild type; binding site; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug design; metabolism; methodology; physiology; protein analysis; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; signal transduction; Binding Sites; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Design; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548383489

The Longevity Gene Study was initiated in 1998 at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to investigate longevity genes in a selected population: the ""oldest old"" Ashkenazi Jews, 95 years of age and older, and their children. The study proved the principle that some of these subjects are endowed with longevity-promoting genotypes. Here we reason that some of the favorable genotypes act as mechanisms that buffer the deleterious effect of age-related disease genes. As a result, the frequency of deleterious genotypes may increase among individuals with extreme lifespan because their protective genotype allows disease-related genes to accumulate. Thus, studies of genotypic frequencies among different age groups can elucidate the genetic determinants and pathways responsible for longevity. Borrowing from evolutionary theory, we present arguments regarding the differential survival via buffering mechanisms and their target age-related disease genes in searching for aging and longevity genes. Using more than 1,200 subjects between the sixth and eleventh decades of life (at least 140 subjects in each group), we corroborate our hypotheses experimentally. We study 66 common allelic site polymorphism in 36 candidate genes on the basis of their phenotype. Among them we have identified a candidate-buffering mechanism and its candidate age-related disease gene target. Previously, the beneficial effect of an advantageous cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP-VV) genotype on lipoprotein particle size in association with decreased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, as well as with better cognitive function, have been demonstrated. We report an additional advantageous effect of the CETP-VV (favorable) genotype in neutralizing the deleterious effects of the lipoprotein(a) (LPA) gene. Finally, using literature-based interaction discovery methods, we use the set of longevity genes, buffering genes, and their age-related target disease genes to construct the underlying subnetwork of interacting genes that is expected to be responsible for longevity. Genome wide, high-throughput hypothesis-free analyses are currently being utilized to elucidate unknown genetic pathways in many model organisms, linking observed phenotypes to their underlying genetic mechanisms. The longevity phenotype and its genetic mechanisms, such as our buffering hypothesis, are similar; thus, the experimental corroboration of our hypothesis provides a proof of concept for the utility of high-throughput methods for elucidating such mechanisms. It also provides a framework for developing strategies to prevent some age-related diseases by intervention at the appropriate level. © 2007 Bergman et al.",,"cholesterol ester transfer protein; lipoprotein A; adult; aged; aging; allele; article; cardiovascular disease; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; evolution; female; gene frequency; gene identification; gene interaction; gene targeting; genetic analysis; genetic polymorphism; genotype; human; lifespan; longevity; male; metabolic disorder; particle size; phenotype; survival rate; biological model; computer simulation; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; longevity; population genetics; Aging; Computer Simulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Humans; Longevity; Models, Genetic; Survival Rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548442083

The use of human expression data compendia for discovery of such programs presents several challenges including cellular inhomogeneity within samples, genetic and environmental variation across samples, uncertainty in the numbers of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. We developed GeneProgram, a new unsupervised computational framework based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes that addresses each of the above challenges. GeneProgram uses expression data to simultaneously organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior, to produce maps of expression programs, which are sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, we showed that GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. We applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, a substantial number of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors in genome-wide experiments. Further, GeneProgram discovered expression programs that appear to implicate surprising signaling pathways or receptor types in the response to infection, including Wnt signaling and neurotransmitter receptors. We believe the discovered map of expression programs involved in the response to infection will be useful for guiding future biological experiments; genes from programs with low generality scores might serve as new drug targets that exhibit minimal ""cross-talk,"" and genes from high generality programs may maintain common physiological responses that go awry in disease states. Further, our method is multipurpose, and can be applied readily to novel compendia of biological data. © 2007 Gerber et al.",,"immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; neurotransmitter receptor; transcription factor; Wnt protein; proteome; article; Bayes theorem; biology; data analysis; DNA microarray; gene expression; gene mapping; host cell; human; immunomodulation; infection; machine learning; molecule; nonhuman; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer program; computer simulation; gene expression profiling; metabolism; methodology; multigene family; physiology; signal transduction; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Models, Biological; Multigene Family; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Proteome; Signal Transduction; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548409607

This phenomenon has been termed mental rotation. While there is widespread agreement that parietal cortex plays a dominant role in mental rotation, reports concerning the involvement of motor areas are less consistent. From a theoretical point of view, activation in motor areas suggests that mental rotation relies upon visuo-motor rather than visuo-spatial processing alone. However, the type of information that is processed by motor areas during mental rotation remains unclear. In this study we used event-related fMRI to assess whether activation in parietal and dorsolateral premotor areas (dPM) during mental rotation is distinctively related to processing spatial orientation information. Using a newly developed task paradigm we explicitly separated the processing steps (encoding, mental rotation proper and object matching) required by mental rotation tasks and additionally modulated the amount of spatial orientation information that had to be processed. Our results show that activation in dPM during mental rotation is not strongly modulated by the processing of spatial orientation information, and that activation in dPM areas is strongest during mental rotation proper. The latter finding suggests that dPM is involved in more generalized processes such as visuo-spatial attention and movement anticipation. We propose that solving mental rotation tasks is heavily dependent upon visuo-motor processes and evokes neural processing that may be considered as an implicit simulation of actual object rotation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In an experiment concerning learners' transfer performance and mental effort, the simulation presented the three strategies to three groups of learners and measured their performance on the transfer tasks. In this experiment, conventional problem solving was contrasted with two worked example strategies. The results indicated a significant difference between practicing problem solving and using worked examples. Learners who practiced problem solving in an interactive simulation outperformed the learners who studied computer-based worked examples. They also invested lower mental effort in transfer tasks. When accounting for the difference in the learners' domain knowledge, the strategies were not significantly different among the more experienced learners. For the less experienced learners, those who practiced problem solving significantly outperformed their worked example counterparts. Among all participants and also among less experienced learners the problem solving group invested significantly lower mental effort in the performance of transfer tasks.

This actomyosin binding depends upon myofilament geometry, kinetics of thin-filament Ca2+ activation, and kinetics of cross-bridge cycling. Binding occurs within a compliant network of protein filaments where there is mechanical coupling between myosins along the thick-filament backbone and between actin monomers along the thin filament. Such mechanical coupling precludes using ordinary differential equation models when examining the effects of lattice geometry, kinetics, or compliance on force production. This study uses two stochastically driven, spatially explicit models to predict levels of cross-bridge binding, force, thin-filament Ca2+ activation, and ATP utilization. One model incorporates the 2-to-1 ratio of thin to thick filaments of vertebrate striated muscle (multi-filament model), while the other comprises only one thick and one thin filament (two-filament model). Simulations comparing these models show that the multi-filament predictions of force, fractional cross-bridge binding, and cross-bridge turnover are more consistent with published experimental values. Furthermore, the values predicted by the multi-filament model are greater than those values predicted by the two-filament model. These increases are larger than the relative increase of potential inter-filament interactions in the multi-filament model versus the two-filament model. This amplification of coordinated cross-bridge binding and cycling indicates a mechanism of cooperativity that depends on sarcomere lattice geometry, specifically the ratio and arrangement of myofilaments. © 2007 Tanner et al.",,"calcium; actin; adenosine triphosphate; multiprotein complex; myosin; tropomyosin; troponin; actin myosin interaction; article; calcium cell level; calcium signaling; cell interaction; computer model; computer prediction; computer simulation; muscle contractility; muscle force; muscle function; myofilament; sarcomere; stochastic model; thin filament; biological model; chemistry; elasticity; energy transfer; kinetics; metabolism; Monte Carlo method; movement (physiology); muscle contraction; muscle strength; physiology; protein binding; quantitative structure activity relation; skeletal muscle; ultrastructure; Vertebrata; Actins; Adenosine Triphosphate; Calcium Signaling; Computer Simulation; Elasticity; Energy Transfer; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Monte Carlo Method; Movement; Multiprotein Complexes; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Myosins; Protein Binding; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Sarcomeres; Tropomyosin; Troponin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547597323

After reducing the model to an appropriate nondimensionalized form featuring one fast and two slow variables, we use geometric singular perturbation theory to analyze the model's dynamics under systematic variation of the parameters τ h , τ n , and applied current I. As expected, we find that for fixed (τ h , τ n ), the model undergoes a transition from excitable, with a stable resting equilibrium state, to oscillatory, featuring classical relaxation oscillations, as I increases. Interestingly, mixed-mode oscillations (MMO's), featuring slow action potential generation, arise for an intermediate range of I values, if τ h or τ n is sufficiently large. Our analysis explains in detail the geometric mechanisms underlying these results, which depend crucially on the presence of two slow variables, and allows for the quantitative estimation of transitional parameter values, in the singular limit. In particular, we show that the subthreshold oscillations in the observed MMO patterns arise through a generalized canard phenomenon. Finally, we discuss the relation of results obtained in the singular limit to the behavior observed away from, but near, this limit. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,"Approximation theory; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Perturbation techniques; Three dimensional; Geometric mechanisms; Hodgkin-Huxley models; Mixed-mode oscillations (MMO); Systematic variations; Cybernetics; Cephalopoda; action potential; animal; article; biological model; biological rhythm; cephalopod; computer simulation; nerve cell; nonlinear system; physiology; Action Potentials; Animals; Biological Clocks; Computer Simulation; Decapodiformes; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Nonlinear Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547379404

Extending such annotations to pathways is a critical component of functional characterization of cellular signaling at the systems level. Results: We propose a framework for projecting gene regulatory networks onto the space of functional attributes using multigraph models, with the objective of deriving statistically significant pathway annotations. We first demonstrate that annotations of pairwise interactions do not generalize to indirect relationships between processes. Motivated by this result, we formalize the problem of identifying statistically overrepresented pathways of functional attributes. We establish the hardness of this problem by demonstrating the non-monotonicity of common statistical significance measures. We propose a statistical model that emphasizes the modularity of a pathway, evaluating its significance based on the coupling of its building blocks. We complement the statistical model by an efficient algorithm and software, Narada, for computing significant pathways in large regulatory networks. Comprehensive results from our methods applied to the Escherichia coli transcription network demonstrate that our approach is effective in identifying known, as well as novel biological pathway annotations. © 2007 The Author(s).",,"algorithm; bacterial genetics; bioinformatics; computer program; conference paper; controlled study; Escherichia coli; genetic transcription; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; statistical model; statistical significance; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Documentation; Gene Expression Regulation; Models, Biological; Proteome; Signal Transduction; Software; Escherichia coli",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547840240

Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Functional MRI; Graph theory; Neuroanatomy; Synchrony","algorithm; article; brain cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Macaca; neocortex; neuroanatomy; nonhuman; parietal lobe; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; time; animal; biological model; biology; histology; motor cortex; nerve cell network; nerve tract; physiology; somatosensory cortex; visual cortex; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Computational Biology; Macaca; Models, Neurological; Motor Cortex; Neocortex; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Somatosensory Cortex; Time Factors; Visual Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547219105

Background: Prior literature has consistently found that users of immersive VEs underestimate distances by approximately 50%. Method: In each of the two experiments, 16 participants viewed objects in an immersive VE and estimated their distance to them by means of blindfolded walking tasks before and after interacting with the VE. Results: The interaction task significantly corrected users' underestimation bias to nearly veridical. Differences between pre- and postinteraction mean distance estimation accuracy were large (d = 4.63), and significant (p < .001), and they generalized across response task. Conclusion: This finding limits the generality of the underestimation effect in VEs and suggests that distance underestimation in VEs may not be a roadblock to the development of VE applications. Application: Potential or actual applications of this research include the improvement of VE systems requiring accurate spatial awareness. Copyright © 2007, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) seem to be particularly suitable for inferring relationships between cellular variables from the analysis of time series measurements of mRNA or protein concentrations. As evaluating inference results on a real dataset is controversial, the use of simulated data has been proposed. However, DBN approaches that use continuous variables, thus avoiding the information loss associated with discretization, have not yet been extensively assessed, and most of the proposed approaches have dealt with linear Gaussian models. Results: We propose a generalization of dynamic Gaussian networks to accommodate nonlinear dependencies between variables. As a benchmark dataset to test the new approach, we used data from a mathematical model of cell cycle control in budding yeast that realistically reproduces the complexity of a cellular system. We evaluated the ability of the networks to describe the dynamics of cellular systems and their precision in reconstructing the true underlying causal relationships between variables. We also tested the robustness of the results by analyzing the effect of noise on the data, and the impact of a different sampling time. Conclusion: The results confirmed that DBNs with Gaussian models can be effectively exploited for a first level analysis of data from complex cellular systems. The inferred models are parsimonious and have a satisfying goodness of fit. Furthermore, the networks not only offer a phenomenological description of the dynamics of cellular systems, but are also able to suggest hypotheses concerning the causal interactions between variables. The proposed nonlinear generalization of Gaussian models yielded models characterized by a slightly lower goodness of fit than the linear model, but a better ability to recover the true underlying connections between variables. © 2007 Ferrazzi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Complex cellular systems; Continuous variables; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Linear Gaussian model; Nonlinear dependencies; Nonlinear generalizations; Phenomenological description; Protein concentrations; Bayesian networks; Cellular arrays; Cellular telephone systems; Gaussian distribution; Mathematical models; Reverse engineering; Statistical tests; Complex networks; accuracy; article; Bayes theorem; biological model; budding; cell cycle regulation; controlled study; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nonhuman; nonlinear system; normal distribution; reverse engineer cellular system; sensitivity analysis; simulation; statistical model; yeast; biological model; cell cycle; computer simulation; cytology; normal distribution; physiology; Saccharomyces; validation study; Saccharomycetales; Bayes Theorem; Cell Cycle; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Normal Distribution; Saccharomycetales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547788797

This limiting distribution allows for the analytical calculation of the system's probability of firing in response to each input, the expected number of response failures between firings, and the distribution of slow variable values between firings. Moreover, using this approach, it is possible to understand why the system will not have a stationary distribution and why Monte Carlo simulations do not converge under certain conditions. The analytical calculations involved can be performed whenever the distribution of interexcitation intervals and the recovery dynamics of the slow variable are known. The method can be extended to other models that feature a single variable that builds up to a threshold where an instantaneous spike and reset occur. We also discuss how the Markov chain analysis generalizes to any pair of input trains, excitatory or inhibitory and synaptic or not, such that the frequencies of the two trains are sufficiently different from each other. We illustrate this analysis on a model thalamocortical (TC) cell subject to two example distributions of excitatory synaptic inputs in the cases of constant and rhythmic inhibition. The analysis shows a drastic drop in the likelihood of firing just after inhibitory onset in the case of rhythmic inhibition, relative even to the case of elevated but constant inhibition.

An initial temperature response of a tissue to an ultrashort pulse irradiation is analyzed by the volume-average method in combination with the transient discrete ordinates method for modeling the ultrafast radiation heat transfer. This response is found to reach pseudo steady state within 1 ns for the considered tissues. The single pulse result is then utilized to obtain the temperature response to pulse train irradiation at the microsecond/millisecond time scales. After that, the temperature field is predicted by the hyperbolic heat conduction model which is solved by the MacCormack's scheme with error terms correction. Finally, the hyperbolic conduction is compared with the traditional parabolic heat diffusion model. It is found that the maximum local temperatures are larger in the hyperbolic prediction than the parabolic prediction. In the modeled dermis tissue, a 7% non-dimensional temperature increase is found.

In a recent study with a fixed-base driving simulator, drivers failed to execute the return phase of a lane change when steering without vision, resulting in systematic final heading errors biased in the direction of the lane change. Here we challenge the generality of that finding. Suppose that, when asked to perform a lane (position) change, drivers fail to recognize that a heading change is required to make a lateral position change. However, given an explicit path, the necessary heading changes become apparent. Here we demonstrate that when heading requirements are made explicit, drivers appropriately implement the return phase. More importantly, by using an electric vehicle outfitted with a portable virtual reality system, we also show that valid inertial information (i.e., vestibular and somatosensory cues) enables accurate steering behavior when vision is absent. Thus, the failure to properly execute a lane change in a driving simulator without a moving base does not present a fundamental problem for feed-forward driving behavior. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Locomotion; Motor control; Steering; Vestibular; Vision","adult; article; association; clinical article; driver; driving ability; female; human; human experiment; male; motor performance; motor vehicle; positive feedback; priority journal; somatosensory stimulation; vestibular function; virtual reality; visual adaptation; Adolescent; Adult; Automobile Driving; Computer Simulation; Cues; Feedback; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Vestibule, Labyrinth; Vision; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947322345

Previous research suggests that there is a different developmental schedule for adaptation at the kinematic compared to the neuro-muscular level. The purpose of this study was to determine how age-related differences in neuro-muscular organization affect the mechanical construction of pedaling at different levels of the task. By quantifying the flow of segmental energy caused by muscles, we determined the muscular synergies that construct the movement outcome across movement speeds. Younger children (5-7 years; n = 11), older children (8-10 years; n = 8), and adults (22-31 years; n = 8) rode a stationary ergometer at five discrete cadences (60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 rpm) at 10% of their individually predicted peak power output. Using a forward dynamics simulation, we determined the muscular contributions to crank power, as well as muscular power delivered to the crank directly and indirectly (through energy absorption and transfer) during the downstroke and the upstroke of the crank cycle. We found significant age × cadence interactions for (1) peak muscular power at the hip joint [Wilks' Lambda = 0.441, F(8,42) = 2.65, p = 0.019] indicating that at high movement speeds children produced less peak power at the hip than adults, (2) muscular power delivered to the crank during the downstroke and the upstroke of the crank cycle [Wilks' Lambda = 0.399, F(8,42) = 3.07, p = 0.009] indicating that children delivered a greater proportion of the power to the crank during the upstroke when compared to adults, (3) hip power contribution to limb power [Wilks' Lambda = 0.454, F(8,42) = 2.54, p = 0.023] indicating a cadence-dependence of age-related differences in the muscular synergy between hip extensors and plantarflexors. The results demonstrate that in spite of a successful performance, children construct the task of pedaling differently when compared to adults, especially when they are pushed to their performance limits. The weaker synergy between hip extensors and plantarflexors suggests that a lack of inter-muscular coordination, rather than muscular power production per se, is a factor that limits children's performance ranges. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Adults; Biomechanics; Children; Cycling; Development; Dynamics; Muscle; Synergy","adaptation; adult; age distribution; article; biomechanics; child; childhood; controlled study; energy transfer; extensor muscle; flexor muscle; hip; human; human experiment; motor coordination; motor performance; muscle function; muscle strength; neuromuscular function; normal human; plantaris muscle; priority journal; simulation; task performance; velocity; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Age Factors; Aging; Algorithms; Bicycling; Biomechanics; Child; Child, Preschool; Energy Transfer; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Muscle, Skeletal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847167488

Generally, protein concentrations depend on the translation rate (which is proportional to the translational activity, TA) and the degradation rate. By integrating 12 publicly available large-scale datasets and additional database information of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we systematically analyzed five factors contributing to TA: mRNA concentration, ribosome density, ribosome occupancy, the codon adaptation index, and a newly developed ""tRNA adaptation index."" Our analysis of the functional relationship between the TA and measured protein concentrations suggests that the TA follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The calculated TA, together with measured protein concentrations, allowed us to estimate degradation rates for 4,125 proteins under standard conditions. A significant correlation to recently published degradation rates supports our approach. Moreover, based on a newly developed scoring system, we identified and analyzed genes subjected to the posttranscriptional regulation mechanism, translation on demand. Next we applied these findings to publicly available data of protein and mRNA concentrations under four stress conditions. The integration of these measurements allowed us to compare the condition-specific responses at the posttranscriptional level. Our analysis of all 62 proteins that have been measured under all four conditions revealed proteins with very specific posttranscriptional stress response, in contrast to more generic responders, which were nonspecifically regulated under several conditions. The concept of specific and generic responders is known for transcriptional regulation. Here we show that it also holds true at the posttranscriptional level. © 2007 Brockmann et al.",,"messenger RNA; transfer RNA; proteome; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; article; codon; data base; Michaelis Menten kinetics; open reading frame; protein degradation; protein expression; protein processing; regulatory mechanism; ribosome; RNA degradation; RNA translation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; translation regulation; biological model; computer simulation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiology; protein processing; RNA processing; transcription initiation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Models, Biological; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteome; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcriptional Activation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047223024

Variation of the durations of the FI and the non-reinforced probe trials showed it to be dependent on the time when reinforcement is expected.

We propose the concept of dependence network, apply it for identifying cancer biomarkers, and study the difference between the protein or gene samples from cancer and non-cancer subjects based on mass-spectrometry (MS) and microarray data. Results: Three MS and two gene microarray datasets are studied. Clear differences are observed in the dependence networks for cancer and non-cancer samples. Protein/gene features are examined three at one time through an exhaustive search. Dependence networks are constructed by binding triples identified by the eigenvalue pattern of the dependence model, and are further compared to identify cancer biomarkers. Such dependence-network-based biomarkers show much greater consistency under 10-fold cross-validation than the classification-performance-based biomarkers. Furthermore, the biological relevance of the dependence-network-based biomarkers using microarray data is discussed.

Neighborhood analysis methods for network data are important in systems biology. If individual network connections are susceptible to noise, it can be advantageous to define neighborhoods on the basis of a robust interconnectedness measure, e.g. the topological overlap measure. Since the use of multiple nodes in the seed set may lead to more informative neighborhoods, it can be advantageous to define multi-node similarity measures. Results: The pairwise topological overlap measure is generalized to multiple network nodes and subsequently used in a recursive neighborhood construction method. A local permutation scheme is used to determine the neighborhood size. Using four network applications and a simulated example, we provide empirical evidence that the resulting neighborhoods are biologically meaningful, e.g. we use neighborhood analysis to identify brain cancer related genes. © 2007 Oxford University Press.",,"cell cycle protein; protein EZH 2; protein KIF 14; protein TOP2 A; protein TPX 2; Rac1 protein; tumor protein; unclassified drug; algorithm; article; brain cancer; data analysis; data analysis software; Drosophila; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genomics; human; mathematical analysis; MEDLINE; open reading frame; priority journal; protein database; protein protein interaction; survival time; tumor gene; Algorithms; Brain Neoplasms; Computer Simulation; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Signal Transduction; Tumor Markers, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846705486

The new AISD-based TCP protocol produces smooth transfer rates and performs the flow and congestion control functions of TCP. As a result, it is suitable for streaming applications and solves the unfairness problem that occurs when TCP and UDP share the same bottleneck link. The AISD strategy is very simple to implement, only modifies the multiplicative part of the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease strategy of TCP, and can be implemented in any TCP version. The smooth part of the strategy is implemented using a low pass filter that considers history in the calculation of the congestion window. The modeling of this new strategy raises new challenges compared to the classical TCP modeling in two ways: first, it needs to be adapted to a more complex dynamism of the congestion window, and second, the model needs to incorporate a scheduler that periodically updates the value of the congestion window. The model is progressively built to finally characterize the steady-state send rate and throughput of a flow as a function of the loss probability, the round-trip time (RTT), the time-out interval, and the scheduler interval. The performance of this AISD-based TCP is compared analytically and experimentally with TCP Reno, and its superior performance is demonstrated. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, higher resolution of fiber directions comes at the cost of higher susceptibility to noise. In this study, we describe the use of linear regularization of the fiber orientation distribution function by Damped Singular Value Decomposition. Furthermore, the degree of regularization is optimized on a voxel-by-voxel basis with no user interaction using Generalized Cross Validation. We find, by simulations, that regularization can improve the reliability of fiber orientation determination when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Simulations and in vivo measurements indicate that spurious peaks of the fiber orientation distribution function in regions with low anisotropy largely disappear when regularization is introduced. The methods examined are fast enough to be used on a routine basis with diffusion MRI data sets and may improve estimation of water diffusion properties in heterogeneous white matter and boost reliability of fiber tracking through regions of brain with complex fiber geometry. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We have added new features to our dynamic clamp software StdpC (""Spike timing-dependent plasticity Clamp"") allowing such new applications while conserving the ease of use and installation of the popular earlier Dynclamp 2/4 package. Here, we introduce the new features of a waveform generator, freely programmable Hodgkin-Huxley conductances, learning synapses, graphic data displays, and a powerful scripting mechanism and discuss examples of experiments using these features. In the first example we built and 'voltage clamped' a conductance based model cell from a passive resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit using the dynamic clamp software to generate the voltage-dependent currents. In the second example we coupled our new spike generator through a burst detection/burst generation mechanism in a phase-dependent way to a neuron in a central pattern generator and dissected the subtle interaction between neurons, which seems to implement an information transfer through intraburst spike patterns. In the third example, making use of the new plasticity mechanism for simulated synapses, we analyzed the effect of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) on synchronization revealing considerable enhancement of the entrainment of a post-synaptic neuron by a periodic spike train. These examples illustrate that with modern dynamic clamp software like StdpC, the dynamic clamp has developed beyond the mere introduction of artificial synapses or ionic conductances into neurons to a universal research tool, which might well become a standard instrument of modern electrophysiology. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, experimental noise in both data types combined with environmental dependence and uncorrelation between binding and regulation in ChIP-chip binding data complicate analyses that utilize these complimentary data sources. Therefore, to minimize the impact of these inaccuracies on transcription analyses it is desirable to identify instances of gene expression-ChIP-chip agreement, under the premise that inaccuracies are less likely to be present when separate data sources corroborate each other. Current methods for such identification either make key assumptions that limit their applicability and/or yield high false positive and false negative rates. The goal of this work was to develop a method with a minimal amount of assumptions, and thus widely applicable, that can identify agreement between gene expression and ChIP-chip data at a higher confidence level than current methods. Results: We demonstrate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that currently available ChIP-chip binding data explain microarray data from a variety of environments only as well as randomized networks with the same connectivity density. This suggests a high degree of inconsistency between the two data types and illustrates the need for a method that can identify consistency between the two data sources. Here we have developed a Gibbs sampling technique to identify genes whose expression and ChIP-chip binding data are mutually consistent. Compared to current methods that could perform the same task, the Gibbs sampling method developed here exceeds their ability at high levels (>50%) of transcription network and gene expression error, while performing similarly at lower levels. Using this technique, we show that on average 73% more gene expression features can be captured per gene as compared to the unfiltered use of gene expression and ChIP-chip-derived network connectivity data. It is important to note that the method described here can be generalized to other transcription connectivity data (e.g. sequence analysis, etc.). © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"accuracy; analytical error; article; bacterial genetics; bioinformatics; gene expression; gene identification; intermethod comparison; microarray analysis; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence analysis; statistical analysis; transcription regulation; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Gene Expression Profiling; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Protein Interaction Mapping; Reproducibility of Results; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Sample Size; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845365903

In particular, the ENCODE project requires the consistent segmentation of many different tiling array datasets into 'active regions' (e.g. finding transfrags from transcriptional data and putative binding sites from ChIP-chip experiments). Previously, such segmentation was done in an unsupervised fashion mainly based on characteristics of the signal distribution in the tiling array data itself. Here we propose a supervised framework for doing this. It has the advantage of explicitly incorporating validated biological knowledge into the model and allowing for formal training and testing. Methodology: In particular, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework, which is capable of explicitly modeling the dependency between neighboring probes and whose extended version (the generalized HMM) also allows explicit description of state duration density. We introduce a formal definition of the tiling-array analysis problem, and explain how we can use this to describe sampling small genomic regions for experimental validation to build up a gold-standard set for training and testing. We then describe various ideal and practical sampling strategies (e.g. maximizing signal entropy within a selected region versus using gene annotation or known promoters as positives for transcription or ChIP-chip data, respectively). Results: For the practical sampling and training strategies, we show how the size and noise in the validated training data affects the performance of an HMM applied to the ENCODE transcriptional and ChIP-chip experiments. In particular, we show that the HMM framework is able to efficiently process tiling array data as well as or better than previous approaches. For the idealized sampling strategies, we show how we can assess their performance in a simulation framework and how a maximum entropy approach, which samples sub-regions with very different signal intensities, gives the maximally performing gold-standard. This latter result has strong implications for the optimum way medium-scale validation experiments should be carried out to verify the results of the genome-scale tiling array experiments. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"article; bioinformatics; data analysis; DNA sequence; entropy; genetic transcription; genome analysis; genomics; intermethod comparison; microarray analysis; priority journal; probability; promoter region; roc curve; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; validation process; Artificial Intelligence; Biology; Chromosome Mapping; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Information Storage and Retrieval; Markov Chains; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845369532

Previous studies have shown the impact of the vertical distribution of scatterers on the reflectance ratio. The reflectance ratio is defined as the ratio of the reflectance in a first spectral band, strongly attenuated by O2 absorption, to the reflectance in a second spectral band, minimally attenuated. First, a sensitivity study is performed to quantify the expected accuracy for various aerosol loadings and models. An accurate, high spectral resolution, radiative transfer model that fully accounts for interactions between scattering and absorption is used in the simulations. Due to their adequate spectral characteristics, POLDER and MERIS instruments are considered for simulations. For a moderately loaded atmosphere (i.e., aerosol optical thickness of 0.3 at 760 nm), the expected error on aerosol altitude is about 0.3 km for MERIS and 0.7 km for POLDER. More accurate estimates are obtained with MERIS, since the spectral reflectance ratio is more sensitive. Second, the methodology is applied to MERIS and POLDER imagery. Estimates of aerosol altitude are compared with lidar profiles of backscattering coefficient acquired during the AOPEX-2004 experiment. Retrievals are consistent with measurements and theory. These comparisons demonstrate the potential of the differential absorption methodology for obtaining information on aerosol vertical distribution.","Aerosol altitude; Atmospheric correction; Ocean color; Scattering and absorption interactions","Absorption; Computer simulation; Imaging systems; Mathematical models; Reflection; Aerosol altitude; Atmospheric correction; Ocean colors; Scattering and absorption interactions; Aerosols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847001285

In disc degeneration the normal transfer of load between disc substructures is compromised. The objective of this study was to explore the mechanical role of the nucleus pulposus in support of axial compressive loads over time. This was achieved by measuring the elastic slow ramp and viscoelastic stress-relaxation mechanical behaviors of cadaveric sheep motion segments before and after partial nucleotomy through the endplate (keeping the annulus fibrosus intact). Mechanics were evaluated at five conditions: Intact, intact after 10,000 cycles of compression, acutely after nucleotomy, following nucleotomy and 10,000 cycles of compression, and following unloaded recovery. Radiographs and magnetic resonance images were obtained to examine structure. Only the short time constant of the stress relaxation was altered due to nucleotomy. In contrast, cyclic loading resulted in significant and large changes to both the stiffness and stress relaxation behaviors. Moreover, the nucleotomy had little to no effect on the disc mechanics after cyclic loading, as there were no significant differences comparing mechanics after cyclic loading with or without the nucleotomy. Following unloaded recovery the mechanical changes that had occurred as a consequence of cyclic loading were restored, leaving only a sustained change in the short time constant due to the trans-endplate nucleotomy. Thus the swelling and redistribution of the remaining nucleus pulposus was not able to fully restore mechanical behaviors. This study reveals insights into the role of the nucleus pulposus in disc function, and provides new information toward the potential role of altered nucleus pulpous function in the degenerative cascade.

The method is based in the in situ adaptive tabulation method that has been successfully applied in the field of combustion chemistry, but is significantly modified to better handle the system of equations in plasticity. When using the database, the material response is estimated by a linear extrapolation from an appropriate database entry. This is shown to provide a response with an acceptable error tolerance. Two different example problems are chosen to demonstrate the behavior of the constitutive model estimation technique: a dynamic shock simulation, and a quasi-static inhomogeneous deformation simulation. This generalized in situ adaptive tabulation method shows promise for enabling simulations with complex multi-physics and multi-length scale constitutive descriptions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive tabulation; Constitutive models; Parameter estimation; Plasticity","Computer simulation; Deformation; Dynamics; Extrapolation; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Adaptive tabulation; Constitutive models; In situ adaptive tabulation; Linear extrapolation; Plasticity evaluation; Plasticity; Computer simulation; Deformation; Dynamics; Extrapolation; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Plasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846485598

Intraductal instillation of an RCAS vector carrying the polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) gene (RCAS-PyMT) induced multiple, oligoclonal tumors within 3 weeks in infected mammary glands of MMTV-tva transgenic mice. The rapid appearance of these tumors from a relatively small pool of infected cells (estimated to be ≈2 × 103 cells per gland by infection with RCAS carrying a GFP gene; RCAS-GF0P) was accompanied by a high fraction of cells positive for Ki67, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc, implying strong proliferation competence. Furthermore, the tumors displayed greater cellular heterogeneity than did tumors arising in MMTV-PyMT mice, suggesting that RCAS-PyMT transforms a relatively immature cell type. Infection of mice transgenic for both MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-tva with RCAS virus carrying an activated Neu oncogene dramatically enhanced tumor formation over what is observed in uninfected bitransgenic animals.

However, the design of such systems is particularly challenging because of the large number of design variables, multiple operating configurations, and the need to coordinate different simulation tools (e.g. optical ray tracing, finite element analysis, dynamic simulations, etc.) during the design and optimization process. This paper presents a design methodology to facilitate the design and optimization of our novel Adaptive Scanning Optical Microscope (ASOM), which includes a fast steering mirror (FSM), a custom designed scanner lens, and a MEMS deformable mirror (DM) to effectively enlarge the field of view in optical microscopy. An ""all at once"" formulation of the optimization problem using a traditional construction of the merit function proved inadequate. Instead, our approach first partitions the design problem into manageable sub-problems and uses the Collaborative Optimization (CO) framework to coordinate the system wide optimization of the sub-problems while maintaining a physically consistent solution between the simulation codes. Next, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach by presenting two ASOM designs that were generated using this methodology. The first design is based on high fidelity simulations and the second lower cost version has been constructed and tested in our laboratory using a 32 actuator deformable mirror. We conclude by summarizing our experiences and discussing how the approach could be generalized to other optical system design challenges.","Adaptive optics; Microscopy; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO); Optical system design; Optimization","Adaptive Scanning Optical Microscope (ASOM); Deformable mirror (DM); Fast steering mirror (FSM); Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO); Optical system design; Adaptive optics; Computer simulation; Military applications; Optical design; Optical devices; Optical microscopy; Optimization; Microscopes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750436932

Because transferred genes perform many medically important functions, such as conferring antibiotic resistance, improved detection of horizontally transferred genes from sequence data would be an important advance. Existing sequence-based methods for detecting HGT focus on changes in nucleotide composition or on differences between gene and genome phylogenies; these methods have high error rates. Results: First, we introduce a new class of methods for detecting HGT based on the changes in nucleotide substitution rates that occur when a gene is transferred to a new organism. Our new methods discriminate simulated HGT events with an error rate up to 10 times lower than does GC content. Use of models that are not time-reversible is crucial for detecting HGT. Second, we show that using combinations of multiple predictors of HGT offers substantial improvements over using any single predictor, yielding as much as a factor of 18 improvement in performance (a maximum reduction in error rate from 38% to about 3%). Multiple predictors were combined by using the random forests machine learning algorithm to identify optimal classifiers that separate HGT from non-HGT trees. Conclusion: The new class of HGT-detection methods introduced here combines advantages of phylogenetic and compositional HGT-detection techniques. These new techniques offer order-of-magnitude improvements over compositional methods because they are better able to discriminate HGT from non-HGT trees under a wide range of simulated conditions. We also found that combining multiple measures of HGT is essential for detecting a wide range of HGT events. These novel indicators of horizontal transfer will be widely useful in detecting HGT events linked to the evolution of important bacterial traits, such as antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. © 2006 Hamady et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Antibiotic resistance; Class of methods; Compositional method; Horizontal gene transfer; Horizontal transfer; Nucleotide composition; Nucleotide substitution; Optimal classifiers; Antibiotics; Decision trees; Forestry; Gene transfer; Learning algorithms; Plants (botany); Genes; cytosine; guanine; nucleotide; antibiotic resistance; article; bacterial genome; bacterial virulence; bioinformatics; gene sequence; horizontal gene transfer; intermethod comparison; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; phylogeny; sensitivity and specificity; biological model; biology; chemistry; computer program; computer simulation; human; human genome; probability; procedures; reproducibility; theoretical model; Bacteria (microorganisms); Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genome, Human; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Genetic; Models, Theoretical; Nucleotides; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751399556

The proposed simulation engine utilizes a novel material property estimation technique that generates effective material properties at the microscopic level. The material property models were developed based on empirical analysis and the behavior extraction of standard test structures. A literature review is provided on the physical phenomena that govern the mechanical behavior of thin films materials. This survey indicates that the present day models operate under a wide range of assumptions that may not be applicable to the micro-world. Thus, this methodology is foreseen to be an essential tool for MEMS designers as it would develop empirical models that relate the loading parameters, material properties, and the geometry of the microstructures with its performance characteristics. This process involves learning the relationship between the above parameters using non-parametric learning algorithms such as radial basis function networks and genetic algorithms. The proposed simulation engine has a graphical user interface (GUI) which is very adaptable, flexible, and transparent. The GUI is able to encompass all parameters associated with the determination of the desired material property so as to create models that provide an accurate estimation of the desired property. This technique was verified by fabricating and simulating bilayer cantilevers consisting of aluminum and glass (TEOS oxide) in our previous work.

The Strehl ratio measures the normalized peak intensity of the PSF compared to that of an ideal PSF, i.e. aberration-free, through the system. One advantage of this metric is that it has been shown to be proportional to the rms wavefront error via the Marechel approximation. Thus, Strehl ratio measurements are used to determine the performance of the system. Measurement of the Strehl ratio is frequently problematic in the presence of noise as can be the peak determination for critically sampled data. We have looked at alternative metrics, in particular the S1 sharpness metric. This metric measures the compactness of the PSF by the normalized sum of the squared image intensity and therefore relates to the intensity variance of the image. Using simulated AO PSFs, we show that there is a unique relationship between S1 and the Strehl ratio and we can therefore relate it back to the rms wavefront error.","Adaptive optics; Image Sharpness; Strehl ratio; System performance","Adaptive optics; Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Error analysis; Metric system; Optical transfer function; Image Sharpness; Strehl ratio; System performance; Image quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749404986

However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serial-transfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth. © 2006 Lim et al.",,"glycoprotein; live vaccine; live vaccine; messenger RNA; virus protein; virus vaccine; animal cell; article; computer model; computer simulation; controlled study; gene expression; gene location; gene overexpression; gene rearrangement; genetic transcription; genotype phenotype correlation; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; RNA translation; Vesicular stomatitis virus; virogenesis; virus adsorption; virus assembly; virus attenuation; virus genome; virus infection; virus nucleocapsid; virus replication; animal; biological model; biology; biosynthesis; cell line; genetics; hamster; metabolism; mouse; physiology; promoter region; protein synthesis; Vesicular stomatitis virus; virus replication; RNA viruses; Vesicular stomatitis virus; Animals; Cell Line; Computational Biology; Cricetinae; Genome, Viral; Mice; Models, Biological; Nucleocapsid; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Messenger; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus; Viral Proteins; Viral Vaccines; Virus Replication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749350509

The ab initio probe selection method employed in tiling arrays is unbiased, and thus ensures consistent sampling across coding and non-coding regions of the genome. Tiling arrays are increasingly used in chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments (ChIP on chip). ChIP on chip facilitates the generation of genome-wide maps of in-vivo interactions between DNA-associated proteins including transcription factors and DNA. Analysis of the hybridization of an immunoprecipitated sample to a tiling array facilitates the identification of ChIP-enriched segments of the genome. These enriched segments are putative targets of antibody assayable regulatory elements. The enrichment response is not ubiquitous across the genome. Typically 5 to 10% of tiled probes manifest some significant enrichment. Depending upon the factor being studied, this response can drop to less than 1%. The detection and assessment of significance for interactions that emanate from non-canonical and/or un-annotated regions of the genome is especially challenging. This is the motivation behind the proposed algorithm. Results: We have proposed a novel rank and replicate statistics-based methodology for identifying and ascribing statistical confidence to regions of ChIP-enrichment. The algorithm is optimized for identification of sites that manifest low levels of enrichment but are true positives, as validated by alternative biochemical experiments. Although the method is described here in the context of ChIP on chip experiments, it can be generalized to any treatment-control experimental design. The results of the algorithm show a high degree of concordance with independent biochemical validation methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm have been characterized via quantitative PCR and independent computational approaches. Conclusion: The algorithm ranks all enrichment sites based on their intra-replicate ranks and inter-replicate rank consistency.

Practically, this results in a small (<50 ms) asynchrony in which the motor response leads the sensory event. Here we show that the perceived simultaneity in a coincidence-anticipation task (line crossing) is affected by changing the perceived simultaneity in a different task (pacing). In the pace task, human subjects were instructed to press a key in perfect synchrony with a red square flashed every second. In training sessions, feedback was provided by flashing a blue square with each key press, below the red square. There were two types of training pace sessions: one in which the feedback was provided with no delay, the other (adapting), in which the feedback was progressively delayed (up to 100 ms). Subjects' asynchrony was unchanged in the first case, but it was significantly increased in the pace task with delay. In the coincidence-anticipation task, a horizontally moving vertical bar crossed a vertical line in the middle of a screen. Subjects were instructed to press a key exactly when the bar crossed the line. They were given no feedback on their performance. Asynchrony on the line-crossing task was tested after the training pace task with feedback. We found that this asynchrony to be significantly increased even though there never was any feedback on the coincidence-anticipation task itself. Subjects were not aware that their sensorimotor asynchrony had been lengthened (sometimes doubled). We conclude that perception of simultaneity in a sensorimotor task is learned. If this perception is caused by coincidence of signals in the brain, the timing of these signals depends on something-acquired by experience-more adaptable than physiological latencies. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Anticipation; Coincidence detection; Pacing; Perceptual timing; Synchronization","adaptive behavior; adult; anticipation; article; controlled study; human; human experiment; motor performance; normal human; perception; priority journal; sensorimotor function; task performance; Adolescent; Adult; Feedback; Humans; Knowledge of Results (Psychology); Photic Stimulation; Practice (Psychology); Psychomotor Performance; Time Factors; Time Perception; Transfer (Psychology)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748990074

In two experiments, participants viewed 12 target displays with values of log2(2A/W) (prescribed difficulty) ranging between 1.0 and 6.5 bits. Following each 15 s trial, participants provided magnitude estimates reflecting the difficulty that someone else would experience if they actually had to make targeted movements during the trial. The prospective difficulty estimates were always made in the absence of movement. In Experiment 1, target displays were presented to participants on their own video monitor, while in Experiment 2, all participants concurrently viewed scaled-up target displays projected onto a large screen. There were three main findings: First, in both experiments, the prospective-prescribed relation was strong and positive. This finding warrants two conclusions: Fitts' index of difficulty can be taken as an index of subjective difficulty in prospective action, and subjective estimates of performance difficulty result from the monitoring of feedforward control signals generated in the absence of movement-related feedback. Second, even with the large differences in the target display scale of Experiments 1 and 2, difficulty estimates were equivalent at common prescribed difficulty levels. In other words, the results of Experiment 1 were successfully replicated in Experiment 2. This finding demonstrates the generality of the prospective-prescribed relation. Third, nonlinearities in the prospective-prescribed relation resembled those seen in functions describing the increases in movement time that accompany increases in prescribed difficulty (Fitts' law). This observation suggests that the prospective difficulty estimates were based on the value of a temporal parameter in an implicit mental simulation of the action. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Fitts' law; Motor imagery; Prospective action; Psychophysics; Task difficulty","adult; article; controlled study; feedback system; female; human; human experiment; male; mental function; motor performance; normal human; priority journal; prospective study; psychophysics; psychophysiology; simulation; task performance; theory; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Movement; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychomotor Performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749353304

However, it is known that the presence of noise in the photocurrent can degrade the performance of this algorithm significantly, depending on the choice of the responsivity spectrum to be synthesized. We generalize this algorithm to accommodate noise. The results are applied to quantum-dot mid-infrared detectors with bias-dependent spectral responses.

The approach uses Timed Influence Nets (TINs) as the underlying mathematical model to capture a dynamic uncertain situation. TINs provide a concise graph-theoretic probabilistic approach to specify the cause and effect relationships that exist among the variables of interest (actions, desired effects, and other uncertain events) in a problem domain. The purpose of building these TIN models is to identify and analyze several alternative courses of action. The current practice is to use trial and error based techniques which are not only labor intensive but also produce sub-optimal results and are not capable of modeling constraints among actionable events. The EA based approach presented in this paper is aimed to overcome these limitations. The approach generates multiple COAs that are close enough in terms of achieving the desired effect. The purpose of generating multiple COAs is to give several alternatives to a decision maker. Moreover, the alternate COAs could be generalized based on the relationships that exist among the actions and their execution timings. The approach also allows a system analyst to capture certain types of constraints among actionable events.","Course of Action; Dynamic Bayesian Networks; Effects Based Operations; Evolutionary Algorithms; Optimization; Timed Influence Nets","Course of Action; Dynamic Bayesian Networks; Effects Based Operations; Timed Influence Nets; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Graph theory; Mathematical models; Optimization; Probabilistic logics; Evolutionary algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748454260

For example, humans have ∼30,000 cochlear neurons, but at least 1000 times as many neurons in the auditory cortex. Such apparently redundant internal representations have sometimes been proposed as necessary to overcome neuronal noise. We instead posit that they directly subserve computations of interest. Here we provide an example of how sparse overcomplete linear representations can directly solve difficult acoustic signal processing problems, using as an example monaural source separation using solely the cues provided by the differential filtering imposed on a source by its path from its origin to the cochlea [the head-related transfer function (HRTF)]. In contrast to much previous work, the HRTF is used here to separate auditory streams rather than to localize them in space. The experimentally testable predictions that arise from this model, including a novel method for estimating the optimal stimulus of a neuron using data from a multineuron recording experiment, are generic and apply to a wide range of sensory computations.

Modern cellular phones offer sophisticated features such as Internet access, on-board cameras, and expandable memory which provide these devices with excellent multimedia capabilities. Because of the high volume of cellular traffic, as well as the ability of these devices to transmit nearly all forms of data. The need for an increased level of security in wireless communications is becoming a growing concern. Steganography could provide a solution to this important problem. In this article, we present a new algorithm for JPEG-compressed images which is applicable to mobile platforms. This algorithm embeds sensitive information into quantized discrete cosine transform coefficients obtained from the cover JPEG. These coefficients are rearranged based on certain statistical properties and the inherent processing and memory constraints of mobile devices. Based on the energy variation and block characteristics of the cover image, the sensitive data is hidden by using a switching embedding technique proposed in this article. The proposed system offers high capacity while simultaneously withstanding visual and statistical attacks.

Ground vehicles are modeled using meshed geometric representations that allow the 3D heat equation to be solved simultaneously for every element in the mesh. This includes calculation of 3D heat conduction, convective heat transfer including plume impingement, and radiation exchange between parts of the vehicle. Due to computational limitations it is not possible to model IR synthetic scenes using this same approach. For most synthetic scenes it is not practical to create geometric representations of each blade of grass or of every leaf. Due to the differences in modeling paradigms it becomes problematic to couple the thermal solutions directly so that the vehicle and terrain interact. For this reason, radiation exchange between the vehicle and the terrain or the effects of plume impingement on the terrain are not often modeled within a synthetic scene. To address this limitation, MuSES 1 (the Multi-Service Electro-optic Signature code), an infrared signature prediction program developed for modeling ground vehicles and other man-made targets, has been integrated into CameoSim 2, a broadband scene simulation software system that produces high resolution synthetic imagery of natural terrestrial scenes. To achieve the desired level of thermal interaction, a geometric description of the terrain surrounding the target is exported from CameoSim into MuSES; MuSES then calculates the temperature of both the target and the supplied terrain. To minimize artifacts between the temperature prediction of the terrain local to and distant from the target, MuSES terrain thermal models can be specified for use in the greater CameoSim scene. The resulting software tool is capable of modeling large scale IR synthetic scenes that include full thermal interaction between the target and the terrain in an area local to the target.","Infrared; Modeling; Signature; Synthetic scene","Geometric representations; IR synthetic scenes; Man-made targets; Radiation exchange; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Ground vehicles; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Radiation; Infrared imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747342461

The resulting model numerically yields the same answer on training inputs as the model was derived from, and yields nonlinear interpolated transfer functions in frequency space for off-nominal cases.

Numerical analyses had been conducted for investigating the thermal-mechanical interaction in the interface between the gain medium and the diamond disks when the lasing process is in progress.

A monitoring architecture that accurately measures the link dynamics and promptly feeds this information to the system is vital to realize significant bandwidth aggregation performance gains.

Previous studies of irregularity have mainly used the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike interval distribution. Proper estimation of CV requires a constant underlying firing rate, a condition that most experimental situations do not fulfill either within or across trials. Here we introduce a novel irregularity metric based on the ratio of adjacent intervals in the spike train. The new metric is not affected by firing rate and is very localized in time so that it can be used to examine the time course of irregularity relative to an alignment marker. We characterized properties of the new metric with simulated spike trains of known characteristics and then applied it to data recorded from 108 single neurons in the motor cortex of two monkeys during performance of a precision grip task. Fifty-six cells were antidromically identified as pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). Sixty-one cells (30 PTNs) exhibited significant temporal modulation of their irregularity during task performance with the contralateral hand. The irregularity modulations generally differed in sign and latency from the modulations of firing rate. High irregularity tended to occur during the task phases requiring the most detailed control of movement, whereas neural firing became more regular during the steady hold phase. Such irregularity modulation could have important consequences for the response of downstream neurons and may provide insight into the nature of the cortical code.

Recent experiments demonstrate that contributions to synaptic plasticity from different spike pairs within a spike train do not add linearly. In the visual cortex conditioning with spike triplets shows that the effect of the first spike pair dominates over the second. Using a previously proposed calcium-dependent plasticity model, we show that short-term synaptic dynamics and interaction between successive back-propagating action potentials (BPAP) may jointly account for the nonlinearities observed.

Here we model sympatric speciation under selection that favors high values of either of the two independently inherited traits, each required to efficiently consume one of the two available resources, but acts, because of a tradeoff, against those possessing high values of both traits. Such two-dimensional incompatibility selection is similar to that involved in allopatric speciation. Using a hypergeometric phenotypic model, we show that incompatibility selection readily leads to sympatric speciation. In contrast to disruptive selection, two distinct modes of sympatric speciation exist under incompatibility selection: under strong tradeoffs both of the new species are specialists, each consuming its own resource, but under moderate tradeoffs speciation may be asymmetric and involve the origin of a specialist and a generalist species. Also, incompatibility selection may lead to irreversible specialization: under strong tradeoffs, the population speciates if it consists mostly of unspecialized individuals, but remains undivided if most of the individuals are specialized to consume one of the resources. Incompatibility selection appears to be more realistic than disruptive selection, implying that incompatibility between individually adaptive alleles or trait states drives both allopatric and sympatric speciation. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Evolution; Hypergeometric model; Resource; Tradeoff","allele; allopatry; article; computer simulation; genetic incompatibility; geometry; membrane damage; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; quantitative trait; resource allocation; sympatry; Animals; Computer Simulation; Genetic Speciation; Genetics, Population; Phenotype; Selection (Genetics); Sexual Behavior, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746783886

Simulations that emulated experimentally measured kinesiological data of young adults walking and running at the preferred walk-to-run transition speed revealed that muscles use similar biomechanical mechanisms to provide support and forward propulsion during the two tasks. The primary exception was a decreased contribution of the soleus to forward propulsion in running, which was previously found to be significant in walking. In addition, the soleus distributed its mechanical power differently to individual body segments between the two gait modes from mid- to late stance. In walking, the soleus transferred mechanical energy from the leg to the trunk to provide support, but in running it delivered energy to both the leg and trunk. In running, earlier soleus excitation resulted in it working in synergy with the hip and knee extensors near mid-stance to provide the vertical acceleration for the subsequent flight phase in running. In addition, greater power output was produced by the soleus and hip and knee extensors in running.

Automated techniques have been developed that address the WSD problem for a number of text processing situations, but the problem is still a challenging one. Supervised WSD machine learning (ML) methods have been applied in the biomedical domain and have shown promising results, but the results typically incorporate a number of confounding factors, and it is problematic to truly understand the effectiveness and generalizability of the methods because these factors interact with each other and affect the final results. Thus, there is a need to explicitly address the factors and to systematically quantify their effects on performance. Results: Experiments were designed to measure the effect of ""sample size"" (i.e. size of the datasets), ""sense distribution"" (i.e. the distribution of the different meanings of the ambiguous word) and ""degree of difficulty"" (i.e. the measure of the distances between the meanings of the senses of an ambiguous word) on the performance of WSD classifiers. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were applied to an automatically generated data set containing four ambiguous biomedical abbreviations: BPD, BSA, PCA, and RSV, which were chosen because of varying degrees of differences in their respective senses. Results showed that: 1) increasing the sample size generally reduced the error rate, but this was limited mainly to well-separated senses (i.e. cases where the distances between the senses were large); in difficult cases an unusually large increase in sample size was needed to increase performance slightly, which was impractical, 2) the sense distribution did not have an effect on performance when the senses were separable, 3) when there was a majority sense of over 90%, the WSD classifier was not better than use of the simple majority sense, 4) error rates were proportional to the similarity of senses, and 5) there was no statistical difference between results when using a 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation method. Other issues that impact performance are also enumerated. Conclusion: Several different independent aspects affect performance when using ML techniques for WSD. We found that combining them into one single result obscures understanding of the underlying methods. Although we studied only four abbreviations, we utilized a well-established statistical method that guarantees the results are likely to be generalizable for abbreviations with similar characteristics. The results of our experiments show that in order to understand the performance of these ML methods it is critical that papers report on the baseline performance, the distribution and sample size of the senses in the datasets, and the standard deviation or confidence intervals. In addition, papers should also characterize the difficulty of the WSD task, the WSD situations addressed and not addressed, as well as the ML methods and features used. This should lead to an improved understanding of the generalizablility and the limitations of the methodology. © 2006 Xu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"10-fold cross-validation; Automated techniques; Automatically generated; Base-line performance; Design and evaluations; NAtural language processing; Statistical differences; Word-sense disambiguation; Data mining; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Support vector machines; Text processing; Experiments; algorithm; analysis of variance; analytical error; article; automation; biomedicine; confidence interval; controlled study; language processing; learning; machine; methodology; sample size; simulation; task performance; validation process; word recognition; animal; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biology; controlled vocabulary; human; mathematical computing; natural language processing; nomenclature; procedures; statistical analysis; statistical model; Unified Medical Language System; Rice stripe virus; Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Models, Statistical; Natural Language Processing; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Terminology as Topic; Unified Medical Language System; Vocabulary, Controlled",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747450503

Predicted arm trajectories are the result of minimizing a nonlinear performance index that depends on kinematic or dynamic variables of the movement. A robust optimization algorithm is presented that computes trajectories which satisfy the necessary conditions with high accuracy. It is especially adapted to the analysis of discrete and rhythmic movements. The optimization problem is solved by parameterizing each generalized coordinate (e.g., joint angular displacement) in terms of Jacobi polynomials and Fourier series, depending on whether discrete or rhythmic movements are considered, combined with a multiple shooting algorithm. The parameterization of coordinates has two advantages. First, it provides an initial guess for the multiple shooting algorithm which solves the optimization problem with high accuracy. Second, it leads to a low dimensional representation of discrete and rhythmic movements in terms of expansion coefficients. The selection of a suitable feature space is an important prerequisite for comparison, recognition and classification of movements. In addition, the separate computational analysis of discrete and rhythmic movements is motivated by their distinct neurophysiological realizations in the cortex. By investigating different performance indices subject to different boundary conditions, the approach can be used to examine possible strategies that humans adopt in selecting specific arm motions for the performance of different tasks in a plane and in three-dimensional space.",,"Algorithms; Computation theory; Joint prostheses; Kinematics; Optimization; Polynomials; Problem solving; Mechanical linkage models; Multiple shooting algorithm; Robust optimization algorithm; Gait analysis; algorithm; arm; article; biological rhythm; biomechanics; brain; depth perception; elbow; feedback system; human; innervation; joint; joint characteristics and functions; movement (physiology); nonlinear system; orientation; periodicity; physiology; proprioception; psychomotor performance; shoulder; skeletal muscle; torque; vision; Algorithms; Arm; Biological Clocks; Biomechanics; Brain; Elbow Joint; Feedback; Humans; Joints; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Nonlinear Dynamics; Orientation; Periodicity; Proprioception; Psychomotor Performance; Range of Motion, Articular; Shoulder Joint; Space Perception; Torque; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745683974

The three performance parameters are the information or Swank factor determined from pulse-height spectra, the light output (either in absolute or relative scale), and the point-response function. Using this general methodology, we created screen models that exhibit good agreement with recent experimental measurements available in the literature, over a wide x-ray energy range (18-75 keV), and for front- and back-screen configurations.

For screen-film systems, scatter primarily affects the image contrast, reducing the conspicuity of subtle lesions. While digital systems can overcome contrast degradation, they remain susceptible to scatter's impact on the image resolution and noise. To better understand this impact, we have created a Monte Carlo model of a mammographic imaging system adaptable for different imaging situations. This model flags primary and scatter photons and therefore can produce primary-only, scatter-only, or primary plus scatter images. Resolution was assessed using the edge technique to compute the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The MTF of a selenium detector imaged with a 28 kVp Mo/Mo beam filtered through a 6 cm heterogeneous breast was 0.81, 0.0002, and 0.65 at 5 mm -1 for the primary beam, scatter-only, and primary plus scatter beam, respectively. Noise was measured from flat-field images via the noise power spectrum (NNPS). The NNPS-exposure product using the same imaging conditions was 1.5-10 -5 mm 2·mR, 1.6-10 -5 mm 2·mR, and 1.9-10 -5 mm 2·mR at 5 mm -1 for the primary, scatter, and primary plus scatter beam, respectively. The results show that scatter led to a notable low-frequency drop in the MTF and an increased magnitude of the NNPS-exposure product.

Existing technology allow mobile users to access Internet services (e.g. email and web surfing), simple multimedia services (e.g. music and video clips), and make telephone calls. However, the potential of advanced multimedia services has not been fully developed, especially multimedia for navigation or location based services. At Purdue University, we are developing an image database, known as LAID, in which every image is annotated with its location, compass heading, acquisition time, and weather conditions. LAID can be used to study several types of navigation problems: A mobile user can take an image and transmit the image to the LAID sever. The server compares the image with the images stored in the database to determine where the user is located. We refer to this as the ""forward"" navigation problem. The second type of problem is to provide a ""virtual tour on demand."" A user inputs a starting and an ending addresses and LAID retrieves the images along a route that connects the two addresses.

Proc. 11, 241-260] study on pigeons in the radial maze sparked research on landmark use by pigeons in lab-based tasks as well as variants of the radial-maze task. Pigeons perform well on open-field versions of the radial maze, with feeders scattered on the laboratory floor. Pigeons can also be trained to search precisely for buried food. The search can be based on multiple landmarks, but is sometimes controlled by just one or two landmarks, with the preferred landmarks varying across individuals. Findings are similar in landmark-based searching on a computer monitor and on a lab floor, despite many differences between the two kinds of tasks. A number of general learning principles are found in landmark-based searching, such as cue competition, generalization and peak shift, and selective attention. Pigeons also learn the geometry of the environment in which they are searching. Neurophysiological studies have implicated the hippocampal formation (HF) in avian spatial cognition, with the right hippocampus hypothesized to play a more important role in the spatial recognition of goal locations. Most recently, single-cell recording from the pigeon's hippocampal formation has revealed cells with different properties from the classic 'place' cells of rats, as well as differences in the two sides of the hippocampus. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

During laser irradiation, the process of photon absorption and thermal energy diffusion in the target tissue and its surrounding tissue are crucial. Such information allows the selection of proper operating parameters such as dye concentrations, laser power, and exposure time for optimal therapeutic effect. Combining the Monte Carlo method for energy absorption and the finite difference method for heat diffusion, the temperature distributions in target tissue and surrounding tissue in dye enhanced laser photothermal interaction are obtained. Different tissue configurations and dye enhancement are used in the simulation, and different incident beam sizes are also used to determine optimum beam sizes for various tissue configurations. Our results show that the algorithm developed in this study could predict the thermal outcome of laser irradiation. Our simulation indicates that with appropriate absorption enhancement of the target tissue, the temperature in the target tissue and in the surrounding tissue can be effectively controlled. This method can be used for optimization of lesion treatment using laser photothermal interactions.

This framework unifies the spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance (STC) approaches to neural characterization and recovers a set of linear filters that maximize mean and variance-dependent information between stimuli and spike responses. The resulting approach has several useful properties, namely, (1) it recovers a set of linear filters sorted according to their informativeness about the neural response; (2) it is both computationally efficient and robust, allowing recovery of multiple linear filters from a data set of relatively modest size; (3) it provides an explicit ""default"" model of the nonlinear stage mapping the filter responses to spike rate, in the form of a ratio of Gaussians; (4) it is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of this default model but also converges to the correct filter estimates whenever the conditions for the consistency of STA or STC analysis are met; and (5) it can be augmented with additional constraints on the filters, such as space-time separability.

An analysis of this phenomenon in the absence of noise is presented based on the probability flux within an ensemble of generalized integrate-and-fire neurons. It is shown that the induction of phase synchrony by a step input can be determined by calculating the ratio of the voltage densities obtained from fully desynchronized ensembles firing at the pre and post-step firing rates. In the limit of low noise and in the absence of phase synchrony, the probability density as a function of voltage is inversely proportional to the time derivative along the voltage trajectory. It follows that the magnitude of phase synchronization depends on the degree to which a change in input leads to a uniform multiplication of the voltage derivative over the range from reset to spike threshold. This analysis is used to investigate several factors affecting phase synchronization including high firing rates, inputs modeled as conductances rather than currents, peri-threshold sodium currents, and spike-triggered potassium currents. Finally, we show that without noise, the equilibrium ensemble density is proportional to the phase response curve commonly used to analyze oscillatory systems. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.","Exponential integrate-and-fire; Phase response curve; Population density; Synchrony","potassium; sodium; article; brain depth stimulation; brain nerve cell; calculation; cell synchronization; controlled study; equilibrium constant; oscillation; population density; potassium conductance; potassium current; priority journal; probability; simulation; sodium current; spike wave; Action Potentials; Animals; Biological Clocks; Brain; Cell Membrane; Cortical Synchronization; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Neurons; Potassium Channels; Sodium Channels; Synaptic Transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646512386

The slow component has been shown to account for the majority of sway variance during quiet stance. Postural control is generally viewed as a feedback loop in which sway is detected by sensory systems and appropriate motor commands are generated to stabilize the body's orientation. Whereas the mechanistic source for the damped-oscillatory sway component is most likely feedback control of an inverted pendulum, the underlying basis for the slow component is less clear. We investigated whether the slow process was inside or outside the feedback loop by providing standing subjects with sum-of-sines visual motion. Linear stochastic models were fit to the experimental sway trajectories to determine the stochastic structure of sway as well as the transfer function from visual motion to sway. The results supported a fifth-order stochastic model, consisting of a slow process and two damped-oscillatory components. Importantly, the slow process was determined to be inside the feedback loop. This supports the hypothesis that the slow component is due to errors in state estimation because state estimation is inside the feedback loop rather than a moving reference point or an exploratory process outside the feedback loop.

In two experiments, participants performed a rhythmic tapping task, attempting to produce isochronous intervals (range of 350-550 ms) while stimulation was applied over M1 or a control site. M1 stimulation was associated with increased variability of the inter-tap intervals (ITI), and, by manipulating stimulation intensity, we identified two distinct changes in performance: a generalized increase in ITI variability and a delay in the subsequent response when the pulse fell within a restricted window prior to movement onset. Using a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the general increase in variability and the temporally specific delay reflect disruption of response implementation processes rather than an increase in noise associated with response timing.

The assumption is valid for isocentric x-ray units such as radiotherapy simulators. However, the large majority of the clinics performing prostate brachytherapy today use C-arms for which imaging parameters such as source to axis distance, image acquisition angles, central axis of the image are not accurately known. We propose a seed reconstruction algorithm that requires no such knowledge of geometry. The new algorithm makes use of perspective projection matrix, which can be easily derived from a set of known reference points. The perspective matrix calculates the transformation of a point in 3D space to the imaging coordinate system. An accurate representation of the imaging geometry can be derived from the generalized projection matrix (GPM) with eleven degrees of freedom. In this paper we show how GPM can be derived given a theoretical minimum number of reference points. We propose an algorithm to compute the line equation that defines the backprojection operation given the GPM. The algorithm can be extended to any ray-tracing based seed reconstruction algorithms. Reconstruction using the GPM does not require calibration of C-arms and the images can be acquired at arbitrary angles. The reconstruction is performed in near real-time. Our simulations show that reconstruction using GPM is robust and accuracy is independent of the source to detector distance and location of the reference points used to generate the GPM. Seed reconstruction from C-arm images acquired at unknown geometry provides a useful tool for intra-operative dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.","C-arm; Camera matrix; Intra-operative dosimetry; Perspective transformation; Prostate brachytherapy; Seed reconstruction","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Dosimetry; Matrix algebra; Radiotherapy; Ray tracing; Camera matrix; Intra-operative dosimetry; Perspective transformation; Prostate brachytherapy; Seed reconstruction; Image reconstruction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745389197

Thus, we derive the lateral resolution in the presence of residual wave aberrations, which is inversely proportional to square root of the Strehl ratio. The modeling, while not sufficient in describing the fine structure of the real PSF, demonstrates good conformance to the lateral cross section of the real PSF. With this model, the lateral resolution of our current AOSLO was computed to be 1.65 to 2.33 μm, which agreed well with the actual result. We also reveal the relationships among the lateral resolution and other three measures of the AOSLO imaging property including the Strehl ratio, the PSF, and the root mean square (rms) of wavefront aberration. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Adaptive optics; Point spread function; Resolution; Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy","article; computer aided design; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; confocal microscopy; equipment; equipment design; evaluation; image enhancement; instrumentation; methodology; ophthalmoscope; optics; quality control; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; Benchmarking; Computer Simulation; Computer-Aided Design; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy, Confocal; Models, Statistical; Ophthalmoscopes; Optics; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Aberrations; Adaptive optics; Mathematical models; Optical instruments; Optical resolving power; Optical transfer function; Statistical optics; Wavefronts; Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope; Residual wavefront aberration; Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; Strehl ratio; Ophthalmology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744474873

As compared with Legacy type systems or physical mockups VEs also afford a smaller footprint and greater reconfigurability to support a variety of training tasks (Cohn, Helmick, Meyers & Burns, 2000).

The goal of our experiments was to investigate how the properties of space guide the remapping of motor coordination. Subjects wore an instrumented data glove that recorded the finger motions. Signals generated by the glove operated a remotely controlled endpoint: a cursor on a computer monitor. The subjects were instructed to execute movements of this endpoint with controlled motions of the fingers. This required inverting a highly redundant map from fingers to cursor motions. We found that 1) after training with visual feedback of the final error (but not of the ongoing cursor motion), subjects learned to map cursor locations into configurations of the fingers; 2) extended practice of movement led to more rectilinear cursor movement, a trend facilitated by training under continuous visual feedback of cursor motions; 3) with practice, subjects reduced motion in the degrees of freedom that did not contribute to the movements of the cursor; 4) with practice, subjects reduced variability of both cursor and hand movements; and 5) the reduction of errors and the increase in linearity generalized beyond the set of movements used for training. These findings suggest that subjects not only learned to produce novel coordinated movement to control the placement of the cursor, but they also developed a representation of the Euclidean space on which hand movements were remapped.

It will also be installed on the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP). These satellite systems fly in near-circular, sun-synchronous low-earth orbits at altitudes of approximately 830 km. VIIRS has 15 bands designed to measure reflectance with wavelengths between 412 nm and 2250 nm, and an additional 7 bands measuring primarily emissive radiance between 3700nm and 11450 nm. The calibration source for the reflective bands is a solar diffuser (SD) that is illuminated once per orbit as the satellite passes from the dark side to the light side of the earth near the poles. Sunlight enters VIIRS through an opening in the front of the instrument. An attenuation screen covers the opening, but other than this there are no other optical elements between the SD and the sun. The BRDF of the SD and the transmittance of the attenuation screen is measured preflight, and so with knowledge of the angles of incidence, the radiance of the sun can be computed and is used as a reference to produce calibrated reflectances and radiances. Unfortunately, the opening also allows a significant amount of reflected earthshine to illuminate part of the SD, and this component introduces radiometric error to the calibration process, referred to as earthshine contamination (ESC). The VIIRS radiometric error budget allocated a 0.3% error based on modeling of the ESC done by SBRS during the design phase. This model assumes that the earth has Lambertian BRDF with a maximum top-of-atmosphere albedo of 1. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has an SD with a design similar to VIIRS, and in 2003 the MODIS Science Team reported to Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST), the prime contractor for NPOESS, their suspicion that ESC was causing higher than expected radiometric error, and asked whether VIIRS might have a similar problem. The NPOESS Models and Simulation (M&S) team considered whether the Lambertian BRDF assumption would cause an underestimating of the ESC error. Particularly, snow, ice and water show very large BRDFs for geometries for forward scattered, near-grazing angles of incidence, and in common parlance this is called glare. The observed earth geometry during the period where the SD is illuminated by the sun has just such geometries that produce strongly forward scattering glare. In addition the SD acquisition occurs in the polar regions, where snow, ice and water are most prevalent. Using models in their Environmental Products Verification and Remote Sensing Testbed (EVEREST)‡, the M&S team produced a model that meticulously traced the light rays from the attenuation screen to each detector and combined this with a model of the satellite orbit, with solar geometry and radiative transfer models that include the effect of the BRDF of various surfaces. This modeling showed that radiometric errors up to 4.5% over water and 1.5% over snow or ice. Clouds produce errors up to 0.8%. The likelihood of these high errors occurring has not been determined. Because of this analysis, various remedial options are now being considered.","Calibration; Earthshine; NPOESS; Solar-diffuser; VIIRS","Computer simulation; Contamination; Environmental engineering; Image sensors; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Earthshine; NPOESS; Solar-diffuser; VIIRS; Solar equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33244471576

The separation procedure depends however fundamentally on the degree of polarization of the water leaving radiance. In this paper, we compare polarization effects and efficiency of the fluorescence retrieval by simulating the total and polarized reflectance of waterleaving radiances originating from elastic scattering in case 1 and case 2 waters using radiative transfer and multiple component Mie scattering programs. This is done by superimposing upon these reflectances the contribution of known fluorescence spectra, and by using our polarization discrimination procedure to invert the resulting data back into fluorescence spectra. It is shown that a Mie scattering code which does not take into account multiple scattering effects can strongly overestimate the degree of polarization for case 1 and case 2 waters as well as reflectances in the green part of the spectra. Making use of these results we propose and evaluate an improvement for the traditional height over baseline fluorescence extraction method which strongly overestimates fluorescence value for case 2 waters.

These methods are more amenable to automated on-line measurements and are believed to be less prone to erroneous results compared to techniques based on thermal noise analysis. Optical tweezers have been shown to be an effective tool in measuring the complex interactions of micro-scale particles with piconewton resolution. However, the accuracy of the measurements depends heavily on knowledge of the trap stiffness and the viscous drag coefficient for the trapped particle. The most commonly referenced approach to measuring the trap stiffness is the power spectrum method, which provides the characteristic frequency for the trap based on the roll-off of the frequency response of a trapped particle excited by thermal fluctuations. However, the reliance on thermal fluctuations to excite the trapping dynamics results in a large degree of uncertainty in the estimated characteristic frequency. These issues are addressed by two parameter estimation methods which can be implemented on-line for fast trap characterization. The first is a frequency domain system identification approach which combines swept-sine frequency testing with a least-squares transfer function fitting algorithm. The second is a recursive least-squares parameter estimation scheme. The algorithms and results from simulation studies are discussed in detail.","Optical trapping; Parameter estimation; Trap stiffness","Optical trapping; Trap stiffness; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Frequency response; Parameter estimation; Thermal noise; Transfer functions; Viscosity; Optical properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31844445824

This paper presents a novel method by which flow of these charge fluxes may be computed to provide directivity of charge movement. Simulations of charge flow as well as actual electrophysiological data recorded by tetrodes are used to demonstrate the method. The propagation of charge fluxes in space in data from simulation and actual recordings during action potential can be analyzed using signals recorded by tetrodes. Variation in spike directivity can be estimated by computing singular value decomposition of the estimated 3D trajectory data. The analysis of the spike model can be accomplished by performing simulations of presumed equivalent moving charges recorded by the tetrode tips. For in vivo spike recordings, the variation of spike directivity could be obtained using several spikes of selected neurons considering the charge movement model (CMM). The relationship between computer simulation results and tetrode data recordings is examined. The paper concludes by showing that the method for calculating directivity in actual spike recordings is robust. The method allows for improved filtering of data and more importantly may shed light on furthering the study of spatio-temporal encoding in neurons. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For field angles larger than θ 0, the point spread function (PSF) gradually degrades as the field angle increases. Knowledge of the space-varying PSF is essential for image reconstruction. In this paper, we present a technique to predict the PSF as function of the field angle. The results are validated by mean of simulations.

The algorithm resolves each joint angle-time trajectory of a multi-joint motion into a sequence of elemental motion segments and labels each motion segment with a symbol representing its shape ('U': monotonically increasing; 'D': monotonically decreasing; 'S': stationary). By concatenating symbols according to their order in time, the spatial-temporal structure of a joint angle-time trajectory is represented as a symbolic string. The structure of a multi-joint motion is then represented as a set of symbolic strings. A sample motion, whose structure is identified by the SMSR algorithm, can be generalized to produce an infinite number of similar motion variants. To generate a variant of a sample motion, segment boundary points of the sample motion are first relocated to new locations in the angle-time space, and then individual motion segments of the original joint angle trajectories are shifted and proportionally rescaled to fit the new segment boundary points. This motion generalization method provides a basis for developing GMP-based motion simulation models, and exploring ideas and hypotheses related to the GMP theory through simulation. As an application of the motion generalization method, a motion modification (MoM) algorithm is presented, which adapts existing reach motions for new target locations. Some examples generated by the MoM algorithm are illustrated. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous tasks in computational biology can be cast as analysis of relationships between these vectors, and the first step is, frequently, to compute their pairwise distance matrix. Many distance measures have been proposed in the literature, but there is no theory justifying the choice of distance measure. Results: We examine the approaches to measuring distances between binary vectors and study the characteristic properties of various distance measures and their performance in several tasks of genome analysis. Most distance measures between binary vectors turn out to belong to a single parametric family, namely generalized average-based distance with different exponents. We show that descriptive statistics of distance distribution, such as skewness and kurtosis, can guide the appropriate choice of the exponent. On the contrary, the more familiar distance properties, such as metric and additivity, appear to have much less effect on the performance of distances. © The Author 2005.

Range dependant atmospheric effects are incorporated, realistically degrading the infrared scene impinging on an infrared imaging device. Current sensor effects implementation for Paint the Night (PTN) and the Night Vision Image Generator (NVIG) is a 3 step process. First the scene energy is further attenuated by the sensor optic. Second, a prefilter kernel developed off-line, is applied to scenes or frames to affect the sensor modulation transfer function (MTF) ""blurring"" of scene elements. Thirdly, sensor noise is overlaid on scenes, or more often frames of scenes. NVESD is improving the PTN functionality, now entitled NVEOST, in several ways. In the near future, a sensor effects tool will directly read an NVTHERM input data file, extract that data which it can utilize and then automatically generate the sensor ""world view"" of a NVEOST scenario. These will include those elements currently employed: optical transmission, parameters used to calculate prefilter MTF (telescope, detector geometry) and temporal-spatial random noise (σTVH). Important improvements will include treatment of sampling effects (under sampling and super-resolution), certain significant postfilters (signal processing including boost and frame integration) and spatial noise.

Today MB-OPC is one of the key technologies enabling 90nm production. In that brief span many technological challenges were resolved to allow MB-OPC to be performed on full chip layout with manageable computer resources and turnaround times. As MB-OPC has transitioned from a research to a production activity, several organizational challenges have arisen. Defining the steps and procedures involved in creating OPC techfiles has been necessary to allow the increased workload to be shared. Testing and documenting the OPC recipes has become a necessary discipline to ensure quality and repeatability in manufacturing. In addition to the engineers who create the OPC recipes, we now also have Fab OPC Engineers to support OPC verification and continuous improvement activities. Furthermore, the OPC process, i.e. the modification of the layout to account for the manufacturing process, has provided a tantalizing link between the design, process development and yield engineering communities. The EDA framework appears to provide a common language, however we are just beginning to ask the right questions to allow us to unlock the potential that appears so close. The paper will begin with a historical overview of the development of MB-OPC and describe the seemingly overwhelming obstacles, both computational and in mask fabrication that had to be overcome. The second part of the paper will deal with some of the problems that have arisen as MB-OPC has become a critical technology for high volume production.

Lithography and lithographic process effects are quickly becoming a major concern for physical designers working at sub-wavelength process nodes. Beyond the rapidly expanding design rule deck, physical designers must have deeper access to and understanding of the process in order to grasp the full impact of layout changes on electrical performance. Process aberrations, such as misalignment, are manifested as CD variation resulting in parametric shifts and systematic yield problems. These yield issues must be addressed by designers, but designers do not have adequate tools nor information to fully comprehend these issues. To correct this situation, a new approach is needed to bring information from the manufacturing process upstream into the design creation process. This work extends and generalizes concepts presented in [1-3] and presents an integrated implementation of the methodology in a complete, self-consistent flow. This methodology integrates calibrated process simulation, electrical circuit performance analysis and optionally, automatic Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) into a comprehensive Design-for-Manufacturing (DFM) flow. Process window simulations uncover design-process interactions across multiple process variables (misalignment, bias, etc.). To characterize the process, a design of experiments qualifies the impact of design variation on electrical performance.

Subjects (n=30) walked on a motorized linear treadmill at 4.0 km h-1 for 24 min while viewing the interior of a 3D virtual scene projected on to a screen 1.5 m in front of them. The virtual scene depicted constant self-motion equivalent to either (1) walking around the perimeter of a room to one's left (Rotating Room group) or (2) walking down the center of a hallway (Infinite Corridor group). The scene was static for the first 4 min and then constant rate self-motion was simulated for the remaining 20 min. Before and after the treadmill locomotion adaptation period subjects performed five stepping trials. In each trial they marched in place to the beat of a metronome at 90 steps min-1 for a total of 100 steps while blindfolded in a quiet room. The subject's final heading direction (deg) and final X (fore-aft, cm) and final Y (medio-lateral, cm) positions were measured for each trial. During the treadmill locomotion adaptation period subjects' 3D torso position was measured. We found that subjects in the Rotating Room group, as compared with the Infinite Hallway group: (1) showed significantly greater deviation during post-exposure testing in the heading direction and Y position opposite to the direction of optic flow experienced during treadmill walking; and (2) showed a significant monotonically increasing torso yaw angular rotation bias in the direction of optic flow during the treadmill adaptation exposure period. Subjects in both groups showed greater forward translation (in the +X direction) during the post-treadmill stepping task that differed significantly from their pre-exposure performance. Subjects in both groups reported no perceptual deviation in position during the stepping tasks. We infer that viewing simulated rotary self-motion during treadmill locomotion causes adaptive modification of sensorimotor integration in the control of position and trajectory during locomotion, which functionally reflects adaptive changes in the integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues. Such an adaptation in the control of position and heading direction during locomotion, because of the congruence of sensory information, demonstrates the potential for adaptive transfer between sensorimotor systems and suggests a common neural site for processing and self-motion perception and concurrent adaptation in motor output. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"adaptation; adult; article; association; head movement; human; human experiment; locomotion; normal human; optics; perception; priority journal; proprioception; rotation; sensorimotor function; sensory stimulation; treadmill; trunk; vestibular stimulation; virtual reality; vision; walking; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Biomechanics; Humans; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Posture; Psychomotor Performance; Rotation; User-Computer Interface; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26044454890

In order to solve space-time variant inverse problems known as blind source separation, a novel Helmholtz free energy contrast function, H = E - T0S, with imposed thermodynamics constraint at a constant temperature T0 was introduced generalizing the Shannon maximum entropy S of the closed systems to the open systems having non-zero input-output energy exchange E. Here, only the input data vector was known while source vector and mixing matrix were unknown.

The Jones pupil assigns a Jones matrix to each point of the exit pupil describing the impact of both the global phase and the polarization on imaging. While we can learn already a lot about the optical system by taking a close look at the Jones pupil - and starting imaging simulations from it - a quantitative assessment is necessary for a complete evaluation of imaging. To do this, we generalize the concept of scalar Zernike aberrations to Jones-Zernike aberrations by expansion of the Jones pupil into vector polynomials. The resulting method is non-paraxial, i.e. the effect of the polarization dependent contrast loss for high numerical apertures is included. The aberrations of the Jones-matrix pupil are a suitable tool to identify the main drivers determining the polarization performance. Furthermore, they enable us to compare the polarized and the unpolarized performance of the such characterized lithographic system.","Aberrations; Hyper-NA imaging; Lithography; Polarization; Zernike-polynomials","Contrast loss; Hyper-NA imaging; Zernike-polynomials; Aberrations; Computer simulation; Light polarization; Numerical methods; Optical systems; Polynomials; Imaging systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144433305

Earlier work modeled this computation via a population of basis elements and used system identification techniques to estimate the tuning properties of the bases from the patterns of generalization. Here we hypothesized that the neural representation of planned sensory states in the internal model might resemble the signals from the peripheral sensors. These sensors normally encode the limb's actual sensory state in which movement errors occurred. We developed a set of equations based on properties of muscle spindles that estimated spindle discharge as a function of the limb's state during reaching and drawing of circles. We then implemented a simulation of a two-link arm that learned to move in various force fields using these spindle-like bases. The system produced a pattern of adaptation and generalization that accounted for a wide range of previously reported behavioral results. In particular, the bases showed gain-field interactions between encoding of limb position and velocity, very similar to the gain fields inferred from behavioral studies. The poor sensitivity of the bases to limb acceleration predicted behavioral results that were confirmed by experiment. We suggest that the internal model of limb dynamics is computed by the brain with neurons that encode the state of the limb in a manner similar to that expected of muscle spindle afferents. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computational methods; Error analysis; Functions; Mathematical models; Muscle; Sensitivity analysis; Sensors; Set theory; Torque; Internal models; Limb dynamics; Peripheral sensors; Sensory states; Biological organs; arm movement; article; brain function; kinematics; movement perception; muscle function; muscle spindle; muscle spindle afferent nerve; nerve cell network; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; sensory stimulation; simulation; visuomotor coordination; Arm; Brain; Computer Simulation; Feedback; Humans; Models, Neurological; Movement; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Spindles; Muscle, Skeletal; Musculoskeletal Equilibrium; Proprioception; Reflex, Stretch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044436831

ICA of the perturbations in the spatial intensity distribution measured on the medium boundary sorts out the embedded objects. The locations and optical characteristics of the embedded objects are obtained from a Green's function analysis based on any appropriate model for light propagation in the background medium. This approach is shown to locate and characterize absorptive and scattering inhomogeneities within highly scattering medium to a high degree of accuracy. In particular, we show this approach can discriminate between absorptive and scattering inhomogeneities, and can locate and characterize complex inhomogeneities, which are both absorptive and scattering.

Extant haptic training simulator research primarily emphasizes realistic stimuli representation; however, the experiments reported herein suggest that providing augmented feedback can improve training effectiveness, even when the feedback is not natural. A novel clinical breast examination training device uses inflated balloons embedded in silicone to simulate breast lumps. Oscillating the balloon water pressure makes the lumps pulsate. The pulsating lumps are easier to detect than the static lumps used in current simulators, and this manipulation seems to effectively introduce trainees to small, deep lumps that are initially difficult to perceive. A study of 48 medical students indicates that training with the dynamic breast model increased the number of lumps detected, F(1, 47) = 9.34, p = .004, decreased the number of false positives, F(1, 47) = 5.78, p = .020, and improved intersimulator skill transfer, F(1, 47) = 26.56, p < .001. The results suggest that at least in this case, augmented, tactile feedback increases training effectiveness, despite the fact that the feedback does not attempt to mimic any physical phenomenon present in the natural stimulus.

The effector phases are conveniently modeled by the K/BxN serum transfer system, a robust model well suited for genetic analysis where arthritis is initiated by pathogenic Ig. Here, we mapped the genetic loci distinguishing the high-responder BALB/c vs. low-responder SJL strains. After computational modeling of potential breeding schemes, we adapted a stepwise selective breeding strategy, with a whole-genome scan performed on a limited number of animals. Several genomic regions proved significantly associated with high sensitivity to arthritis. One of these regions, on distal chr2, was centered on the interleukin 1 gene family. Quantitation of transcripts of the II1a and II1b candidate genes revealed a 10-fold greater induction of II1b mRNA in BALB/c than in SJL splenocytes after injection of LPS, whereas II1a showed much less difference. The differential activity of the II1b gene was associated with a particular sequence haplotype of noncoding polymorphisms. The BALB/c haplotype was found in 75% of wild-derived strains but was rare among conventional inbred strains (4/33 tested, one of which is DBA/1, the prototype arthritis-susceptible strain) and was associated with vigorous II1b responses in a panel of inbred strains. Inbred strains carrying this allele were far more responsive to serum-transferred arthritis, confirming its broad importance in controlling arthritis severity. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Autoimmunity; Genetics; Inflammation; Mouse Phenome Project","immunoglobulin; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; interleukin 1; messenger RNA; allele; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; arthritis; article; autoimmunity; breeding; chr2 gene; disease predisposition; disease severity; female; gene; gene control; gene expression; gene induction; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic analysis; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genome analysis; haplotype; inflammation; male; mouse; mouse strain; multigene family; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; spleen cell; animal; arthritis; Bagg albino mouse; biological model; biosynthesis; chromosome map; comparative study; computer simulation; gene expression; genetics; human; immunology; nonobese diabetic mouse; species difference; Animalia; Animals; Arthritis, Experimental; Chromosome Mapping; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression; Humans; Interleukin-1; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred NOD; Models, Genetic; RNA, Messenger; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24644504780

Good quantitative agreement is found between the theoretical transmission function obtained by transfer matrix formalism and the measurement of a CROW interferometer realized in polymer material.",,"Band structure; Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Crystalline materials; Feedback; Interferometers; Light propagation; Optical resonators; Switching; Coupled cavity waveguides (CCW); Coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROW); Optical pulses; Optical switching; Optical waveguides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23744441262

Symptoms are manifested as impairment of motor, sensory, or psychic function with or without loss of consciousness or convulsive seizures. This paper presents an initial post-operative heat transfer analysis of surgery performed on a 41 year-old man with medically intractable Epilepsy. The surgery involved tumor removal and the resection of adjacent epileptogenic tissue. Electrocorticography was performed before resection. Cold saline was applied to the resulting interictal spike foci resulting in transient, complete cessation of spiking. A transient one dimensional semi-infinite finite element model of the surface of the brain was developed to simulate the surgery. An approximate temperature distribution of the perfused brain was developed by applying the bioheat equation. The model quantifies the surface heat flux reached in achieving seizure cessation to within an order of magnitude. Rat models have previously shown that the brain surface temperature range to rapidly terminate epileptogenic activity is 20-24 °C. The developed model predicts that a constant heat flux of approximately -13,000 W/m 2, applied at the surface of the human brain, would achieve a surface temperature in this range in approximately 3 seconds. A parametric study was subsequently performed to characterize the effects of brain metabolism and brain blood perfusion as a function of the determined heat flux. The results of these findings can be used as a first approximation in defining the specifications of a cooling device to suppress seizures in human models.","Bioheat Equation; Brain Cooling; Epilepsy; Focal Cooling; Implantable Device","Biomedical equipment; Computer simulation; Cooling; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Living systems studies; Mathematical models; Metabolism; Neurology; Surgery; Bioheat equations; Brain cooling; Epilepsy; Focal cooling; Implanatble devices; Brain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23244449051

The model was based on the premise that the hand prehensile configuration in a power grip best conforms to the object shape. This premise was embodied by an optimization procedure that minimized the sum of distances from the finger joints to the object surface. The model was evaluated against data from an experiment that measured the grasp postures of 28 subjects having diverse anthropometry. The intra- and inter-person variabilities in grip postures were empirically assessed and used as benchmark values for model evaluation. The evaluation showed that the root-mean-square (RMS) values of angle differences between the predicted and measured postures had a 13.7°grand mean (across all joints, subjects, and two cylindrical handles grasped), whereas the RMS values of the inter- and intra-person variabilities in measured postures had grand means of 13.0°and 4.4°, respectively. The model can be readily generalized to the prediction of postures in power-grasping objects of different shapes, and adapted for testing alternative prehensile strategies or performance criteria. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that collecting and appropriately processing the out-of-focus light will allow an axial sampling rate below that specified by the Nyquist criterion. To achieve this, a central detector pinhole and a number of out-of-focus regions are collected concurrently. This corresponds to imaging through several different channels, with differing point spread functions, in parallel. Since the spatial sampling rate is below the Nyquist frequency, aliasing occurs in the data from each of the channels. However, since the point spread functions are different, the aliasing effects are different in each channel. This allows the ensemble of aliased images to be processed into a single dealiased and deconvolved image. This potential utility of out-of-focus light is demonstrated through simulated examples for differing collection schemes and scanning rates. Results are shown for under-sampling by up to a factor of four. Collecting the out-of-focus light also improves instrument collection efficiency.","Aliasing; Confocal collection efficiency; Confocal microscopy; Confocal pinhole; High speed microscopy; Image acquisition time; Out-of-focus light; Sampling rate","Charge coupled devices; Computer simulation; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Optical transfer function; Sampling; Signal to noise ratio; Aliasing; Confocal collection efficiency; Confocal microscopy; Confocal pinholes; High speed microscopy; Image acquisition time; Out-of-focus light; Sampling rate; Microscopic examination",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21844473054

This study is a selective treatment of the wideband array processing under some specific assumptions. Shannon Spatial Sampling Limit defines an upper bound for the frequency of transmission given certain element spacings in arrays. Beyond this bound, the exceeded ambiguity, due to spatial aliasing, avoids correct estimation of the signal parameters -e.g. the Direction Of Arrival (DOA), which is of our interest in this study. In another vein, decreasing the element spacing to meet a wider spectral support is difficult to implement due to the electromagnetic mutual coupling of the sensor elements in the array and the reduction of the resolution*. This work is an attempt to develop a methodology for resolving this ambiguity or aliasing in the wideband scenario using statistical signal processing. Our approach is heuristic. We consider known implementations, adopt them to meet our scenario and then analyze the performance of our proposed method. Although the models and the formulations presented in this survey can be further generalized, we limit our discussion mainly to the Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA). Many of the topics discussed in this study have a potential for being useful in practical applications, since they would allow a realistic modeling and offer more flexibility than the conventional array processing framework, hence we believe that there is already sufficient interest in this study.","Aliasing, uniform linear array; Antenna array processing; Beamforming; Doa estimation; Ultra wideband (uwb)","Aliasing; Antenna array processing; Beamforming; DOA estimation; Ultra Wideband (UWB); Uniform linear array; Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Mathematical models; Sensors; Signal processing; Antenna arrays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344368849

The following GLI characteristics are recognized from the calibration results. First, GLI underestimates the radiance in channels 1, 2, 4, and 5. Next, in near-infrared channels, it is suggested that GLI overestimates the radiance on the order of 15% in channels 18 and 19.

H3A 1B1, Canada","Previous studies have used transfer of learning over workspace locations as a means to determine whether subjects code information about dynamics in extrinsic or intrinsic coordinates. Transfer has been observed when the torque associated with joint displacement is similar between work-space locations - rather than when the mapping between hand displacement and force is preserved - which is consistent with muscle- or joint-based encoding. In the present study, we address the generality of an intrinsic coding of dynamics and examine how generalization occurs when the pattern of torques varies over the workspace. In two initial experiments, we examined transfer of learning when the direction of a force field was fixed relative to an external frame of reference. While there were no beneficial effects of transfer after training at a single location (experiments 1 and 2), excellent performance was observed at the center of the workspace after training at two lateral locations (experiment 2). Experiment 3 and associated simulations assessed the characteristics of this generalization. In these studies, we examined the patterns of transfer observed after adaptation to force fields that were composed of two subfields that acted in opposite directions. The experimental and simulated data are consistent with the idea that information about dynamics is encoded in intrinsic coordinates. The nervous system generalizes dynamics learning by interpolating between sets of control signals, each locally adapted to different patterns of torques.

Three-dimensional computational models are developed to investigate flow-mixing and oxygen-transfer characteristics/or stationary and pulsating balloons, using the spectral element method. For a stationary balloon, the effect of the fiber placement within the fiber bundle and the number of fiber rings is investigated. In a pulsating balloon, the flow mixing characteristics are determined and the oxygen transfer rate is evaluated. For a stationary balloon, numerical simulations show two well-defined flow patterns that depend on the region of the IMO device. Successive increases of the Reynolds number raise the longitudinal velocity without creating secondary flow. This characteristic is not affected by staggered or non-staggered fiber placement within the fiber bundle. For a pulsating balloon, the flow mixing is enhanced by generating a three-dimensional time-dependent flow characterized by oscillatory radial, pulsatile longitudinal, and both oscillatory and random tangential velocities. This three-dimensional flow increases the flow mixing due to an active time-dependent secondary flow, particularly around the fibers. Analytical models show the fiber bundle placement effect on the pressure gradient and flow pattern. The oxygen transport from the fiber surface to the mean flow is due to a dominant radial diffusion mechanism, for the stationary balloon. The oxygen transfer rate reaches an asymptotic behavior at relatively low Reynolds numbers. For a pulsating balloon, the time-dependent oxygen-concentration field resembles the oscillatory and wavy nature of the time-dependent flow. Sherwood number evaluations demonstrate that balloon pulsations enhance the oxygen transfer rate, even for smaller flow rates.

We hypothesized that this model would show that: (i) tendon mechanical behavior is not solely governed by the isotropic matrix and fiber stretch, but is also influenced by fiber-matrix interactions; and (ii) shear fiber-matrix interaction terms will better describe tendon mechanical behavior than bulk fiber-matrix interaction terms. Model versions that did and did not include fiber-matrix interaction terms were applied to experimental tendon stress-strain data in longitudinal and transverse orientations, and the R2 goodness-of-fit was evaluated. This study showed that models that included fiber-matrix interaction terms improved the fit to longitudinal data (R2Toe = 0.88, R2 Lin = 0.94) over models that only included isotropic matrix and fiber stretch terms (R2Toe = 0.36, R2Lin = 0.84). Shear fiber-matrix interaction terms proved to be responsible for the best fit to data and to contribute to stress-strain nonlinearity. The mathematical model of tendon behavior developed in this study showed that fiber-matrix interactions are an important contributor to tendon behavior. The more complete characterization of mechanical behavior afforded by this mathematical model can lead to an improved understanding of structure-function relationships in soft tissues and, ultimately, to the development of tissue-engineered therapies for injury or degeneration.

These alternatives, which may characterize 'movement techniques' (e.g., the stoop and the squat lifting technique), may be associated with significantly different biomechanical constraints and physiological responses. Despite the widely shared understanding of the significance of alternative movement techniques, quantitative representation and identification of movement techniques have received little attention, especially for three-dimensional whole-body motions. In an attempt to systematically differentiate movement techniques, this study introduces a quantitative index termed joint contribution vector (JCV) representing a motion in terms of contributions of individual joint degrees-of-freedom to the achievement of the task goal. Given a set of uncharacterized (unlabeled) motions represented by joint angle trajectories (motion capture data), the JCV and statistical clustering methods enable automated motion classification to uncover a taxonomy of alternative movement techniques. The results of our motion data analyses show that the JCV was able to characterize and discern stoop and squat lifting motions, and also to identify movement techniques for a three-dimensional, whole-body, one-handed load-transfer task. The JCV index would facilitate consideration of alternative movement techniques in a variety of applications, including work method comparison and selection, and human motion modeling and simulation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Their movement patterns were recorded and compared to adaptive foraging tactics such as minimizing distance or energy expenditure, thigmotaxis, and trail following. They were also compared to the predictions of the associative route-finder model of Reid and Staddon [Reid, A.K., Staddon, J.E.R., 1998. A dynamic route finder for the cognitive map. Psychol. Rev. 105 (3), 585-601]. We manipulated the presence/absence of food, goal cups, and a wooden runway to determine the influence of local and distal stimuli (visual, olfactory, and tactile) on movement patterns. Increased experience in the arena produced decreases in travel distance and time to the food sources. Local and distal stimuli influenced movement patterns in ways compatible with visual beacons and trail following. The route-finder model accurately predicted movement patterns except those that were influenced by local and distal stimuli. These results show how certain stimuli influence movement and provide a guide for the incorporation of local and distal stimuli in a future version of the dynamic route-finder model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) has proven a useful framework for the task of computational gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes, due to its flexibility and probabilistic underpinnings. As the focus of the gene finding community shifts toward the use of homology information to improve prediction accuracy, extensions to the basic GHMM model are being explored as possible ways to integrate this homology information into the prediction process. Particularly prominent among these extensions are those techniques which call for the simultaneous prediction of genes in two or more genomes at once, thereby increasing significantly the computational cost of prediction and highlighting the importance of speed and memory efficiency in the implementation of the underlying GHMM algorithms. Unfortunately, the task of implementing an efficient GHMM-based gene finder is already a nontrivial one, and it can be expected that this task will only grow more onerous as our models increase in complexity. Results. As a first step toward addressing the implementation challenges of these next-generation systems, we describe in detail two software architectures for GHMM-based gene finders, one comprising the common array-based approach, and the other a highly optimized algorithm which requires significantly less memory while achieving virtually identical speed. We then show how both of these architectures can be accelerated by a factor of two by optimizing their content sensors. We finish with a brief illustration of the impact these optimizations have had on the feasibility of our new homology-based gene finder, TWAIN. Conclusions. In describing a number of optimizations for GHMM-based gene finders and making available two complete open-source software systems embodying these methods, it is our hope that others will be more enabled to explore promising extensions to the GHMM framework, thereby improving the state-of-the-art in gene prediction techniques. © 2005 Majoros et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Computational costs; Decoding algorithm; Generalized hidden markov models; Homology information; Open source software systems; Optimized algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Prediction process; Algorithms; Computational efficiency; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Optimization; Genes; accuracy; article; computer program; cost benefit analysis; DNA sequence; eukaryote; feasibility study; gene expression; genetic algorithm; genetic code; genome; mathematical computing; prediction; probability; sequence homology; statistical analysis; algorithm; Bayes theorem; biological model; biology; chemistry; computer language; computer simulation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic database; human; human genome; procedures; sequence alignment; statistical model; Eukaryota; DNA; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Databases, Genetic; DNA; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome; Genome, Human; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Probability; Programming Languages; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244265565

It was hypothesized that for people who are highly susceptible to motion-induced sickness, the perceptual adaptation training method would transfer from a controlled laboratory environment to a real-world situation. Ten participants from a previous laboratory study were tested on a real-world virtual reality entertainment device. The results showed that subjects who had experienced adaptation training on the optokinetic OKN device had lower dizziness scores on the real world game. However, subjects who had experienced adaptation training on the VE device (HMD) did not have lower dizziness scores. This pattern of results suggests that crossover training from controlled laboratory environments to real-world environments is likely to be one-directional and platform specific.

However, static images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions communicate with each other. In this study, advanced methods for the estimation of cortical connectivity from combined high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are presented. These methods include a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual magnetic resonance images, multidipole source model, and regularized linear inverse source estimates of cortical current density. Determination of the priors in the resolution of the linear inverse problem was performed with the use of information from the hemodynamic responses of the cortical areas as revealed by block-designed (strength of activated voxels) fMRI. We estimate functional cortical connectivity by computing the directed transfer function (DTF) on the estimated cortical current density waveforms in regions of interest (ROIs) on the modeled cortical mantle. The proposed method was able to unveil the direction of the information flow between the cortical regions of interest, as it is directional in nature. Furthermore, this method allows to detect changes in the time course of information flow between cortical regions in different frequency bands. The reliability of these techniques was further demonstrated by elaboration of high-resolution EEG and fMRI signals collected during visually triggered finger movements in four healthy subjects. Connectivity patterns estimated for this task reveal an involvement of right parietal and bilateral premotor and prefrontal cortical areas. This cortical region involvement resembles that revealed in previous studies where visually triggered finger movements were analyzed with the use of separate EEG or fMRI measurements. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Also, under less bursty traffic, the traditional fixed thresholding approach achieves higher throughput at the expense of higher cell loss rate. The integration of these two properties into practice is termed adaptive dynamic buffer management (ADBM) approach for input buffers and its assessment is the objective of this paper. The argument is that, given that the traffic conditions are constantly changing, to achieve efficiency during actual operation, the network control must dynamically switch, at every ATM switch, under the call processor's control, between the two input buffer management techniques, dictated by the nature of the traffic at the inputs of the corresponding switch. The need to involve the call processor marks the first effort in the literature to dynamically configure input buffer management architectures at the switch fabric level under higher level call processor control. It stems from the fact that the switch fabric operates very fast and cannot engage in complex decision making without incurring stiff penalty. To achieve this goal, the network control needs knowledge of the burstiness of the traffic at the inputs of every ATM switch. The difficulties with this need are two-fold. First, it is not always easy to obtain the traffic model and model parameters for a specific user's call. Second, even where the traffic model and the model parameters are known for a specific user's call, this knowledge is valid only at the source switch where the user interfaces with the network. At all other switches in the network, the cells of the traffic in question interact asynchronously with the cells from other traffic sources and are subject to statistical multiplexing. Thus, to obtain the exact nature of the composite traffic at the inputs of any ATM switch, is a challenge. Conceivably, one may determine the burstiness by counting the number of cells incurred at the inputs of an ATM switch over a defined time interval. The challenge posed by this proposition lies in the very definition of burstiness in that the time interval must approach, in the limit, zero or the resolution of time in the network. To address this challenge, first, a 15-node representative ATM network is modeled in an asynchronous, distributed simulator and, second, simulated on a network of workstations under realistic traffic stimuli. Third, burstiness indices are measured for the synthetic, stochastic traffic at the inputs of every ATM switch as a function of the progress of simulation for different choices of time interval values, ranging from 20,000 timesteps down to 1,000 timesteps. A timestep equals 2.73 μs. Results reveal that consistent burstiness indices are obtained for interval choices between 1,000 and 5,000 timesteps and that a burstiness index of 25, measured at 3,000 timestep interval, constitutes a reasonable and practical threshold value that distinguishes highly bursty traffic that warrants the use of the fuzzy thresholding approach from less bursty traffic that can benefit from the fixed thresholding scheme. A comparative performance analysis of ADBM yields the following. For pure fixed and pure fuzzy thresholding schemes, the throughputs are at 73.88% and 71.53% while the cell drop rates are at 4.31% and 2.44%, respectively. For the ADBM approach, where the input buffer management alternates at each individual ATM switch between the fixed and fuzzy schemes, governed by measured burstiness index threshold of 25 for a 3,000 timestep interval, the throughput is 74.77%, which is higher than even the pure fixed scheme while the cell drop rate is 2.21% that is lower than that of the pure fuzzy scheme. In essence, ADBM successfully integrates the best characteristics of the fuzzy and fixed thresholding schemes.

In this case study, the two factors are presence (Patients with Alzheimer's disease) or absence (Control) of the disease, and brain regions including olfactory bulb (OB) or cerebellum (CER). In the design considered in this manuscript, OB and CER are repeated measurements from the same subject and, hence, are correlated. It is critical to identify sources of variability in the analysis of oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures and correlations among data points have to be considered. In addition, multiple testing problems are more complicated in experiments with multi-level treatments or treatment combinations. Results: In this study we adopted a linear mixed model to analyze oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures. We first construct a generalized F test to select differentially expressed genes. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% was applied to the P values of the generalized F test. For those genes with significant generalized F test, we then categorize them based on whether the interaction terms were significant or not at the α-level (αnew = 0.0033) determined by the FDR procedure. Since simple effects may be examined for the genes with significant interaction effect, we adopt the protected Fisher's least significant difference test (LSD) procedure at the level of α new to control the familywise error rate (FWER) for each gene examined. Conclusions: A linear mixed model is appropriate for analysis of oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures. We constructed a generalized F test to select differentially expressed genes, and then applied a specific sequence of tests to identify factorial effects. This sequence of tests applied was designed to control for gene based FWER. © 2004 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Differentially expressed gene; Least Significant Difference tests; Microarray data analysis; Multiple testing problems; Oligonucleotide arrays; Repeated measurements; Sources of variability; Treatment combinations; Bit error rate; Brain; Genes; Oligonucleotides; Statistical tests; Experiments; beta 2 microglobulin; cathepsin; DNA; high mobility group N2 protein; scleroprotein; tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein; aged; Alzheimer disease; analytic method; analytical error; article; autopsy; brain region; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis; DNA microarray; down regulation; factorial analysis; female; gene expression; gene interaction; genetic analysis; genetic variability; human; human cell; human tissue; mathematical analysis; olfactory bulb; sequence analysis; statistical model; upregulation; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; biological model; biology; computer program; computer simulation; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; metabolism; multivariate analysis; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; statistical analysis; Martes pennanti; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Cerebellum; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Multivariate Analysis; Olfactory Bulb; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244259309

Various transforms, whether fixed or adaptive, have been utilized for video compression. However, these transforms are inherently sub-optimal in a coding-efficiency sense, given that their design does not explicitly take into account the entire transform coding model. Thus, commonly used transforms such as the DCT have desirable properties, but were designed without the full consideration of the other transform coding elements including quantization and entropy coding. Although these transforms have good performance in a rate-distortion sense, as demonstrated by today's image and video coding standards, we show that superior transforms can be designed based on the complete transform coding model. We present a new class of transforms called coding-adaptive transforms, that are derived under an optimality criterion which incorporates the elements of transform coding and is formulated for coding efficiency.

Accessing these states by applying, and varying the direction of, an external electric field is a key principle for the operation of devices such as non-volatile ferroelectric random access memories (NFERAMs). Compared with bulk ferroelectrics, low-dimensional finite ferroelectric structures promise to increase the storage density of NFERAMs 10,000-fold. But this anticipated benefit hinges on whether phase transitions and multi-stable states still exist in low-dimensional structures. Previous studies have suggested that phase transitions are impossible in one-dimensional systems, and become increasingly less likely as dimensionality further decreases. Here we perform ab initio studies of ferroelectric nanoscale disks and rods of technologically important Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 solid solutions, and demonstrate the existence of previously unknown phase transitions in zero-dimensional ferroelectric nanoparticles.

To reduce the atmospheric turbulence effect, adaptive optics may be used to enhance fringe visibility for stellar interferometers with aperture sizes larger than the atmospheric coherence length. Fringe visibility performance evaluation for long baseline stellar interferometers with and without adaptive optics is presented in this paper. The methodologies used in this paper are described as follows: the optical transfer function for stellar interferometers with large apertures is derived first; then, performance metrics, coherence loss factor and Strehl ratio, are defined. Finally, fringe visibility performance with and without adaptive optics for different turbulent strengths is evaluated using computer simulation results. We show that Noll's mean square residual phase error can be used to compare the coherence loss factor of an interferometer with the Strehl ratio of a single telescope.","Adaptive optics; Atmospheric turbulence; Stellar interferometry; Zernike polynomial","Phase corruption; Single aperture telescope; Stellar interferometers; Superimposed waves; Aberrations; Adaptive optics; Atmospheric turbulence; Coherent light; Computer simulation; Integral equations; Interferometry; Light interference; Optical transfer function; Telescopes; Visibility; Wavefronts; Interferometers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144259748

We used a Radiative Transfer Model to simulate a wide range surface dielectric, roughness, vegetation with random orientated disks database for our algorithm development under HYDROS radar sensor (L-band multi-polarizations and 40° incidence) configuration. Through analyses of the model simulated database, we developed a technique to estimate surface soil moisture. This technique includes two steps. First, it decomposes the total backscattering signals into two components - the surface scattering components (the bare surface backscattering signals attenuated by the overlaying vegetation layer) and the sum of the direct volume scattering components and surface-volume interaction components at different polarizations. From the model simulated data-base, our decomposition technique works quit well in estimation of the surface scattering components with RMSEs of 0.12, 0.25, and 0.55 dB for VV, HH, and VH polarizations, respectively. Then, we use the decomposed surface backscattering signals to estimate the soil moisture and the combined surface roughness and vegetation attenuation correction factors with all three polarizations. Test of this algorithm using all simulated data showed that an accuracy for the volumetric soil moisture estimation in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.6 % could be achievable.","L-band multi-polarization radar; Soil moisture","Backscattering; Computer simulation; Data reduction; Database systems; Heat radiation; Moisture; Polarization; Radar; L-band multi-polarization radar; Root mean square error (RMSE); Soil moisture; Surface backscattering; Soils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344403986

The novelty of the proposed model lies in its physiological relevance, whereby both small and medium latency sensory feedbacks from muscle spindle (MS), and force feedback from Golgi tendon organ (GTO) are included in the formulation. The biomechanical model also includes active and passive viscoelastic feedback from Hill-type muscle model and a second-order low-pass function for muscle activation. The central nervous system (CNS) regulation of postural movement is represented by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Padé approximation of delay terms is employed to arrive at an overall rational transfer function of the biomechanical model. The Hermite-Biehler theorem is then used to derive stability results, leading to the existence of stabilizing PID controllers. An algorithm for selection of stabilizing feedback gains is developed using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach.

The buried defect problem is broken into three separate components: a push inward to deliver the electromagnetic energy, a reflection calculation, and a push outward to propagate the reflections outside of the multilayer.

The modeling strategy combines the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and the transfer function estimation technique taking into account the effects of piezoelectric patches on the dynamics of the structures. To obtain the optimal actuator locations coupled with the control law, the linear quadric regulator (LQR) is chosen as a controller to achieve maximum structural vibration suppression with minimum control energy consumption, where the norm-2 of the LQR optimal feedback gain vector is set as the objective function of the optimization strategy. Due to their effectiveness in searching optimal design parameters and obtaining globally optimal solution, the Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied to find the optimal actuator configuration and placement among 8 possible configurations. Finally, several simulations are performed using the LQR with five typical actuators configurations including the optimal configuration given by the GAs. The results show that a substantial saving in the objective function as well as a significant vibration reduction can be obtained when the optimal configuration of the actuators is adopted.","Adaptive circular composite plate; Finite element method; Genetic algorithm; Linear quadric regulator; Model; Piezoelectric sensor/actuator optimal configuration; Vibration control; Zero-pole-gain","Adaptive circular composite plate; Linear quadratic regulator; Piezoelectric actuators; Zero-pole-gain model; Composite materials; Computer simulation; Feedback; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Piezoelectric devices; Plates (structural components); Vibration control; Actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844267710

Most approaches in the literature have focused either on finding a few strong regulatory patterns or on learning descriptive models from training data. However, these approaches are not yet adequate for making accurate predictions about which genes will be up- or down-regulated in new or held-out experiments. By introducing a predictive methodology for this problem, we can use powerful tools from machine learning and assess the statistical significance of our predictions. Results: We present a novel classification-based method for learning to predict gene regulatory response. Our approach is motivated by the hypothesis that in simple organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for predicting whether a gene is up- or down-regulated in a particular experiment based on (1) the presence of binding site subsequences ('motifs') in the gene's regulatory region and (2) the expression levels of regulators such as transcription factors in the experiment ('parents'). Thus, our learning task integrates two qualitatively different data sources: genome-wide cDNA microarray data across multiple perturbation and mutant experiments along with motif profile data from regulatory sequences. We convert the regression task of predicting real-valued gene expression measurements to a classification task of predicting +1 and -1 labels, corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond the levels of biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. The learning algorithm employed is boosting with a margin-based generalization of decision trees, alternating decision trees. This large-margin classifier is sufficiently flexible to allow complex logical functions, yet sufficiently simple to give insight into the combinatorial mechanisms of gene regulation. We observe encouraging prediction accuracy on experiments based on the Gasch S.cerevisiae dataset, and we show that we can accurately predict up- and down-regulation on held-out experiments. We also show how to extract significant regulators, motifs and motif-regulator pairs from the learned models for various stress responses. Our method thus provides predictive hypotheses, suggests biological experiments, and provides interpretable insight into the structure of genetic regulatory networks.

A globally distributed ground system will deliver 95 percent of the data within 26 minutes from the time of on-orbit collection.

These low-rank beamformers have a rank where the output SINR is maximized and a large drop in the output SINR can occur if the beamformer operates at an improper rank. Indirect Dominant Mode Rejection (IDMR) is proposed wherein one first employs a high-resolution spatial spectrum estimation technique to estimate the directions and powers of the dominant interferers. Subsequently, this information is used to construct an estimate of the signal-free (interference plus noise only) autocorrelation matrix (for a given look-direction.) In this process, any residual correlations between the interferers and the signal arriving from the look-direction due to finite sample averaging is effectively removed. Simulations reveal that IDMR yields a dramatic improvement in output SINR relative to CG and PCI/DMR, even when the latter operate at the optimal rank. In the case of correlated signals IDMR shows not to degrade the output SINR, different from CG and PCI/DMR.","Adaptive beamforming; IDMR; Low-rank beamforming; MVDR","Adaptive beamforming; Generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC); IDMR; Low-rank beamforming; Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR); Algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Gain control; Lagrange multipliers; Matrix algebra; Optical correlation; Optimization; Problem solving; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Spurious signal noise; Vectors; Adaptive optics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844269337

A decrease in the total number of on-target task completions was observed in microgravity compared with the ground performance for all tasks. The ratio between the total number of attempts and the number of completions was higher in microgravity. The amount of force introduced into the system was not significantly higher in microgravity. We conclude that although tasks are performed with much greater deliberation and work in microgravity, there is no barrier to accurate and effective laparoscopic surgery. © 2004 Excerpta Medica Inc.

As compared to the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm involves no additional explicit interpolation and eliminates the spatially-variant weighting factor. Therefore, it retains the spatial resolution and is less susceptible to data noise.

Students tend to focus on analyzing feedback control systems without understanding where the transfer functions of real life systems come from. This effect is exacerbated by textbooks in control systems, where authors often assume that variables such as moment of inertia, damping coefficients and gear ratios are readily available when determining the transfer function of a system. The purpose of this paper is to present a series of experiments with a geared dc motor which is coupled to a rotary potentiometer. In the first experiment, the students look at the impulse response of the motor to determine the transfer function of the motor. Since an ideal impulse function cannot be provided, the students provide a short duration pulse to the motor to approximate an impulse. The results of experimentally determining the transfer function can then be used in a software package, such as Matlab, to compare simulation results to hardware results. In the second experiment, the students build a position control system for the geared dc motor and again compare results with simulation results. Non-linear effects such as saturation of operational amplifiers can be considered as part of both hardware and simulation. Students are able to gain a wealth of understanding from these labs, whereby the transfer functions in the textbook become more than just numbers and variables.",,"Geared DC motors; Moment of inertia; Closed loop control systems; Computer simulation; Control system analysis; Damping; DC motors; Engineering education; Gears; Laplace transforms; Students; Teaching; Three term control systems; Time domain analysis; Transfer functions; Feedback control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5444245668

This microevolutionary adaptation is produced by a genetic element that combines the basic retroelement life cycle of transcription, reverse transcription and integration with site-directed, adenine-specific mutagenesis. Central to this process is a reverse transcriptase-mediated exchange between two repeats; one serving as a donor template (TR) and the other as a recipient of variable sequence information (VR)1. Here we describe the genetic basis for diversity generation. The directionality of information transfer is determined by a 21-base-pair sequence present at the 3′ end of VR. On the basis of patterns of marker transfer in response to variant selective pressures, we propose that a TR reverse transcript is mutagenized, integrated into VR as a single non-coding strand, and then partially converted to the parental VR sequence. This allows the diversity-generating system to minimize variability to the subset of bases under selection. Using the Bordetella phage cassette as a signature, we have identified numerous related elements in diverse bacteria.

We investigate a computational basis for failure of motor learning when there is no prior information about the system to be controlled and when it is not practical to perform a thorough random exploration of the set of possible commands. In this case, if the desired movement has never yet been performed, then it may not be possible to learn the correct motor commands since there will be no appropriate training examples. We derive the mathematical basis for this phenomenon when the controller can be modeled as a linear combination of nonlinear basis functions trained using a gradient descent learning rule on the observed commands and their results. We show that there are two failure modes for which continued training examples will never lead to improvement in performance. We suggest that this may provide a model for the lack of improvement in human skills that can occur despite repeated practice of a complex task.",,"article; biological model; comparative study; computer simulation; environment; human; learning; motor activity; nonlinear system; physiology; psychomotor performance; statistical model; Computer Simulation; Environment; Humans; Learning; Linear Models; Models, Neurological; Motor Activity; Nonlinear Dynamics; Practice (Psychology); Psychomotor Performance; Transfer (Psychology)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142686579

Intuition suggests these ""specialist"" neurons would be better suited to report this stimulus feature to higher visual centers than ""generalist"" neurons, neurons that broadly modulate their activity to the feature. However, as stimuli are encoded not by one cell but by large neural ensembles, we have studied the role of single-cell receptive field properties in stimulus representation. Using regression error statistics, we compared the performance of direction-of-motion estimators, using ensembles of neurons selectively responding to direction of motion and estimators using ensembles not specializing to direction. We found that direction-selective ensembles were no better at representing a bar's direction of motion than nonselective ensembles. Quite the opposite, the nonselective unit ensembles provided a better estimate of the direction (standard deviation of the error of 33°) than the direction-selective ensembles (standard deviation of the error of 42°). The nonselective neurons provided information through a latency code that is apparent only when a neuron's activity is considered in the context of the responses of neighboring neurons. These results suggest that models utilizing both generalist and specialist neurons may better reflect the encoding mechanisms that take place in sensory pathways.","Neural prosthetic; Neurological models; Visual prosthesis","Neural prosthetic; Neurological models; Sensory stimulus; Visual prosthesis; Error analysis; Fourier transforms; Neurology; Prosthetics; Sensory aids; Sensory perception; Signal processing; Vectors; Image coding; action potential; algorithm; animal; article; biological model; brain mapping; cat; comparative study; computer simulation; electroencephalography; evaluation; evoked visual response; methodology; movement perception; nerve cell network; photostimulation; physiology; sensory nerve cell; visual cortex; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Brain Mapping; Cats; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Models, Neurological; Motion Perception; Nerve Net; Neurons, Afferent; Photic Stimulation; Visual Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5444262454

Two new methods of measuring coherence between field potentials and EEG channels are proposed for modeling the level of linear association between channels during epileptic seizures. These methods rely upon modeling the repetitive clonic seizure activity as a sum of sinusoids with varying degrees of phase locking. Estimating the amplitude of sinusoids from correlation and cross-correlation time domain data, we can find the coherences from a ratio of these amplitudes. One method utilizes amplitude finding from the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) technique. The other method uses alterations in amplitude of individual sinusoids and their ratios in a matrix pencil equation formed from cross- and auto-correlation matrices. The corresponding generalized eigenvalues of these equations form the coherence ratios. This utilizes the estimation of signal parameters using rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm to arrive at coherence amplitude ratios. Simulations illustrate that the MUSIC method provides better noise immunity as it outperforms the conventional Fourier transform-based method for coherence estimation. Both coherence estimators reflect presence of sinusoidal components that are propagated or not propagated along a particular transmission pathway. We illustrate the value of both methods by examining the strength of correlation between seizure EEG from specific thalarnic nuclei and cortex in a rodent model of generalized epilepsy. The pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) chemoconvulsant model in rats reflects selective activation of the anterior thalamic nucleus. Using both methods, this neuronal element has much larger coherence with cortex than another thalamic region, the posterior thalamus (p < 0.05). These methods isolate the unique contribution of anterior thalamus in the formation of an ictal network and corroborate earlier conventional or periodogram techniques.","Coherence; Seizure epilepsy; Subspace; Thalamocortical","Ictal activity; Neuroanatomy; Partial coherence; Sinusoidal modeling; Coherent light; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Electroencephalography; Information analysis; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Signal detection; Drug products; algorithm; animal; article; biological model; biological rhythm; brain cortex; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; electroencephalography; epilepsy; evaluation; human; male; methodology; nerve tract; pathophysiology; periodicity; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; statistics; thalamus; validation study; Algorithms; Animals; Biological Clocks; Cerebral Cortex; Computer Simulation; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Periodicity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Statistics; Thalamus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5444230624

This study compared the efficacy of 2 supplemental, self-study methods for learning shoulder joint anatomy to determine which method provides for greater transfer of learning to the clinical setting. METHODS: Two groups of medical students studied shoulder joint anatomy using either a second-generation virtual reality surgical simulator or images from a textbook. They were then asked to identify anatomical structures of the shoulder joint as they appeared in a videotape of a live arthroscopic procedure. RESULTS: The mean identification scores, out of a possible score of 7, were 3.1 ± 1.3 for the simulator group and 2.9 ± 1.5 for the textbook group (P = 0.70). Student ratings of the 2 methods on a 5-point Likert scale were significantly different. The simulator group rated the simulator more highly as an effective learning tool than the textbook group rated the textbook (means of 3.2 ± 0.7 and 2.6 ± 0.5, respectively, P = 0.02). Furthermore, the simulator group indicated that they were more likely to use the simulator as a learning tool if it were available to them than the textbook group was willing to use the textbook (means of 4.0 ± 1.2 and 3.0 ± 0.9, respectively, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our results show that this surgical simulator is at least as effective as textbook images for learning anatomy and could enhance student learning through increased motivation. These findings provide insight into simulator development and strategies for learning anatomy. Possible explanations and future research directions are discussed.","Anatomy/*education/methods; Education, medical, *methods; Patient simulation; Textbooks","arthroscopic surgery; arthroscopy; article; clinical education; controlled study; human; joint; learning; medical informatics; simulator; surgical anatomy; virtual reality; Anatomy; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Technology; Humans; Shoulder; Teaching Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043114912

Knowledge of the biodynamic response (BR) of the human hand-arm system is an important part of the foundation for the measurement and assessment of hand-transmitted vibration exposure. This study investigated the BR of human fingers in a power grip subjected to a random vibration. Method. Ten male subjects were used in the experiment. Each subject applied three coupling actions to a simulated tool handle at three different finger grip force levels. Results and Conclusions. The BR is practically independent of the hand coupling actions for frequencies at or above 100 Hz. Above 50 Hz, the BR is correlated to finger and hand sizes. Increasing the finger coupling force significantly increases the BR. Therefore, hand forces should be measured and used when assessing hand-transmitted vibration exposure. The results also show that under a constant-velocity vibration, the finger vibration power absorption at frequencies above 200 Hz is approximately twice that at frequencies below 100 Hz. This suggests that the frequency weighting specified in the current ISO 5349-1 (2001) may underestimate the high frequency effect on vibration-induced finger disorders.",,"Computer simulation; Couplings; Electric frequency control; Vibration control; Biodynamic responses (BR); Coupling actions; Power grip; Vibration exposures; Dynamic response; adult; arm; article; biodynamic response; energy absorption; finger; finger disorder; force; grip strength; hand; hand disease; hand grip; health hazard; human; human experiment; male; measurement; mechanics; normal human; occupational exposure; simulation; velocity; vibration; vibration syndrome; Algorithms; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Energy Transfer; Fingers; Hand Strength; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Movement; Nonlinear Dynamics; Physical Stimulation; Posture; Random Allocation; Vibration; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6044235522

It is used to compute power deposition, driven current, momentum transfer, fueling, and other profiles in tokamak plasmas due to NBI. NUBEAM computes the time-dependent deposition and slowing down of the fast ions produced by NBI, taking into consideration beam geometry and composition, ion-neutral interactions (atomic physics), anomalous diffusion of fast ions, the effects of large scale instabilities, the effect of magnetic ripple, and finite Larmor radius effects. The NUBEAM module can also treat fusion product ions that contribute to alpha heating and ash accumulation, whether or not NBI is present. These physical phenomena are important in simulations of present day tokamaks and projections to future devices such as ITER. The NUBEAM module was extracted from the TRANSP integrated modeling code, using standards of the National Transport Code Collaboration (NTCC), and was submitted to the NTCC module library (http://w3.pppl.gov/NTCC). This paper describes the physical processes computed in the NUBEAM module, together with a summary of the numerical techniques that are used. The structure of the NUBEAM module is described, including its dependence on other NTCC library modules.

Although a number of biophysical burst mechanisms have been identified, the relationship between burst dynamics and information transfer is uncertain. Electrosensory pyramidal cells have a well defined backpropagation-dependent burst mechanism. We used in vivo, in vitro, and modeling approaches to investigate pyramidal cell responses to mimics of behaviorally relevant sensory input. We found that within a given spike train, bursts are biased toward low-frequency events while isolated spikes simultaneously code for the entire frequency range. We also demonstrated that burst dynamics are essential for optimal feature detection but are not required for stimulus estimation. We conclude that burst and spike dynamics can segregate a single spike train into two parallel and complementary streams of information transfer.","Burst; Dendritic backpropagation; Feature detection; Neural code; Sensory systems; Stimulus estimation","animal tissue; article; behavior; biophysics; brain slice; burst firing; controlled study; in vitro study; in vivo study; information system; nonhuman; priority journal; pyramidal nerve cell; sensory stimulation; sensory system electrophysiology; signal processing; spike; stimulus; stimulus response; Action Potentials; Afferent Pathways; Animals; Computer Simulation; Electric Stimulation; Gymnotiformes; Models, Neurological; Normal Distribution; Pyramidal Cells; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342668030

It is caused by mutations in one of 3 voltage-gated sodium channel subunit genes (SCN1B, SCN1A, and SCN2A) and the GABA A receptor γ2 subunit gene (GBRG2). The biophysical characterization of 3 mutations (T875M, W1204R, and R1648H) in SCN1A, the gene encoding the CNS voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit Na v1.1, demonstrated a variety of functional effects. The T875M mutation enhanced slow inactivation, the W1204R mutation shifted the voltage dependency of activation and inactivation in the negative direction, and the R1648H mutation accelerated recovery from inactivation. To determine how these changes affect neuronal firing, we used the NEURON simulation software to design a computational model based on the experimentally determined properties of each GEFS+ mutant sodium channel and a delayed rectifier potassium channel. The model predicted that W1204R decreased the threshold, T875M increased the threshold, and R1648H did not affect the threshold for firing a single action potential. Despite the different effects on the threshold for firing a single action potential, all of the mutations resulted in an increased propensity to fire repetitive action potentials.

It is accomplished by using a laser or ultrasound noninvasively to transfer energy to a desired target causing tissue damage. This process has two potential benefits to medical professionals: simplicity of procedure and safety to patient. However, optimizing these selective interactions is difficult due to the number of variables. We propose an optimization coefficient relating the dynamic and geometric parameters of selective hyperthermia, and proceed to measure it in an experimental setup consisting of a nearinfrared laser and laser-absorbing dye. To simulate tissue, gelatin phantoms are created using a combination of water, intralipid, and gelatin. Our experiments use a 1.00-cm-diam spherical phantom that is homogeneously enhanced with an indocyanine green (ICG) solution and placed inside a nontarget phantom and irradiated by an 805-nm diode laser. Temperature measurements taken at different locations are analyzed so optimization coefficients can be calculated for different parameters. This optimization coefficient compares the difference in temperatures from inside and outside the target. Analysis of the values after thermal equilibrium provides information about the best parameter selection. Our findings indicate that the optimal ICG concentration and power combination for our tested parameters are 0.083% and 0.97 W, respectively. Based on our analysis, optimization can be obtained by using this coefficient to compare the selectivity of several parameter combinations. © 2004 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Indocyanine green; Near-infrared laser; Optimization; Selective hyperthermia","Diseases; Irradiation; Laser applications; Noninvasive medical procedures; Optimization; Tissue; Indocyanine green; Selective hyperthermia; Biomedical engineering; gelatin; article; biological model; body temperature; chemistry; comparative study; computer assisted therapy; computer simulation; evaluation; heat; hyperthermic therapy; laser surgery; methodology; physiology; quality control; radiation exposure; thermal conductivity; thermography; validation study; Body Temperature; Computer Simulation; Gelatin; Heat; Hyperthermia, Induced; Laser Surgery; Models, Biological; Quality Control; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Thermal Conductivity; Thermography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942715268

Because of the intrinsic complexity of biological organisms, only the simplest cells will allow complete definition of all components and their interactions. The theoretical and experimental construction of a minimal cell has been suggested as a tool to develop such an understanding. Our ultimate goal is to convert a ""coarse-grain"" lumped parameter computer model of Escherichia coli into a genetically and chemically detailed model of a ""minimal cell."" The base E. coli model has been converted into a generalized model of a heterotrophic bacterium. This coarse-grain minimal cell model is functionally complete, with growth rate, composition, division, and changes in cell morphology as natural outputs from dynamic simulations where only the initial composition of the cell and of the medium are specified. A coarse-grain model uses pseudochemical species (or modules) that are aggregates of distinct chemical species that share similar chemistry and metabolic dynamics. This model provides a framework in which these modules can be ""delumped"" into chemical and genetic descriptions while maintaining connectivity to all other functional elements. Here we demonstrate that a detailed description of nucleotide precursors transport and metabolism is successfully integrated into the whole-cell model. This nucleotide submodel requires fewer (12) genes than other theoretical predictions in minimal cells. The demonstration of modularity suggests the possibility of developing modules in parallel and recombining them into a fully functional chemically and genetically detailed model of a prokaryote cell.",,"adenylate kinase; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; purine; pyrimidine; article; Bacillus cereus; cell function; cell volume; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae; mathematical model; Mycoplasma; Mycoplasma genitalium; nonhuman; nucleotide transport; priority journal; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; RNA analysis; Adenylate Kinase; Biological Transport; Escherichia coli; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase; Purines; Pyrimidines; Bacillus cereus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Haemophilus; Haemophilus influenzae; Mycoplasma; Mycoplasma genitalium; Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342469474

Wong, M.G. Gouda, S.S. Lam, Secure group communications using key graphs, in: Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM '98, September 1998, pp. 68-79] to a large number of users efficiently using multicast. For reliable delivery, Keystone [C.K. Wong, S.S. Lam, Keystone: a group key management system, in: Proceedings of International Conference on Telecommunications, Acapulco, Mexico, May 2000] proposed the use of forward error correction (FEC) in an initial multicast, followed by the use of unicast delivery for users that cannot recover their new keys from the multicast. In this paper, we investigate how to limit unicast recovery to a small fraction r of the user population. By specifying a very small r, almost all users in the group will receive their new keys within a single multicast round. We present analytic models for deriving r as a function of the amount of FEC redundant information (denoted by h) and the rekeying interval duration (denoted by T) for both Bernoulli and two-state Markov Chain loss models. From our analyses, we conclude that r decreases roughly at an exponential rate as h increases. We then present a protocol designed to adaptively adjust (h,T) to achieve a specified r. In particular, our protocol chooses from among all feasible (h,T) pairs one with h and T values close to their feasible minima. Our protocol also adapts to an increase in network traffic. Simulation results using ns-2 show that with network congestion our adaptive FEC protocol can still achieve a specified r by adjusting values of h and T. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

An important design parameter is the depth of the de-jitter buffer since it influences two important parameters controlling voice quality, namely voice-path delay and packet loss probability. In this paper, we propose and study several schemes for optimally adjusting the depth of the de-jitter buffer. In addition to de-jitter-buffer depth adjustments within a call, the initial value and rates of changes of the de-jitter buffer depth are allowed to depend on the class of the call and are adaptively adjusted (upwards or downwards) for every new call based on voice-path delay and packet loss probability measurements over one or more previous calls. Parameter adjustments are geared towards either (a) minimizing voice-path delay while maintaining a packet loss probability objective, or (b) maximizing R-factor, an objective measure of voice quality that depends both on the voice-path delay and the packet loss probability. Using simulation models and measured packet delay traces, it is shown that adaptive schemes perform better than static ones and adaptive schemes with learning perform better than ones without learning. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The transformation from visual to hand-centered coordinates requires the learning of a task-specific reference frame and scaling factor. We studied learning of a novel reference frame by imposing a screen-cursor rotation and learning of a scaling factor by imposing a novel gain. Previous work demonstrates that rotation and gain learning have different time courses and patterns of generalization. Here we used PET to identify and compare brain areas activated during rotation and gain learning, with a baseline motor-execution task as the subtracted control. Previous work has shown that the time courses of rotation and gain adaptation have a short rapid phase followed by a longer slow phase. We therefore also sought to compare activations associated with the rapid and slower phases of adaptation. We isolated the rapid phase by alternating opposite values of the rotation or gain every 16 movements. The rapid phase of rotation adaptation activated the preSMA. More complete adaptation to the rotation activated right ventral premotor cortex, right posterior parietal cortex, and the left lateral cerebellum. The rapid phase of gain learning only activated subcortical structures: bilateral putamen and left cerebellum. More complete gain learning failed to show any significant activation. We conclude that the time course of rotation adaptation is paralleled by a frontoparietal shift in activated cortical regions. In contrast, early gain adaptation involves only subcortical structures, which we suggest reflects a more automatic process of contextual recalibration of a scaling factor.",,"adaptation; adult; article; brain cortex; brain depth stimulation; brain region; cerebellum; controlled study; frontal cortex; human; human experiment; learning; male; normal human; parietal lobe; positron emission tomography; premotor cortex; priority journal; putamen; rotation; task performance; visuomotor coordination; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Learning; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842284621

A hyperelastic Mooney-Rivlin model is used to implement the experimentally measured nonlinear elastic properties of the tube wall. A 36.5% pre-axial stretch is applied to make the simulation physiological. The Navier-Stokes equations in curvilinear form are used for the fluid model. Our results indicate that severe stenosis causes critical flow conditions, high tensile stress, and considerable compressive stress in the stenosis plaque which may be related to artery compression and plaque cap rupture.

Time-resolved photon migration imaging (TPMI) measures a temporal point spread function (TPSF) of light diffusing through a turbid medium. The temporal profile can generally provide more useful information for accurate image reconstruction than continuous wave (CW) and frequency domain (FD) measurements, providing that adequate signal to noise ratio has been achieved. Currently measurement of TPSF is most commonly realized with the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Nonetheless, the principle of single photon counting requires that no more than one photon is detected in each cycle. This usually results in a too long data acquisition time, or a rather low signal to noise ratio in a short time. We propose a more efficient coded excitation and correlation detection mechanism that borrows ideas from spread spectrum communications. A train of excitation pulses modulated by a pseudo-random bit sequence is used as the light source, while a cross-correlation scheme is used to retrieve the impulse response. We have simulated a TPMI system and evaluated its performance. It has been demonstrated that the data acquisition time can be reduced by several orders, in comparison with a TCSPC system.","Photon migration imaging; Pseudo-random bit sequence; Single photon counting; Spread spectrum; Time-resolved","Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Light sources; Optical transfer function; Photons; Signal to noise ratio; Spread spectrum communication; Tomography; Turbidity; Temporal point spread function; Time-correlated single photon counting technique; Time-resolved photon migration imaging; Imaging systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345714889

The stepper motor is used to position a valve in an airflow process simulator and this actuator module now allows standard PID controllers to be used to control the airflow in the simulator. It is also now possible to use PLCs that don't have stepper motor commands as part of their PID algorithm. However, by using digital signal processing techniques in the module, it is now possible to simulate actuator delays and time constants. To help appreciate different actuator responses, it is also possible to replace the stepper motor actuator with a pneumatic actuator. This simulation system enables students to modify an actuator's transfer function without destroying the realism of a hands-on simulator.

Applications Directorate, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529, United States","Light emerging from the sea surface carries information of the water constituents. General empirical methods to derive in-water ocean color algorithms use measurements near the sea surface to relate the emerging radiative signals to the water contents. Problems with existing algorithms are frequently reported and there is no single algorithm adopted for Case 2 waters. There is a general trend in investigators moving from pure empirical methods to model-based techniques to solve the inverse problem. Among these techniques, the non-linear optimization approach (NOA) offers the highest accuracy without any dependency on the simulated or training data, but generally requires substantial computation time. Our research presents an approach to substantially decrease the computation time of the NOA by using a look-up-table (LUT) technique to correct the effects of inelastic scattering. A series of sensitivity tests was made to determine the critical factors required to accurately simulate the remote sensing reflectance. Results show that the inherent optical properties (IOPs) and inelastic scattering play a significant role, while variations of the ambient optical environment and surface wind speed are negligible. A LUT was then derived from numerous forward simulations using the Hydrolight radiative transfer model. All processes of inelastic scattering were considered and a set of three-variable (chlorophyll concentration, CDOM ratio and backscattering fraction) biooptical models, was used to yield a flexible parameterization of IOPs. This new approach was validated against in situ measurements. To examine its application to a large variety of water types, an extensive model-to-model comparison was made for a wide range of combinations of IOPs. Results show that our model provides both fast and accurate retrievals of chlorophyll concentration, CDOM ratio and backscattering fraction for an optically homogeneous water body. This new inversion approach may accelerate the use of ocean color remote sensing.","Inversion; Look-up-table; Non-linear optimization; Ocean color; Radiative transfer","Acoustic wave backscattering; Acoustic wave reflection; Chlorophyll; Computer simulation; Oceanography; Optical engineering; Radiation effects; Look-up-table; Non-linear optimization; Ocean color; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342467483

It is therefore natural to seek to improve image resolution by increasing the size of the collection aperture of a remote sensing system. On the other hand, as aperture size increases it becomes technically more difficult, and financially much more expensive, to maintain a figure quality that holds geometrical aberrations to a level that is negligible compared to diffraction effects. This paper presents an analysis of an approach that combines active optics with what has been called a post-detection phase diversity technique (R. A. Gonsalves, ""Phase retrieval and diversity in adaptive optics"", Opt. Eng. 21, 829-832 (1982)). The basic concept is to allow for variable focus as an inherent system capability, in order to acquire multiple defocused images, each one of which has slightly different, and complementary, spatial frequency content. The proper deconvolution and merging of these images produces a composite image that is superior to the image that can be acquired at any single focal setting.

Although SVMs are generated without the use of user-specified models, required hyperparameters, such as Gaussian kernel width, are usually user-specified and/or experimentally derived. This effort presents an alternative approach for the selection of the Gaussian kernel width via analysis of the distributional characteristics of the training data projected on the 'trained' SVM (margin values). The efficacy of a particular kernel width can be visually determined via one-dimensional density estimate plots of the training data margin values. Projecting the data onto the SVM hyperplane allows the one-dimensional analysis of the data from the viewpoint of the 'trained' SVM. The effect of kernel parameter selection on class-conditional margin distributions is demonstrated in the one-dimensional projection subspace, and a criterion for unsupervised optimization of kernel width is discussed. Empirical results are given for two classification problems: the 'toy' checkerboard problem and a high dimensional classification problem using simulated High-Resolution Radar (HRR) targets projected into a wavelet packet feature space.","Classification; High resolution radar; Parameter optimization; Support vector machines; Wavelet packets","Ballistics; Estimation; Feature extraction; Lagrange multipliers; Learning systems; Missiles; Optimization; Regression analysis; Vectors; Parzen kernel density; Support vector machines (SVM); Wavelet packets; Radar target recognition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344082813

The UML provides many modeling diagrams and constructs used to aid the design and development of objected-oriented systems. Each UML diagram presents a unique view of the object-oriented system under design. The most common UML modeling diagram is the Class Diagram. Classes represent the modeling framework from which all object-oriented systems are designed. They are the ""blueprints"" of object-oriented systems, defining the attributes and behaviors of objects, which in turn, provide the functionality of object-oriented systems. A typical class diagram groups logically-related classes together to show the relationships of the classes to one another. Since it is highly likely that programming students will encounter the UML in industry, it is imperative that computer science and computer engineering technology instructors begin to introduce students to the UML in their object-oriented programming courses. This tutorial is designed for just that purpose. The tutorial introduces the UML Class Diagram-its syntax and constructs. Specifically, seven methods expressing the relationships between classes are examined through detailed examples and pictorials. Students will learn how to model class diagrams using associations, association classes, aggregations, compositions, generalizations, realizations, and dependencies. Using this tutorial, programming instructors can quickly teach the fundamentals of UML class diagrams to their students. Students can use the tutorial as reference material as they develop class diagrams for their own objected-oriented programs.",,"Class diagrams; Computer engineering technology; Object-oriented systems; Unified modeling languages (UML); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Computer programming languages; Computer simulation; Students; Subroutines; Object oriented programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744253812

As a result, these efforts have not been able to bring multi-agent simulations into the mainstream of the analysis community. In this paper a mission-level agent-based simulation of the U-Boat war in the Bay of Biscay between German U-Boats and Allied aircraft is presented.

By fixing external geometry, the number of identical stages within the domain is varied until a minimal mass design is achieved. For the deployment phase, a new method is introduced which determines the tendon force inputs from a set of admissible, non-saturating inputs, that will reconfigure each kinematically invertible unit along its own path in minimum time. The approach utilizes the existence conditions and solution of a linear algebra problem that describe how the set of admissible tendon forces is mapped onto the set of path-dependent torques. Since this mapping is not one-to-one, free parameters in the control law always exist. An infinity-norm minimization with respect to these free parameters is responsible for saturation avoidance. In addition to the required time to deploy, the expended control energy during the post-movement phase is also minimized with respect to the total number of stages. Conditions under which these independent minimizations yield the same robot illustrate the importance of considering control/structure interaction within this new robotics paradigm.",,"Actuators; Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Elastic moduli; Feedback control; Kinematics; Linear algebra; Productivity; Robotics; Tendons; Structural complexity; Tensegrity systems; Intelligent structures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242609963

Recent Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) studies have shown that the application of a transversely acting, traveling waveform like force, that is confined to the viscous sublayer of the flow, can result in significant reduction in turbulent drag. Since the action of this force wave is confined to a very small region of fluid right next to the surface, it is postulated that the application of a traveling surface wave, which is also confined to these dimensions, would in effect result in the necessary traveling force wave. In this work, a generalized actuation principle for generating a traveling wave on the surface of a skin is proposed and analyzed. The flow control technique pursued is ""micro"" in the sense that only micro-scale wave amplitudes (order of 30 μ m) and energy inputs are expected to produce significant benefits. Hence, a MEMS based approach to the design of the active skin is considered, that utilizes actuation by active materials such as Shape Memory Alloys (SMA)s and piezoelectric actuators. Specifically, a MEMS based design that incorporates thin film SMA actuators is developed and the process flow methodology required for its microfabrication is discussed. For preliminary testing and validation of the DNS results, a mechanically actuated prototype skin, the operation of which has been refined through several iterations, has been manufactured using a rapid prototyping machine.","Active Skin; Actuator; Microfabrication; Piezoelectric materials; Shape Memory Alloys; Turbulent Drag","Computer simulation; Drag; Flow control; Fuel consumption; Microelectromechanical devices; Piezoelectric devices; Shape memory effect; Turbulent flow; Microfabrication; Fluid dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242636214

Martinos C., Charlestown, MA 02446, United States","Identification of spatiotemporal interactions within/between neuron populations is critical for detection and characterization of large-scale neuronal interactions underlying perception, cognition, and behavior. Univariate analysis has been employed successfully in many neuroimaging studies. However, univariate analysis does not explicitly test for interactions between distributed areas of activity and is not sensitive to distributed responses across the brain. Multivariate analysis can explicitly test for multiple statistical models, including the designed paradigm, and allows for spatial and temporal model detection. Here, we investigate multivariate analysis approaches that take into consideration the 4D (time and space) covariance structure of the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are two popular multivariate approaches with distinct mathematical constraints. Common difficulties in using these two different decompositions include the following: classification of the revealed components (task-related signal versus noise), overall signal-to-noise sensitivity, and the relatively low computational efficiency (multivariate analysis requires the entire raw data set and more time for model identification analysis). Using both Monte Carlo simulations and empirical data, we derived and tested the generalized partial least squares (gPLS) framework, which can incorporate both PCA and ICA decompositions with computational efficiency. The gPLS method explicitly incorporates the experimental design to simplify the identification of characteristic spatiotemporal patterns. We performed parametric modeling studies of a blocked-design experiment under various conditions, including background noise distribution, sampling rate, and hemodynamic response delay. We used a randomized grouping approach to manipulate the degrees of freedom of PCA and ICA in gPLS to characterize both paradigm coherent and transient brain responses. Simulation data suggest that in the gPLS framework, PCA mostly outperforms ICA as measured by the receiver operating curves (ROCs) in SNR from 0.01 to 100, the hemodynamic response delays from 0 to 3 TR in fMRI, background noise models of Guassian, sub-Gaussian, and super-Gaussian distributions and the number of observations from 5, 10, to 20 in each block of a six-block experiment. Further, due to selective averaging, the gPLS method performs robustly in low signal-to-noise ratio (<1) experiments. We also tested PCA and ICA using PLS in a simulated event-related fMRI data to show their similar detection. Finally, we tested our gPLS approach on empirical fMRI motor data. Using the randomized grouping method, we are able to identify both transient responses and consistent paradigm/model coherent components in the 10-epoch block design motor fMRI experiment. Overall, studies of synthetic and empirical data suggest that PLS analysis, using PCA decomposition, provides a stable and powerful tool for exploration of fMRI/behavior data. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Extending a similar concept to a hypothetical full-field 25×33 mm2 mask area containing 20 nm gate CDs shows that CD compensation, while computationally demanding, can be realized through a convolution approach of a 1×1 mm2 mask area using a non-uniform adaptive grid.","Adaptive grid; CD compensation; CD control; Convolution; Engineering test stand (ETS); Flare; Flare point-spread function (PSF); Light scatter; Mask density change","Computer simulation; Light scattering; Masks; Optical transfer function; Optics; Standards; Ultraviolet radiation; Critical dimension compensation; Critical dimension control; Extreme ultraviolet masks; Flare compensation; Flare point-spread function; Mask critical dimension resizing; Photolithography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141459709

Indeed, oscillations in thalamic slices resemble SWD when intra-RE inhibition is blocked and are suppressed when intra-RE inhibition is enhanced. To elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying these network changes, we recorded from RE cells during oscillations in thalamic slices and either blocked intra-RE inhibition with picrotoxin or enhanced it with clonazepam. We found that intra-RE inhibition limits the number and synchrony, but not the duration, of RE cell bursts. We then performed simulations that demonstrate how inhibition can shift network activity into a desynchronized mode simply by vetoing occasional RE cell bursts. In contrast, when intra-RE inhibition is blocked, RE cells burst synchronously, enabling even short RE cell bursts to promote epileptogenesis in two ways: first, by activating GABAB receptors, and second, through the GABAB receptor-independent emergence of network synchrony.","Computational modeling; GABAA receptors; Generalized absence epilepsy; Oscillations; Spike wave discharge; Thalamus","4 aminobutyric acid B receptor; clonazepam; picrotoxin; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell activity; cell interaction; cell synchronization; controlled study; epilepsy; epileptogenesis; GABAergic transmission; nerve cell; nerve cell network; neurotransmission; nonhuman; oscillation; priority journal; rat; spike wave; thalamus; thalamus nucleus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141753015

McGill's concept expresses the information shared by all of K random variables, while the multi-information expresses the information shared by any two or more of them. Partly to avoid confusion with the multi-information. I call his concept here the co-information. Co-informations, oddly, can be negative. They form a partially ordered set, or lattice, as do the entropies. Entropies and co-informations are simply and symmetrically related by Mobius inversion [12]. The co-inform-action lattice sheds light on the problem of approximating ing a joint density with a set of marginal densities, though as usual we run into the partition function. Since the marginals correspond to higher-order edges in Bayesian hypergraphs, this approach motivates new algorithms such as Dependent Component Analysis, which we describe, and (loopy) Generalised Belief Propagation on hypergraphs, which we do not.

The simulation uses an analytical expression or ray-tracing to generate projection sets of breast phantoms at 1 keV intervals dictated by the input x-ray energy spectra. The x-ray focal spot was modeled as having a Gaussian distribution. The detector was modeled as an amorphous silicon (aSi:H) flat-panel imager that uses a structured CsI scintillator. Noise propagation through the detector was simulated by modeling statistical variations of the projection images at each energy interval as a scaled Poisson process. Scintillator blurring was simulated by using an empirically determined modulation transfer function. After introducing noise and detector blur, projection sets simulated at each energy were then combined and reconstructed using Feldkamp's cone-beam reconstruction algorithm. Using this framework, the effects of a number of acquisition and reconstruction parameters can be investigated.

However, little has been done to substantiate the impact of these quantitative image quality metrics on a detector's utility for specific clinical tasks. In order to simulate the effects of these physical parameters, image modification routines were developed capable of modifying a perfect input image to the resolution and noise characteristics specified by an input MTF and input NPS and included sampling effects such as aliasing. Experimental verification of these routines showed excellent correspondence between the resolution and noise properties of the output images and the input NPS and MTF curves. In order to investigate the effect of noise and resolution on signal detection tasks, high-quality images containing simulated lesions are altered by the image modification routines to the resolution and noise properties of two commercial digital radiographic detectors, one direct and one indirect. The sets of modified images had noise properties consistent with acquisitions at comparable, clinically relevant exposures for the two detectors.

It reconstructs epicardial potentials, electrograms, and isochrones from electrocardiographic body-surface potentials noninvasively. Current ECGI methodology employs Tikhonov regularization, which imposes constraints on the reconstructed potentials or their derivatives. This approach can sometimes reduce spatial resolution by smoothing the solution. Accuracy depends on a priori knowledge of solution characteristics and determination of an optimal regularization parameter. These properties led us to implement an independent, iterative approach for ECGI - the generalized minimal residual (GMRes) method - which does not apply constraints. GMRes was applied to experimental data using activation/repolarization of normal and infarcted hearts. GMRes reconstructions were compared to Tikhonov reconstructions and to measured ""gold standards"" in isolated hearts. Overall, the accuracy of GMRes solutions was similar to Tikhonov regularization. However, in certain cases GMRes recovered localized potential features (e.g., multiple potential minima), which were lost in the Tikhonov solution. Simultaneous use of these two complementary methods in clinical ECGI will ensure reliability and maximal extraction of diagnostic information in the absence of a priori information about a patient's condition.","Electrocardiographic inverse problem; Noninvasive arrhythmia diagnosis; Tikhonov regularization","Bioelectric potentials; Cardiovascular system; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer simulation; Diseases; Electrophysiology; Image reconstruction; Inverse problems; Noninvasive medical procedures; Generalized minimal residual method; Infarcted heart; Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging; Tkhonov solution; Electrocardiography; action potential; algorithm; animal; article; biological model; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; dog; electrocardiography; evaluation; heart infarction; heart muscle conduction system; heart pacing; heart ventricle tachycardia; innervation; methodology; pathophysiology; pericardium; validation study; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Body Surface Potential Mapping; Cardiac Pacing, Artificial; Computer Simulation; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Dogs; Electrocardiography; Heart Conduction System; Models, Cardiovascular; Models, Neurological; Myocardial Infarction; Pericardium; Tachycardia, Ventricular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042878627

Plasticity of this synapse has been extensively studied, albeit primarily with individual action potentials elicited at low frequencies. Yet, the mechanosensory neurons fire high-frequency bursts in response to even moderate tactile stimuli delivered to the skin. In the present study, we extend this analysis to show that sensory neurons also fire bursts in the range of 1-60 Hz in response to electrical stimuli similar to those used in behavioral studies of sensitization. Intracellular stimulation of sensory neurons to fire a burst of action potentials at 10 Hz for 1 secled to significant homosynaptic depression of postsynaptic responses. The depression was transient and fully recovered within 10 min. During the burst, the steady-state depressed phase of the postsynaptic response, which was only 20% of the initial EPSP of the burst, still contributed to firing the motor neuron. To explore the fiinctional contribution of transient homosynaptic depression to the response of the motor neuron, computer simulations of the sensorimotor synapse with and without depression were compared. Depression allowed the motor neuron to produce graded responses over a wide range of presynaptic input strength. In addition, enhancement of synaptic transmission throughout a burst increased motor neuron output substantially more than did preferential enhancement of the initial phase of a burst. Thus, synaptic depression increased the dynamic range of the sensorimotor synapse and can, in principle, have a profound effect on information processing.","Burst; Depression; Facilitation; Modulation; Synaptic filtering; Synaptic plasticity","action potential; animal tissue; Aplysia; article; central nervous system depression; computer simulation; controlled study; electrostimulation; excitatory postsynaptic potential; information processing; mathematical computing; motoneuron; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; nonhuman; postsynaptic potential; priority journal; sensitization; sensorimotor cortex; sensory nerve cell; steady state; synapse; synaptic transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141521718

The ability to maintain smooth pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target provides a way to assess pursuit properties in the absence of visual inputs. To study the long-term effects of learning on nonvisual signals for pursuit, we used an operant conditioning procedure. By providing a reinforcing auditory stimulus during periods of accurate tracking, we increased the pursuit velocity gain during target blanking from 0.59 in the baseline session to 0.89 after 8 to 10 daily sessions of training. Learning also reduced the occurrence of saccades. The learned effects generalized to untrained target velocities and persisted in the presence of a textured visual background. In a yoked-control group, the reinforcer was independent of the subjects' responses, and the velocity gain remained unchanged (from 0.6 to 0.63, respectively, before and after training). In a control group that received no reinforcer, gain increased slightly after repetition of the task (from 0.63 to 0.71, respectively, before and after training). Using a model of pursuit, we show that these effects of learning can be simulated by modifying the gain of an extra-retinal signal. Our results demonstrate that learned contingencies can increase eye velocity in the absence of visual signals and support the view that pursuit is regulated by extra-retinal signals that can undergo long-term plasticity.",,"adaptation; adult; article; auditory stimulation; eye movement; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; normal human; priority journal; reinforcement; smooth pursuit eye movement; statistical analysis; visuomotor coordination; voluntary movement; Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Auditory Perception; Cerebral Cortex; Conditioning, Operant; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Neuronal Plasticity; Photic Stimulation; Pursuit, Smooth; Saccades; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042817883

In the present work, we studied an object manipulation task involving no arm movement to determine how subjects internally represent the force-motion relationship of an object during a skilled manipulation task. Human subjects learned to balance a simulated inverted pendulum. The simulation was controlled by pressing on a fixed force sensor, and applied forces resulted in motion of the simulated pendulum on a computer screen according to its equation of motion. Each subject initially learned the task in one arm posture and was tested 1 d later in a new arm posture. In one test condition, the effects of arm torque were matched to the original task, and in the other test condition, the simulation was unchanged. The pattern of skill transfer to different arm postures suggested that subjects had learned joint torque responses rather than a general model of the object interface forces. A second experiment showed that the advantage of training with matched arm torques was object specific, because torque-matched training on a tracking task involving similar forces was not a substitute for training in the balancing task.","Balancing; Human; Internal model; Isometric force; Motor skills; Object manipulation","adult; arm movement; article; body posture; computer; controlled study; female; force; human; human experiment; isometric exercise; learning; male; motor performance; object manipulation; priority journal; sensor; simulation; task performance; torque; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038078524

This paper presents a method for analyzing feedback-based protocols with a Web-user-like input traffic where the source alternates between 'transfer' periods followed by 'think' periods. Our key results, which are presented for the TCP protocol, are as follows: (1) When the round-trip time is the same for all users, the goodputs and the fraction of time that the system has some given number of transferring sources are insensitive to the distributions of transfer (file or page) sizes and think times except through the ratio of their means. Thus, apart from network round-trip times, only the ratio of average transfer sizes and think times of users need be known to size the network for achieving a specific quality of service. (2) The Engset model can be adapted to accurately compute goodputs for TCP and TCP over ATM, with different buffer management schemes. Though only these adaptations are given in the paper, the method based on the Engset model can be applied to analyze other feedback systems, such as ATM ABR, by finding a protocol specific adaptation. Hence, the method we develop is useful not only for analyzing TCP using a source model significantly different from the commonly used persistent sources, but also can be useful for analyzing other feedback schemes. (3) Comparisons of simulated TCP traffic to measured Ethernet traffic shows qualitatively similar second order autocorrelation when think times follow a Pareto distribution with infinite variance. Also, the simulated and measured traffic have long range dependence. In this sense our traffic model, which purports to be Web-user-like, also agrees with measured data traffic. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This property of TCP is due to its congestion control algorithm, which adapts to self-similar fluctuations on several timescales. The mechanisms and limitations of this propagation are investigated. It is demonstrated that if a TCP connection shares a bottleneck link with a self-similar background traffic flow, it propagates the correlation structure of the background traffic flow asymptotically, above a characteristic timescale. The cut-off timescale depends on the end-to-end path properties, e.g. round-trip time and average window size, and the receiver window size in case of high-speed connections. It is also shown that even short TCP connections can propagate long-range correlations effectively. In case when TCP encounters several bottleneck hops, the end-user perceived end-to-end traffic is also long-range dependent and it is characterized by the largest Hurst exponent. Through simple examples, it is shown that self-similarity of one TCP stream can be passed on to other TCP streams that it is multiplexed with. The limitations of propagation depend on network conditions. Propagation complements the widespread scaling phenomena reported in the literature. Our arguments are supported with a combination of analytic techniques, simulations and statistical analyzes of a number of wide area Internet traffic measurements. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The motivation for this proposal lies in supporting traffic flows such as VBR or associated with rate adaptive applications. Such traffic requires a minimal guaranteed bandwidth, but can see improved performance when sharing excess bandwidth not used to meet guarantees. The key idea underlying our approach is to route traffic flows so that they see minimal expected flow-perceived loads during their sojourn in the network. To this end we establish a routing framework where links estimate and advertise the parameters associated with their load dynamics in addition to their current load. New flows are routed based on this information and prior knowledge of their holding times so as to minimize the expected flow-perceived load. Simulations of this routing scheme in a (weighted) max-min bandwidth sharing framework show gains of 20-50% in the average flow bandwidth share over baseline routing schemes. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

For populations experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log variance versus log mean abundance gives a line with a slope of 2. Despite this expectation, most species have slopes of less than 2 (refs 2-4), indicating that more abundant populations of a species are relatively less variable than expected on the basis of simple statistical grounds. What causes abundant populations to be less variable has received considerable attention, but an explanation for the generality of this pattern is still lacking. Here we suggest a novel explanation for the scaling of temporal variability in population abundances. Using stochastic simulation and analytical models, we demonstrate how negative interactions among species in a community can produce slopes of Taylor's power law of less than 2, like those observed in real data sets. This result provides an example in which the population dynamics of single species can be understood only in the context of interactions within an ecological community.",,"Ecology; Simulation; Spatial variance; Biodiversity; interspecific interaction; population dynamics; population ecology; power law; temporal variation; article; chronobiology; correlation analysis; ecology; environmental factor; nonhuman; population abundance; population dynamics; priority journal; species difference; stochastic model; Animals; Competitive Behavior; Computer Simulation; Ecology; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037422075

This research combines several theoretical views of the interaction process into a hybrid model. Based on this model, a software tool was produced that allows engineers to model the human interaction process within their design. The system then provides feedback on the interaction process through items such as: the amount of mental effort required by a user, the degree to which the system conforms to human capabilities, the expected time to complete the interaction, where potential human error may occur, as well as potential misunderstandings or points of confusion to the users. The designer may then use this information to improve the design of the system. Validation of this technique indicates that the hybrid model produces accurate predictions of usability attributes and that the technique transfers from the laboratory to the real world.","Human - computer interaction design; Predictive performance models; Usability","Computer aided software engineering; Costs; Feedback; Interfaces (computer); Man machine systems; Designers; Ergonomics; access to information; analytical error; article; computer aided design; computer interface; computer program; engineering and technology; ergonomics; feedback system; human; human computer interaction; hybrid; laboratory; mental capacity; operator; prediction; process design; research; theoretical model; validation process; adult; bioengineering; computer interface; computer language; computer simulation; female; male; man machine interaction; physiology; questionnaire; reaction time; systems theory; task performance; validation study; Adult; Computer Simulation; Female; Human Engineering; Humans; Male; Man-Machine Systems; Programming Languages; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Software; Systems Theory; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037440147

The study was also designed to determine whether the impact of the visual and auditory cues can be isolated during diagnosis of the hazard. In a study that included 40 participants, results show that trained observers can perceive more correctly a hazardous condition which is different from what one would predict based on psychophysics. The results also show that trained participants relied strongly on the auditory cues to diagnose the potential hazard and risk correctly whereas the untrained participants who had access to both auditory and visual senses perceived the potential hazard more incorrectly than those trained and more similarly to a traditional Stevens' psychophysical curve. Untrained subjects who had only auditory input had the most difficulty in distinguishing differences in the perception of hazard. This is important considering recent dialogue about whether there is a need to train for tasks that will be automated. The idea of training, especially for automated tasks, is important in allowing better recognition of hazard and risk in unusual circumstances. Additional research may help to improve the diagnosis of hazard and risk and may enable generalization of the results to other training scenarios in the manufacturing and services industries.","Hazard perception; Manufacturing safety; Psychophysics; Virtual training","Computer control; Machining; Numerical control systems; Risk assessment; Psychophysics; Ergonomics; adult; article; auditory stimulation; automation; computer; experience; hazard assessment; hearing; human; human experiment; industry; normal human; occupational hazard; perception; prediction; psychophysics; risk assessment; task performance; training; virtual reality; vision; visual stimulation; artificial intelligence; bioengineering; computer interface; equipment; Hong Kong; in service training; occupational accident; occupational health; psychological aspect; questionnaire; risk assessment; student; Accidents, Occupational; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Equipment Safety; Hong Kong; Human Engineering; Humans; Industry; Inservice Training; Occupational Health; Perception; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment; Students; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037440239

The test section was created to measure the velocity and temperature around the engine compartment. Velocity and temperature measurements were collected at several different locations around the engine. To accomplish this, several Pressure transducers along with Pitot tubes and Thermocouples were placed at several predetermined locations based on their assumed experimental importance. Since the experiment was run in a laboratory setting, the Combustion products of the engine were vented to the environment through a venting system via a stainless steel hose. This hose was constructed to attach to both the tractor muffler and the building venting. Then, the instrumentation had to be sized and selected such that the data could be easily acquired and recorded. Next, the necessary data was collected using the selected instrumentation while running the engine in the laboratory space. This data was used to produce an accurate computer model for simulation and to compare several different design adaptations. Based on experimental and computational data, it is noticed that the engine compartment was exhausting hot air that was causing discomfort to the operator and potential harm to the area near their feet. Some modifications were recommended, such as the baffling system, fan system, and grill alterations as an attempt to alter the airflow characteristics of the engine compartment to redirect the hot air away from operator's feet.",,"Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Cooling; Data reduction; Exhaust systems (engine); Fluid dynamics; Heat transfer; Thermal effects; Three dimensional computer graphics; Tractors (agricultural); Velocity measurement; Airflow; Stainless steel hose; Lawn mowers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842713053

Little is known about the comparison of learning time and accuracy between visual and haptic exploration of spatial layouts. In this study, we compared performance on the time to learn and perfectly reproduce four small-scale layouts (floor plans) in four different conditions. These included: visually (computer-based) and haptically (Lego-based) environments presented from a global or reduced view depth. In the global conditions, the complete layout (corridor structure) was available for inspection by vision or touch, whereas in the reduced view conditions, participants had to explore the layouts section by section. Understanding how environmental learning differs as a function of modality and view depth will aid in our development of virtual models for pre-journey navigation through buildings by blind/low-vision people. Methods. Eight normally sighted subjects trained and tested in all four of the complex environments. Their task was to learn the layout (42-60 corridor segments) including the location of five targets and then reproduce it on a Lego grid. Results. This table shows mean learning times and standard errors in minutes. There were significant main effects of modality and viewing condition (p < .001), and a significant interaction. The difference between the view depths in the visual condition was much larger than that for the haptic conditions. Conditions: Visual Haptic Global View 5.56 (1.28) 16.87 (2.90) Reduced View 13.64 (1.85) 21.07 (1.71) Conclusions. The results show that it is faster to learn an environment visually than by touch and that vision benefits most from global viewing. Interestingly, view depth had little effect on learning time in the haptic condition, suggesting that touch is slower and shows a weaker effect of stimulus size than vision because of its smaller effective viewing ""window"". Results will also be discussed in terms of how performance compares to low-vision navigation and to how well these learned environments transfer to real building navigation.",,"analytical error; article; building; computer model; computer simulation; controlled study; depth perception; environmental parameters; human; human experiment; learning; reproducibility; spatial discrimination; standardization; statistical significance; tactile discrimination; tactile stimulation; task performance; virtual reality; visual discrimination; visual information; visual orientation; visual stimulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243121712

This method is highly effective for electrical engineering students who will make use of these techniques throughout their studies. For various reasons, such as non-linearity, Laplace transforms are used less frequently in mechanical engineering. In recognition of this difference, the Dynamic Systems Modeling and Control course (EGR 345) at Grand Valley State University was redesigned. EGR 345 examines systems that contain translational, rotational and electrical components, as well as permanent magnet DC motors. These systems are modeled with differential equations. The students are shown how to solve these systems of equations using explicit integration, numerical integration, and recognition of the canonical forms. Students are then shown how to manipulate equations containing the differential operator, and how to put these into transfer function form. Once in this form it is possible to utilize most of the techniques of classical linear control, such as block diagrams, Bode plots and root-locus diagrams. The course includes a major laboratory component. In the first half of the semester the laboratories focus on modeling physical components. The models can then be used to predict the responses of systems to given inputs. As the semester progresses the labs transition to using industrial motor controllers to reinforce the value of the course material.

The interaction between the large number of variables in these simulations can lead to results that vary widely from between different simulation topologies.

This leads to two distinct response modes: ""tonic"", in which the spike timing is relatively unstructured, and ""burst mode"", involving temporal clustering of the spikes. What are the properties of these distinct modes of firing for the transmission of retinal information to the cortex? We investigated this question by simulating an ""integrate and fire or burst"" model (Smith et al J. Neurophys. 83:588-610) of an LGN cell with synaptic input, and analysing its output using information theoretic procedures. The information in the spike train was broken down into components reflecting the PSTH and autocorrelations using the approach of Panzeri and Schultz (Neural Computation 13(6):1311-1349). This also allowed the redundancy between the information contribution of individual spikes to be examined. We found that bursts lead to a higher information contribution from the PSTH than tonic firing, and this tends to be coupled with a negative contribution due to correlations between spikes. The consequence of this is that burst mode may have a higher instantaneous information rate, but that this is moderated over time by greater redundancy between spikes. The size of this effect depends upon the relative amounts of spontaneous input and retinal drive. We interpret this as consistent with the possibility that bursts may play a role in transient ""updating"" of the cortex, but that tonic firing is required for sustained information transfer in the aroused state.",,"calcium ion; action potential; article; brain cortex; calcium conductance; cell function; interneuron; lateral geniculate nucleus; retina; signal detection; spike; synapse; thalamus; theoretical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243065001

This heuristic, known as optical acceleration cancellation (OAC), produces a near least-energy running solution (provided the optical ball velocity maintained is approximately that initially perceived by the fielder), but it also will guarantee success at other constant optical velocities (provided the fielder can move rapidly enough). In this study, we examined optical behavior of fielders and robotic simulations in the less common case in which a target projectile is dropped, so the initial optical ball velocity is downward. We examined whether fielders attempt to maintain the initial downward optical velocity, or try to run fast enough to reverse the optical direction of the ball (and maintain an arbitrary rising optical speed). Robotic simulations indicated that either strategy can work for slow falling objects like balloons, but for normal balls, realistic lag times do not allow a fielder to move fast enough during the final portion of navigation. Tests with human fielders confirmed that navigating to the interception point of falling objects is quite difficult. Fielders generally selected a running path that did not allow the image of the projectile to descend. For falling balloons this resulted in fielders running rapidly until just a step or two before the point of interception. For falling balls, fielders typically ran as fast as they could. The findings support that fielders try to maintain a rising optical trajectory even in the extreme case of falling balls with initial downward optical trajectories. This further generalizes the range of cases in which OAC is used in interception and confirms that it is not the initial velocity, but the upward direction that appears to be the universal regularity that is maintained while catching.",,"article; concept formation; directional vision; human; human experiment; movement perception; robotics; running; sensorimotor function; simulation; velocity; visual field; visual information",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243167843

Previous evaluations of EID have emphasized representativeness to enhance generalizability of results to operational settings. The research presented here is complementary, emphasizing experimental control to enhance theory building. Two experiments were conducted to test the impact of functional information and emergent feature graphics on adaptation to novelty and change in a thermal-hydraulic process control microworld. Presenting functional information in an interface using emergent features encouraged experienced participants to become perceptually coupled to the interface and thereby to exhibit higher-level control and more successful adaptation to unanticipated events. The absence of functional information or of emergent features generally led to lower-level control and less success at adaptation, the exception being a minority of participants who compensated by relying on analytical reasoning. These findings may have practical implications for shaping coordination in complex systems and fundamental implications for the development of a general unified theory of coordination for the technical, human, and social sciences. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of human-computer interfaces that improve safety in complex sociotechnical systems.",,"Ecology; Human computer interaction; Large scale systems; Social sciences; Ecological interface design (EID); User interfaces; adaptation; article; computer interface; controlled study; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; information; normal human; process control; process design; safety; sociology; technology; theory; thermodynamics; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Attention; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Data Display; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Internal-External Control; Male; Problem Solving; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Software Design; User-Computer Interface; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036962660

However, provided sufficient detailed study and analysis, existing AO systems can be improved beyond their original specified error budgets. Indeed, modeling AO systems has been a major activity in the past decade: sources of noise in the atmosphere and the wavefront sensing (WFS) control loop have received a great deal of attention, and many detailed and sophisticated control-theoretic and numerical models predicting AO performance are already in existence. However, in terms of AO system performance improvements, wavefront reconstruction (WFR) and wavefront calibration techniques have commanded relatively little attention. We elucidate the nature of some of these reconstruction problems, and demonstrate their existence in data from the AEOS AO system. We simulate the AO correction of AEOS in the I-band, and show that the magnitude of the 'waffle mode' error in the AEOS reconstructor is considerably larger than expected. We suggest ways of reducing the magnitude of this error, and, in doing so, open up ways of understanding how wavefront reconstruction might handle bad actuators and partially-illuminated WFS subapertures.","Adaptive optics; Extreme AO (ExAO); Waffle; Wavefront reconstruction","Astronomy; Calibration; Computer simulation; Electrooptical devices; Image reconstruction; Imaging techniques; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; Optical sensors; Optical transfer function; Space telescopes; Wavefronts; Waffle mode error; Wavefront reconstruction; Wavefront sensing control; Adaptive optics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037950185

Generally, for an individual to advance in a business firm, it is required that he/she focus on the central purpose of the firm; this most often is maximizing shareholder equity. As has been widely quoted, the business of business is business. Leaders of technology-based firms should have technical competence and business savvy. There have been notable cases of engineers who have risen to the top of major corporations. In recent history, Jack Welch, Andy Grove and Lou Gerstner are widely known as engineers who have leveraged their technical capabilities while also clearly succeeding in business. There are unfortunately many more counterexamples of engineers who have entered corporations with strong technical capabilities and interest in promotion within the corporation, but who have failed to advance as a result of shortcomings in their business skills and sophistication. This paper describes an ongoing collaborative effort between the Colleges of Engineering and Business at the University of Texas at Austin to create a business short-course for engineering students to familiarize them with business concepts. The objective is not to teach the students all they will ever need to know about business, but instead to teach them the importance of understanding the business implications of technology transfer in commercial ventures. To accomplish these goals in a two week short-course, the faculty members involved are packaging a set of electronic business tutorials of relevance to engineering students. The two week short course culminates in a simulation where the students start a business and run it over several years with the objective of maximizing shareholder equity. The details of implementing this collaborative program are provided in this manuscript.",,"Business skills; Engineering students; School activities; Shareholder equity; Industry; Optimization; Product design; Project management; School buildings; Students; Testing; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744259590

Methods: We administered a six-task laparoscopic skills curriculum to postgraduate year (PGY) 2 and PGY3 surgical housestaff. Six laparoscopic tasks were divided into two groups: generalized skills and task specific skills. All participants were evaluated during a pretest and were placed in the novice group (total score less than 600) or in the intermediate skill (IS) group (total score 600 or more). Each participant had two 1-hour practice/instruction sessions and 2 weeks for independent practice. After these sessions, a posttest was administered. Results: Novices and intermediate skill participants demonstrated significant improvement in general skills and task specific skills. However, comparison of novice and IS group learners revealed that IS group learners were significantly more proficient in the performance of general skills, but the performance of task specific skills failed to demonstrate a difference between the two groups. On posttest, there was no significant difference in overall score between novices and IS participants. Conclusions: Overall ability and performance of generalized skills by all housestaff are improved with a laparoscopic skills curriculum; however, the performance of novices improved the greatest. Task specific skills did not discriminate novices from more advanced learners. Early testing of housestaff may identify those individuals who could benefit from intervention and instruction prior to performing the laparoscopic skills in the operating room. © 2002 Excerpta Medica Inc.

This paper deals with the granularity of implementation of ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL 5) protocol stack. The focus of this study is to propose an AAL 5 implementation that would outperform the existing implementation schemes. This paper also makes an effort to analyze the performance of the proposed implementation and validate the simulation results using analytic modeling. We also experimented with the simulation model to find out the best range of packet size and burst size for the AAL 5 stack. It was found that in order to achieve a good performance, the minimum recommended packet size should be 0.5 KB. This is a reasonable packet size for IP over ATM. We can have higher packet sizes in order to obtain better efficiency, however, this may cause for problems with memory requirements. Therefore, the upper limit to packet size for efficient and practical implementation should be 10 KB. Finally, it is very important on the segmentation side for the memory to be of fixed latency. If the Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) interface to memory is not of fixed latency, further cycle loss could be introduced. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Short pulse probing techniques have distinct advantages over conventional very large pulse width or cw lasers primarily due to the additional information conveyed about the tissue interior by the temporal variation of the observed signal. The distinct feature is the multiple scattering induced temporal signatures that persists for time periods greater than the duration of the source pulse and is a function of the source pulse width, the scattering/absorbing properties and nature of the medium, the location in the medium where the properties undergo changes. A wide range of parameters such as tissue and tumor size, scattering/absorbing properties and phase function of tissues and tumors, tumor location, laser beam diameter will affect the temporal and spatial distribution of the reflected and transmitted optical signals. The goal is to perform a parametric study in order to gain insight about laser-tissue interaction characteristics with the goal to detect tumors. © 2002 SPIE.","Detection; Short pulse laser; Tissues; Transient radiative transfer; Tumor","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Continuous wave lasers; Diagnosis; Laser beams; Light absorption; Light reflection; Light scattering; Light transmission; Tumors; Ultrashort pulses; Transient radiative transfer; Tumor detection; Tumor diagnostics; Laser tissue interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036056507

Each node independently maintains a mobility metric indicating how fast its neighborhood is currently changing, and a route-demand metric indicating which destinations are currently involved in data forwarding. Control functions use these metrics to dynamically adjust the period and the content of routing updates. We apply ARM to the destination sequence distance vector (DSDV) protocol, coming up with ARM-DSDV. Simulations for various mobility and workload scenarios show that ARM-DSDV typically achieves better data delivery, while keeping the routing cost at reasonable levels, when compared to DSDV with update period optimized for the scenario. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The objective was to obtain periodic movement patterns. Spring-like running was monitored by a one-dimensional stride-to-stride mapping of the apex height to identify mechanically stable fixed points.We found that for certain angles of attack, the system becomes self-stabilized if the leg stiffness was properly adjusted and a minimum running speed was exceeded. At a given speed, running techniques fulfilling a stable movement pattern are characterized by an almost constant maximum leg force. With increasing speed, the leg adjustment becomes less critical. The techniques predicted for stable running are in agreement with experimental studies.Mechanically self-stabilized running requires a spring-like leg operation, a minimum running speed and a proper adjustment of leg stiffness and angle of attack. These conditions can be considered as a movement criterion for running.

The next logical step was to transfer the entire game on to the computer, thus increasing accessibility to students and allowing for a richer and more accurate simulation of patient scenarios. Methods: First, a general game model was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic. A breast module was then created using 3-D models, radiographs, and pathology and cytology images. The game was further improved by the addition of an animated facilitator, who directs the players via gestures and speech. Thirty-three students played the breast module in a variety of team configurations. After playing the game, the students completed surveys regarding its value as both an educational tool and as a form of entertainment. 10-question tests were also administered before and after playing the game, as a preliminary investigation into its impact on student learning. Results: After playing the game, mean test scores increased from 6.43 (SEM ± 0.30) to 7.14 (SEM ± 0.30; P = 0.006). The results of the five-question survey were extremely positive. Students generally agreed that the game concept has value in increasing general knowledge regarding the subject matter of breast disease and that the idea of following simultaneously the work-up of numerous patients with similar problems is a helpful way to learn a work-up algorithm. Conclusions: Postgame surveys demonstrate the efficacy of our computer game model as a tool for surgical education.

The thermal interaction between the blood vessel pair and surrounding tissue is investigated for two vascular branching patterns, pure branching and pure perfusion. It is shown that temperature variations along these large vessel pairs strongly depend on the branching pattern and the local blood perfusion rate. The arterial supply temperature in different vessel generations was evaluated to estimate the arterial inlet temperature in the modified perfusion source term for the s vessels in Part 1 of this study.

In this approach, a modified proxy intercepts requests and serves all responses to clients marked uncacheable, effectively disabling browser caches and allowing the proxy to record requests that would otherwise result in silent browser cache hits. WebTV Networks used a 'cache-busting proxy' to collect an unusually large and detailed anonymized Web client trace in September 2000. It contains over 347 million requests for over 36 million documents by over 37,000 clients and spans 16 days. By most measures, it is two orders of magnitude larger than existing Web client traces. We compare cache-busting proxies with conventional client instrumentation and use the WebTV trace to explore browser cache performance, reference locality, and document aliasing. We present the aggregate browser cache success function (hit rate vs. cache size) of the entire client population and discuss design implications for memory- and bandwidth-constrained Web clients. For the workload studied, eliminating redundant data transfers would increase browser cache hit rates by 35-45% over their current levels. A simple and practical technique for eliminating redundant transfers is described. Document sharing across client reference streams is so strong that the hit rate of a shared proxy cache could exceed 57% even if browser caches were infinitely large. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We now report a new phenomenon which demonstrates that frame of reference information may be similarly transferred. We show transfer between proprioceptive/kinesthetic sense of hand orientation and vision for the purposes of reestablishing coordinated visual-manual activity in the presence of exocentricly referenced rotational sensory-motor transformations. Such rotational misalignments are encountered in teleoperation &telerobotics when the remote image sensor, usually a camera, is oriented so that resulting display coordinates are rotated with respect to the coordinates in which a user must operate a remote manipulator (e.g Smith &Smith, 1962). To demonstrate the new phenomenon the hand not used for control is utilized to provide a kinesthetic cue to the camera orientation and thereby greatly reduce the difficulty in compensating for the control-display misalignment. In essence the cueing hand, which is positioned to copy the attitude of the viewing camera, provides a kinesthetic reference for the movement of the controlling hand. Users then make their control movements relative to their kinesthetic sense of the orientation of the cueing hand. Experimental testing shows that this technique works &can reduce control inaccuracy associated with some rotational misalignments by 64% w/o explicit training. We now can show that the phenomenon is generally not demonstrable without explicit attentional effort by the subjects and can use an immersing virtual environment to demonstrate it with three-axis transformations.","Motion &deficits posters","article; attention; camera; controlled study; error; hand movement; human; human experiment; image display; physical activity; proprioception; remote sensing; robotics; rotation; sensorimotor function; spatial orientation; training; virtual reality; vision; visual information; visual orientation; visuomotor coordination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143088255

The model uses an approach similar to Brinson, Liang and Rogers, and Tanaka. It links key thermomechanical variables: stress, strain, temperature, and martensite fraction. A basic differential form for the SMA constitutive behavior, developed by Tanaka, forms the foundation of the model. The model is completed with a definition of the rules governing the behavior of martensite fraction. Like Brinson, the model distinguishes between de-twinned and twinned martensite. The phase transition temperatures are assumed to be a linear function of applied stress. The forward and reverse phase transformations are described by piecewise exponential functions. There are a number of parameters in the model that need to be determined using experimental data. The critical transformation temperatures are determined by resistivity measurements. All other parameters are determined by mechanical tension testing followed by nonlinear least-squares estimations. Mechanical testing consisted of displacement controlled, tension tests on Nitinol wires at several temperatures. The effectiveness of this model is demonstrated by its use in the design of an SMA actuated robotic arm. The constitutive model is used in conjunction with a lumped heat transfer model, a kinematic model, and a dynamic model to predict the behavior of the arm. Comparison between predictions and experimentally observed behavior is very good indicating a sound constitutive model. The model is also built into a finite element code that simulates pseudoelastic SMA behavior. The code considers geometric and material nonlinearities. The behavior of a simple pseudoelastic device is shown to be well predicted by the finite element code.","Constitutive; Design; Finite-Element Analysis; Shape Memory Alloy","Computer simulation; Finite element method; Intelligent materials; Phase transitions; Robotic arms; Strain; Stress analysis; Twinning; Thermomechanical behavior; Shape memory effect",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036031255

Thus, a muscle can redistribute existing segmental energy by accelerating some segments and decelerating others. In the process, a muscle may also produce or absorb energy, in which case its summed energetic effect on the segments is positive or negative, respectively. This Borelli Lecture shows how dynamical simulations derived from musculoskeletal models reveal muscle-induced segmental energy redistribution and muscle co-functions and synergies. Synergy occurs when co-excited muscles distribute segmental energy differently to execute the motor task. In maximum height jumping, high vertical velocity at lift-off occurs desirably at full body extension because biarticular leg muscles redistribute the energy produced by the uniarticular leg muscles. In pedaling, synergistic ankle plantarflexor force generation during leg extension allows the high energy produced by the uniarticular hip and knee extensors to be delivered to the crank. An analogous less-powerful flexor synergy exists during leg flexion. Hamstrings reduce crank deceleration during the leg extension-to-flexion transition by not only producing energy but delivering it to the crank through its contribution to the tangential (accelerating) crank force, though this hamstrings function occurs at the opposite (flexion-extension) transition when pedaling backwards. In walking, the eccentric quadriceps activity in early stance not only decelerates the leg but also accelerates the trunk. In mid-stance, the uni- and biarticular plantarflexors, by having opposite segmental energetic effects, act in synergy to support the whole body, so segmental potential and kinetic energy exchange can occur. To conclude, the extraction of unmeasurable variables from dynamical simulations emulating task kinematics, kinetics, and EMGs shows how the production of force and energy by individual muscles contribute to the energy flow among the individual segments during task execution.","Cycling; Jumping; Motor control; Musculoskeletal models; Walking","Joints (anatomy); Kinematics; Muscle; Flexors; Biomechanics; conference paper; deceleration; dynamics; electromyography; energy absorption; energy transfer; energy yield; hamstring; human; jumping; kinematics; kinetics; leg movement; leg muscle; motor activity; motor coordination; muscle contraction; muscle force; musculoskeletal system; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; simulation; standing; velocity; walking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036064566

Noninvasive transcutaneous delivery of therapeutic focused ultrasound has previously been shown to thermally occlude the vas deferens. However, skin bums and inconsistent vas occlusion have presented complications. This study uses bioheat transfer simulations and thermocouple measurements to determine the optimal ablation dosimetry for vas occlusion without skin burns. A two-radian ultrasound transducer clip delivered 4 MHz ultrasound energy to the canine vas deferens co-located at the focus between the clip jaws. Chilled, degassed water was circulated through an attached balloon, providing efficient ultrasound coupling into the tissue and applied cooling to prevent skin burns. Temperatures were recorded at the vas, intradermal, and skin surface during ablation. Acoustic powers of 3-7 W and sonication times of 60-120 sec were used on both the left and right vas (n=2) in a total of four dogs (Control, 3W/120s, 5W/90s, 7W/60s). Measurements were compared with bio-heat transfer simulations modeling the effects of variations in power and sonication time on tissue temperatures. Simulations and experiments suggest that a therapeutic window exists in which vas occlusion may be achieved without skin burns (P = 5-7 W, SI = 1.4-1.9 W/cm2, t = 20-50 sec).

The temporal response caused by charge trapping and release gives rise to the imaging properties of lag and ghosting. These imaging properties depend on both the design and operational parameters of the detectors as well as the material properties of a-Se. Our approach was to measure the x-ray photocurrent of electroded a-Se detectors as a function of x-ray exposure and correlate these measurements with an experimental investigation of charge trapping by use of the ""time-of-flight"" method. These experimental results are compared with models based on previously published values of material properties such as electron and hole trapping and recombination cross-sections. The resulting model can be used to predict lag and ghosting in radiographic and fluoroscopic flat panel detectors. We also investigated the effect of charge trapping between the pixel electrodes of an a-Se flat-panel detector on lag and ghosting. Our method for quantitative evaluation of lag and ghosting in a-Se will facilitate the optimization of imaging performance. This is achieved by determining the combination of materials properties, system design and operational parameters which minimize artifacts arising from either lag or ghosting in a-Se flat-panel detectors. © 2002 SPIE ·1605-7422/02/$15.00.","Amorphous selenium; Digital radiography; Fluoroscopy; Ghosting; Lag; Memory effects","Amorphous materials; Computer simulation; Electrons; Fluorescence; Hole traps; Optical transfer function; Optimization; Photocurrents; Photodetectors; Selenium; X rays; Flat panel detectors; X-ray imaging detectors; Imaging systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036033452

The study shows there exists a window size that will maximize or minimize certain performance parameters for a given perspective distortion and object planarity variance. The analysis also indicates that for a given perspective distortion where pitch angle is the only parameter, many performance criterion have an optimum window size if the object model is allowed to vary. The performance measures examined are expected peak value, peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR), probability of acquisition (PCA), and image registration error covariance. Window adaptation based on precomputed metrics is applied to extend distortion tolerance. Statistically consistent image sets are geometrically transformed by a general perspective spatial mapping using statistically consistent independent non-planar object models with arbitrary generalized autocorrelation functions. The two images are then registered through an image matching technique, the defining functions analyzed and limitations on the amount of perspective viewpoint change of an imaging system in an aerial tactical arena are given while still allowing proper image correspondence. Monte Carlo simulation verification of theoretical predictions and results are extended to a variety of common area-based image matching techniques.","Adaptive windows; Geometric distortion; Image matching; Perspective projections; Terrain models","Computational geometry; Computer simulation; Error analysis; Imaging systems; Mapping; Mathematical transformations; Monte Carlo methods; Object recognition; Pattern matching; Photogrammetry; Aerial tactical arena; Geometric distortion; Image matching; Non planar object model; Perspective projections; Terrain models; Military operations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036437009

Rather than telling the observers that they were being timed, the observers were given a time limit, as short as 3 seconds. When time limited, the observers found targets quicker. Although false alarms per second increased with the shorter time limits, the ratio of false alarms to detected targets did not increase.

Traditionally, computer science instructors have used the software as a visual aid in lectures, or as the basis for interactive laboratories. An alternative approach, inspired by Social Constructivist learning theory, is to have students construct and present their own visualizations. Notice that, in this alternative approach, rather than acting as a knowledge conveyer that transfers an expert's mental model of an algorithm to students, AV software grants students access to forms of expert course participation typically reserved only for instructors. To explore this alternative approach, I conducted a pair of ethnographic field studies in a junior-level algorithms course that included AV construction and presentation assignments. Through a broad range of field techniques, including participant observation, interviewing, videotaping, and diary collecting, I gained crucial insights into the approach. My most significant finding was that, when used within the context of AV construction and presentation exercises, conventional AV software can actually distract students from concentrating on activities and concepts relevant to an undergraduate algorithms course. When supported by an alternative, ""low tech"" version of AV technology, however, AV construction and presentation appear not only to focus students on relevant activities and concepts, but also to enable them to participate more extensively the course, thus contributing to their learning. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Cooperative/collaborative learning; Evaluation of CAL systems; Pedagogical issues; Simulations; Teaching/learning strategies","Education; Teaching; Video recording; Visualization; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Evaluation of CAL systems; Pedagogical issues; Simulations; Teaching/learning strategy; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31244433184

Our experiments used a transfer-of-adaptation paradigm to test the idea that these two types of reaches are mediated by a common, early perceptual representation. Methods: Subjects reached in virtual reality to positions of visual targets or to match lengths of visible rods. Both tasks used the same set of reach endpoints and similar timing constraints; trajectories were almost indistinguishable. Feedback was given at the end of each reach by a visible marker indicating final hand position or by a second rod whose length indicated distance reached. During some runs, subjects received misleading position- or length-based feedback about the distance component of hand position. We examined the transfer of the resulting visuomotor adaptation between tasks. Results: Subjects showed near-complete adaptation to misleading positional feedback, but a few did not adapt to length-based feedback. Most subjects showed little or no transfer of adaptation between tasks; a small number showed partial or complete transfer. Examination of differences in reach latency between the tasks suggests that subjects who showed transfer of adaptation were using overlapping perceptual strategies in the two tasks; future experiments will examine the possibility that their perceptions of location were less accurate in the virtual reality than those of subjects who did not show transfer of adaptation. We will also attempt to determine what is being adapted in our tasks by examining the limb- and posture-specificity of the adaptation. Conclusions: Positional and length-based reaches are not mediated by a common, early perceptual representation; instead, information about position and length are kept separate until after visuomotor adaptation occurs.",,"accuracy; adaptation; article; body position; body posture; controlled study; feedback system; hand movement; human; human experiment; latent period; movement perception; normal human; position effect; task performance; time; virtual reality; vision; visuomotor coordination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143056110

The traditional classroom will likely be replaced with an intimate virtual environment. The student centered distance learning archetype will include dynamic demonstrations of theoretical engineering models allowing students to manipulate, experiment, and translate theories into real-world applications. These innovative engineering models will be virtual pedagogical adaptations suited to autonomous learners, individualized experience, and active participation.

Some of the major concerns in using networks to perform remote network-based control are QoS issues such as time delay and bandwidth constraints. Disturbances and unanticipated events often happen to network-based applications. When anomalies happen, if the network cannot provide the required QoS, the application may have to lower its performance requirement and use the assigned QoS to do the best as it can to maintain the application availability.

We are developing a methodology that will enable designers to create models with levels of detail and accuracy that correspond to the current state of the design knowledge. The methodology uses Bayesian surrogate models that are updated sequentially in stages. Thus, designers can create a rough surrogate model when only a few data points are available and then refine the model as the design progresses and more information becomes available. These surrogates represent the system response when limited information is available and when few realizations of experiments or numerical simulations are possible. This paper presents a covariance-based approach for building surrogates in the preliminary design stages when bounds are not available a priori. We test the methodology using an analytical one-dimensional function and a heat transfer problem with an analytical solution, in order to obtain error measurements. We then illustrate the use of the methodology in a thermal design problem for wearable computers. In this problem, the underlying heat transfer phenomena make the system response non-intuitive. The surrogate model enables the designer to understand the relationships among the design parameters in order to specify a system with the desired behavior.",,"Computer simulation; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Measurement errors; Numerical methods; Probability; Product development; Wearable computers; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Analytical one-dimensional function; Bayesian surrogates; Covariance-based approach; Thermal design problem; Product design; Heat transfer; Design knowledge; Design parameters; Error measurements; Heat transfer problems; Incomplete knowledge; Limited information; Preliminary design; Transfer phenomenon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035791030

The laboratory course was developed to accommodate distance-learning students who have limited or no access to campus facilities. All students enrolled in the course have completed an associate degree in electronics or electrical engineering technology and, therefore, have completed traditional basic electronic courses taught in a traditional laboratory environment. Moreover, most of the students are working in industry as engineering technicians and have sufficient maturity to understand some of the practical limitations of this approach. The software utilized is Multisim (Electronics Workbench), which has proven to be very userfriendly and easily learned by students working on their own. Email, a toll-free telephone number, and the transfer of circuit schematics and performance curves over the internet enhance the faculty-student interaction. All of the experiments and projects parallel those offered in the more traditional course on the campus and include numerous linear and non-linear operational amplifier circuits, timers and oscillators, and data conversion circuits. The emphasis throughout the course is on circuit design followed by validation of design specifications by computer simulation of the circuits. A comprehensive final examination testing the expected outcomes of the course has been developed and implemented. Performance studies thus far indicate that the effectiveness of the virtual laboratory is comparable to that of the traditional laboratory. Students also indicate that they work harder and require more time than with traditional laboratories, but their overall evaluation is very positive.",,"Circuit designs; Linear electronics; Virtual laboratory; Computer simulation; Computer software; Design for testability; Electrical engineering; Electronic communities; Electronics engineering; Research laboratories; Students; Technology transfer; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744249984

A critical component of the model is the use of course evaluation committees to oversee and manage each of the courses. These committees, composed of 3-4 faculty members, are charged with maintaining and revising the course learning objectives, assessment instruments, and performance targets for each departmental course. The committees are also charged with preparing the course assessment examination in core courses. The current assessment instruments include course exam questions, employer surveys, alumni surveys, student surveys, faculty surveys, advisory board meeting minutes, and advisory board evaluation of limited student portfolios.

In order to solve the problems of real time availability and realistic quality of simulators, source data images and digital terrain models (DTM) should have some generalized structure, which supposes different imagery resolution and different amount of detail on each level of 3-D simulation. One of the central problems is geotruthing of satellite imagery with realistic accuracy requirements with respect to DTM. Traditionally such geotruthing can be achieved by means of geo control points measurements. This process is labor intensive and requires special photogrammetric operator skills. In order to avoid such a process an algorithm of terrain and image models singularity's recognition based on Catastrophe theory is investigated in this paper. This approach does not require training but operates with direct comparison of the analytical manifolds from DTM with those actually extracted from the image. The technology described in this paper, the ""Catastrophe Approach"", and algorithms of satellite imagery treatment may be implemented in a multi-level image pyramid flight simulators. Theoretical approaches and practical realization indicates that the Catastrophe Approach is easy-to-use for a final customer and can be implemented on-line to networked flight simulators.","Catastrophe Theory; Flight Simulators; GIS; Photogrammetry","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Flight simulators; Geographic information systems; Photogrammetry; Satellites; Satellite imagery; Image sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035763314

It is revealed that due to significant uncertainty on time delays in ABR traffic and strong interaction among switches, ABR traffic imposes a great challenge to control strategy development. Focusing on robustness of congestion control and asymptotic fairness, we propose a new control strategy that employs robust control to accommodate delay uncertainty and rate coordination for fairness. Interaction between these two control actions leads to a non-standard multi-objective control problem. Overall stability of the system and convergence to fairness are rigorously analyzed. Conditions are presented under which robust stability and convergence are guaranteed. Simulation tests are then performed to demonstrate that a redesign of feedback controllers may become necessary to satisfy these conditions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Method: Over 2500 candidates who took the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates' (ECFMG) Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) were studied. The CSA consists of 10 or 11 timed clinical encounters. Standardized patients evaluate spoken English proficiency and interpersonal skills in every encounter. Generalizability theory was used to estimate the consistency of spoken English ratings. Validity coefficients were calculated by correlating summary English ratings with CSA scores and other external criterion measures. Mean spoken English ratings were also compared by various candidate background variables. Results: The reliability of the spoken English ratings, based on 10 independent evaluations, was high. The magnitudes of the associated variance components indicated that the evaluation of a candidate's spoken English proficiency is unlikely to be affected by the choice of cases or SPs used in a given assessment. Proficiency in spoken English was related to native language (English versus other) and scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Discussion: The pattern of the relationships, both within assessment components and with external criterion measures, suggests that valid measures of spoken English proficiency are obtained. This result, combined with the high reproducibility of the ratings over encounters and SPs, supports the use of trained SPs to measure spoken English skills in a simulated medical environment.","Clinical competence; Education, medical; Foreign medical graduates, standards; Language tests; Physician-patient relations; Reproducibility of results; Speech","article; competence; controlled study; doctor patient relation; examination; human; interpersonal communication; medical education; scoring system; skill; speech; Adult; Educational Measurement; Foreign Medical Graduates; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Language; Language Tests; Physician-Patient Relations; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034913188

Existing web caching systems1 typically cache entire web documents and attempt to keep them consistent with the origin server. This approach works well for text and images; for bandwidth intensive multimedia data such as audio and video, caching entire documents is not cost effective and does not scale. An alternative approach is to cache parts of the multimedia stream on different caches in the network and coordinate stream playback from these caches. In such a case, the collection of cooperating distributed caches act as a single cache that is both scalable and fault-tolerant. This paper focuses on the design and the evaluation of novel data placement and replacement techniques for such distributed caches. Specifically, we propose schemes that work together: (1) RCache, a family of easy-to-implement, fault-tolerant multimedia data layout schemes that incorporate novel intra-and inter-clip replication controls, (2) TwoD, a two-dimensional local data replacement scheme based on the concept of segment popularity used for data replacement ordering at each cache. Our schemes optimize storage space, start-up latency, server load, network bandwidth usage, and overhead from playback switch-overs. Our simulation results show that the RCache schemes provide 4 - 9 times higher cache hit ratio than a comparable traditional web caching system with the same amount of storage space. © 2001 SPIE.","Distributed caching; Streaming media; Web caching","Bandwidth; Cache memory; Computer aided design; Computer aided network analysis; Computer simulation; Data transfer; Fault tolerant computer systems; Multimedia systems; Servers; Web caching; Internet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035169055

Our analysis framework is based on the estimation of the energy that is artificially introduced at the fluid/structure interface by the staggering process that is inherent to most partitioned solution methods. This framework also suggests alternative approaches for time-discretizing the transfer of aerodynamic data from the fluid subsystem to the structure subsystem that improves the accuracy and the stability properties of the underlying partitioned method. We apply this framework to the analysis of several partitioned procedures that have been previously proposed for the solution of nonlinear transient aeroelastic problems.

In the current study, we sought to explore the existence of deficits in procedural motor learning, which is a form of implicit motor learning where skill improves over repetitive blocks of trials. We sought to determine, in particular, whether any such deficit is accentuated during specific types or phases of learning. We would expect that those specific learning tasks would require the greatest participation of the basal ganglia. Numerous studies have found that Parkin-son's disease (PD) patients may show deficits in learning. Combined with information about basal ganglia neuronal connections and activity, this led some investigators to suggest that one of the key functions of the basal ganglia is to facilitate learning. To investigate these learning deficits, we used a robotic device to generate conservative force fields that disturbed the subjects' arm movements, thereby generating a ""virtual mechanical environment"" that subjects learned to manipulate. Movements were successively grouped into blocks comprising five different conditions: motor performance, early learning, late learning, negative transfer, and aftereffect motor performance. Our results with eight right-handed PD subjects and nine age-matched controls showed a relative decrease in the rate of learning for the PD patients in all blocks, but greater differences emerged between groups during novelty phases of learning. In particular, the difference in performance during the negative transfer condition reached statistical significance, suggesting that the basal ganglia might be a key center for ""switching"" motor patterns. Our results support the hypothesis that deficiencies in procedural motor learning are characteristic of PD. They add to existing evidence which has suggested a key role for the basal ganglia when new sen-sorimotor mappings are required by novel task environments. Better understanding of these deficits should facilitate the rehabilitation of PD patients.","Human; Motor learning; Parkinson disease; Robot-generated force field; Virtual environment","adult; aged; arm movement; article; basal ganglion; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease association; human; learning disorder; motor dysfunction; motor performance; nerve cell; Parkinson disease; priority journal; right handedness; robotics; sensorimotor function; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Female; Humans; Learning Disorders; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Skills Disorders; Neural Pathways; Parkinson Disease; Psychomotor Performance; Robotics; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035207142

This is needed because the shortest path to the goal is not always the most efficient when you consider the rate of travel over the terrain. To address this issue, we have developed an approach called ERA which uses regression tree induction to learn action models that predict the effect terrain conditions will have on a UGV's navigation actions. The action models support a high level mission planner that finds efficient navigation plans consisting of way-points through which the UGV should travel. We will present results from our experiments in a simulated environment and on an RWI ATRV-Jr robot. The studies evaluate the performance of ERA in different mission scenarios with different amounts of sensor and actuator noise. Advantages of our approach include the ability to automatically learn action models, generate efficient high level navigation plans taking into account terrain conditions and transfer learned knowledge to other missions.","Path planning and navigation","Computer simulation; Ground vehicles; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Navigation systems; Regression analysis; Trees (mathematics); Navigation planning; Unmanned vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035759136

Switching elements in both the copying and routing networks have O(1) bit complexity, making the overall bit level hardware complexity of the network O(N log N). The latency of the switch is proportional to the number of stages O(log N). Unlike other existing copy networks, our copy network drops packets in a fair manner and hence can provide quality of service (QoS) support. The switch is output queued and allows the delivery of multiple packets to the same destination during a time slot.","ATM switch; Deflection routing; Multicasting; Output queueing","Asynchronous transfer mode; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Data communication systems; Multicasting; Packet networks; Quality of service; Queueing networks; Requirements engineering; Address translation tables; Deflection routing; Memory requirements; Multicast packet switch; Output queueing; Routing networks; Unicast packets; Switching networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035675234

To analyze atmospheric effects, a set of radiosoundings was used to cover the variability of surface temperature and water vapor concentration on a world-wide scale. These simulated data were split into two sets which, have very similar distributions in space and time. The first one was used to fit the coefficients of the algorithms for retrieving both SST and LST, while the second one was used to test the fitted coefficients.

A proportional increase in the receiver's field of view, required to collect all of the signal, also causes a corresponding increase in the amount of interfering background radiation, resulting in degraded communications performance. These problems may be mitigated through the use of an optical detector array assembly in the focal plane that can adaptively select areas of higher signal density while ignoring areas predominated by background noise. This concept is investigated for both Poisson photon counting detector arrays and avalanche photodiode arrays. Kolmogorov phase screen simulations are used to model the sample functions of the focal-plane signal distribution due to turbulence and to generate realistic spatial distributions of the received optical field. The optimum photon counting array detector is derived and approximated by a simpler suboptimum structure that replaces the continuous weighting function of the optimal receiver by a hard decision on the selection of the signal detector elements. It is shown that for photon counting receivers observing Poisson distributed signals, performance improvements of up to 5 dB can be obtained over conventional single detector photon counting receivers, when observing turbulent optical fields in high background environments. For the avalanche photodiode detector case, it is shown that gains of up to 4 dB may be achieved by using the array receiver rather than a single APD, but that a photon-counting array still performs about 5.5 dB better than an APD array.",,"Approximation theory; Atmospheric turbulence; Computer simulation; Light modulation; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Optical transfer function; Photodetectors; Photons; Poisson distribution; Signal receivers; Avalanche photodiode array; Focal-plane signal distribution; Poisson photon counting detector array; Optical communication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034875468

Traditional approaches to modeling have relied on rule-based and analytical decision-making models in an attempt to optimize the decision making of an intelligent computer-generated adversary. In order to promote realistic transfer of training in the realm of command and control, the trainee must experience realistic decision-making behavior in the enemy. This means that the enemy must make realistic decisions based on environmental constraints, goals, and intent. The enemy's decisions must then be reflected by the simulated agents.

We have several related projects where the goal is to translate the conceptual RPD Model into a computer model that can simulate realistic expert decision making.

The resulting eye movements reflect the transfer function of the saccadic circuit. Below input modulations of 5 cycles/s, the saccadic circuit increasingly oscillates with multiple high-frequency, low-amplitude movements reminiscent of the ""staircase saccades"" evoked during the sustained step response. Between 5 and 20 cycles/s, the circuit entrains well to the input, exhibiting one saccadic response to each sinusoidal input. Within this range there are systematic frequency-dependent changes in movement amplitudes, including super-normal saccades at some input frequencies. Above 20 cycles/s, the saccadic circuit increasingly exhibits periodic failures at rates of 1:2 or higher. In addition, the circuit exhibits predictable amplitude-modulated interference patterns in response to a combined step and frequency-modulated input. These experimental results provide insight into several biological mechanisms and serve as benchmark tests of viable models of the saccadic system. The data are consistent with negative feedback models of the saccadic system that operate as a displacement controller and inconsistent with theories that put the superior colliculus within the lowest-order, local feedback loop. The data support theories that the circuit feedback operates with dynamics that simulate a ""leaky integrator.""

This paper resolves fan system interactions with a simple closed form general model, the application of which reveals the relative merits of various redundant fan layouts. A simple two part fan model is developed, consisting of an ideal pressure source term and an internal resistance in the form of an orifice loss term. The model is shown to scale with speed by the fan laws when applied to fan curve data. The concept of a hydraulic impedance matching for fan system sizing is then examined. The problem is generalized by rationing the system load to the internal fan impedance, and appropriate scaling of pressures and volumetric flow rates. The relation between system impedance, failed fan impedance, and surviving fan capacity is explored for fans in series and in parallel arrangements. The benefit of adding anti-recirculation flappers to a paired parallel fan arrangement is shown to reduce the fan speed requirement compared to a no-flap design. The necessity of minimizing flapper drag is quantified by a break even analysis. Application of the approach should provide guidance to system designers seeking more effective application of fans in redundant systems.","Acoustic; Airflow; Cooling redundancy; Electronics cooling; Fan; Fault tolerant; Flow network modelling; FNM; Hot swap; Mission critical; N + 1; Network analysis; Packaging; Thermal; Thermal management","Computer simulation; Cooling systems; Fans; Fault tolerant computer systems; Impedance matching (electric); Orifices; Redundancy; Cooling redundancy; Electronics cooling; Flow network modelling; Thermal management; Electronics packaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034829574

In this paper, we propose subband arrays with partial feedback scheme, which generalize the above two feedback schemes. The main contribution of this paper is to derive the steady-state mean square error (MSE) performance of subband arrays implementing these three different feedback schemes. Unlike the centralized feedback scheme which can be designed to provide the optimum equalization performance, the subband arrays with localized and partial feedback schemes are in general suboptimal. The performance of these two suboptimal feedback schemes depends on the channel characteristics, the filter banks employed, and the number of subbands.","Adaptive array; Mobile communications; Multirate signal processing; Space-time adaptive processing; Subband array","Cellular radio systems; Cochannel interference; Computer simulation; Decision feedback equalizers; Digital communication systems; Discrete Fourier transforms; Intersymbol interference; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Signal filtering and prediction; Space time adaptive processing; Vectors; Adaptive arrays; Centralized feedback scheme; Frequency reuse; Localized feedback scheme; Mean square error; Multirate signal processing; Subband arrays; Antenna arrays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035445038

More specifically, we propose to extend the network with an optical ring that not only transfers swapped-out pages between the local memories and the disks of the multiprocessor but also acts as a systemwide write cache for these pages. This extended optical network confers several performance benefits: It provides a staging area where swapped-out pages can reside until the disk is free, it increases the possibility of combining several writes to disk, and it acts as a victim cache for pages that are swapped out and subsequently accessed by the same or a different processor. To evaluate the extent to which these benefits affect performance, we use detailed execution-driven simulations of several out-of-core parallel applications that run on an eight-node scalable multiprocessor. Our results demonstrate that our optical ring provides consistent performance improvements that derive mostly from faster page swap outs and victim caching. To show that our optical ring can also be applied successfully to traditional multiprocessors in which processors are interconnected with electronic networks, we evaluate its benefits for a mesh-connected multiprocessor. This latter evaluation shows that our optical ring improves performance for a traditional multiprocessor by roughly the same amount as it does for an optically interconnected multiprocessor. On the basis of these results and our parameter-space study our main conclusion is that our optical ring is highly efficient under several architectural assumptions and for most out-of-core parallel applications.

We investigated whether this separation of extent and direction planning for well practiced movements could be explained by differences in the adaptation to extent and directional errors during motor learning. We compared the time course and generalization of adaptation with two types of screen cursor transformation that altered the relationship between hand space and screen space. The first was a gain change that induced extent errors and required subjects to learn a new scaling factor. The second was a screen cursor rotation that induced directional errors and required subjects to learn new reference axes. Subjects learned a new scaling factor at the same rate when training with one or multiple target distances, whereas learning new reference axes took longer and was less complete when training with multiple compared with one target direction. After training to a single target, subjects were able to transfer learning of a new scaling factor to previously unvisited distances and directions. In contrast, generalization of rotation adaptation was incomplete; there was transfer across distances and arm configurations but not across directions. Learning a rotated reference frame only occurred after multiple target directions were sampled during training. These results suggest the separate processing of extent and directional errors by the brain and support the idea that reaching movements are planned as a hand-centered vector whose extent and direction are established via learning a scaling factor and reference axes.","Generalization; Motor learning; Psychophysics; Reaching movements; Vectorial planning; Visuomotor transformations","adult; article; brain function; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; normal human; priority journal; psychophysics; task performance; visuomotor coordination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034551777

Our hypothesis is that the fluid space in an osteocytic lacuna facilitates a nearly instantaneous mixing process of bone fluid that creates a difference in tracer concentration between the inward and outward canalicular flow and thus ensures net tracer transport to the osteocytes during cyclic loading, as has been shown experimentally. The sequential spread of the tracer from the osteonal canal to the lacunae is investigated for an osteon experiencing sinusoidal loading. The fluid pressure in the canaliculi is calculated using poroelasticity theory and the mixing process in the lacunae is then simulated computationally. The tracer concentration in lacunae extending radially from the osteonal canal to the cement line is calculated as a function of the loading frequency, loading magnitude, and number of loading cycles as well as the permeability of the lacunar-canalicular porosity. Our results show that net tracer transport to the lacunae does occur for cyclic loading. Tracer transport is found to increase with higher loading magnitude and higher permeability and to decrease with increasing loading frequency. This work will be helpful in designing experimental studies of tracer movement and bone fluid flow, which will enhance our understanding of bone metabolism as well as bone adaptation.",,"Body fluids; Bone; Elasticity; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Metabolism; Physiological models; Porosity; Bone fluid; Poroelasticity; Tracer concentration; Biomechanics; active transport; animal; article; biological model; biomedical engineering; body fluid; bone; histology; mechanical stress; metabolism; Non-programmatic; permeability; physiology; Non-programmatic; Animals; Biological Transport, Active; Biomedical Engineering; Body Fluids; Bone and Bones; Models, Biological; Permeability; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034351089

It relies on an optimization-based differential inverse kinematics to estimate a set of four weighting parameters that quantify a timeconstant, inter-segment motion apportionment strategy. In the development 100 seated reaching movements performed by 10 subjects towards five in-vehicle targets were modelled, resulting in 100 sets of weighting Statistical analysis was then conducted to relate these parameters to and individual attributes. In the validation phase, the generalized model, parameter values statistically synthesized, was applied to novel data sets 700 different reaching movements (towards different targets and/or by subjects). The results demonstrated the model's ability to generate close in prediction: the overall mean time-averaged error in joint angle 5.2°, and the median was 4.7°, excluding reaches towards two extreme targets which modelling errors were excessive).

The number of processes and synapses, and direction and timing of synapse activation, were varied. Simultaneous synapse activation resulted in shortest latency, while directional activation (proximal to distal and distal to proximal) yielded most regular discharges. Color-coded visualizations showed that the simulator discretized events and demonstrated that discharge produced a distal spread of voltage from the spike initiator into the ending. The simulations indicate that directional input, morphology, and timing of synapse activation can affect discharge properties, as must also distal spread of voltage from the spike initiator.

In autapses (self-synapses) formed by cultured hippocampal neurons, short-term synaptic depression (STD) had several unusual features. (1) Reduction of neurotransmitter release probability with Cd2+, a blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels, did not change depression. (2) Lowering [Ca2+](o) and/or raising [Mg2+](o) had little effect on STD in cells with strong baseline depression, but in cells with more modest baseline depression, it reduced the depression. (3) Random variations in the size of initial EPSCs did not influence successive EPSC sizes. These findings were inconsistent with release-dependent mechanisms, such as vesicle depletion, post-synaptic receptor desensitization, and autoreceptor inhibition. Instead, other results suggested that changes in action potentials (APs) contributed to depression. The somatic APs declined in amplitude with repetitive stimulation, and modest reduction of AP amplitudes with tetrodotoxin inhibited EPSCs. Notably, tetrodotoxin also increased depression. Similar changes in axonal APs could produce STD in at least two ways. First, decreasing presynaptic spike amplitudes could reduce calcium entry and release probability. Alternatively, APs could fail to propagate through some axonal branches, reducing the number of active synapses. To explore these possibilities, we derived the expected variance of EPSCs for the two scenarios. Experimentally, the variance increased and then decreased on average with successive responses during trains of APs, confirming a unique prediction from the conduction failure scenario. Thus, STD had surprising properties, incompatible with commonly postulated mechanisms but consistent with AP conduction failure at axonal branches.","Action potential; Autapse; Branch-point failure; Cadmium; Calcium; Cell culture; Conduction failure; Correlation analysis; Hippocampus; Magnesium; Microisland; Miniature EPSC; Propagation failure; Short-term synaptic depression; Short-term synaptic plasticity; Simulation; Tetrodotoxin; Variance analysis","6 nitro 7 sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline 2,3 dione; cadmium; calcium; calcium channel; magnesium; tetrodotoxin; action potential; animal cell; article; controlled study; excitatory postsynaptic potential; hippocampus; nerve cell culture; nerve cell plasticity; neurotransmitter release; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; synaptic transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034175527

We have developed a multifaceted training program for incoming surgical interns in which learning in a simulated environment plays a key role. The purpose of this study was to evaluate resident perceptions of simulated clinical calls as an educational modality and to measure the effect on self-ratings of confidence. Methods: A multidisciplinary team compiled 15 clinical scenarios. Simulated nurse-to-resident clinical call sessions were held on 3 separate days. Daily course evaluation surveys and identical precourse and postcourse confidence surveys were completed. Results: The resident confidence measure increased significantly postcourse (6.73 versus 8.35, P <0.03). The evaluation survey score averaged 4.35 out of 5. Conclusions: Simulated clinical call sessions were well received and resulted in a significant increase in resident confidence levels. Based on this modality's apparent efficacy and ease of implementation, we offer it as a useful educational tool for incoming postgraduate year-1 surgical residents.

The functions can be organized into three antagonistic pairs: an Ext/Flex pair that accelerates the foot into extension or flexion with respect to the pelvis, an Ant/Post pair that accelerates the foot anteriorly or posteriorly with respect to the pelvis, and a Plant/Dorsi pair that accelerates the foot into plantarflexion or dorsiflexion. Previous analyses of experimental data have inferred that muscles perform the same function during different pedaling tasks (e.g. forward versus backward pedaling) because the EMG timing was similar, but they did not present rigorous biomechanical analyses to assess whether a muscle performed the same biomechanical function, and if so, to what degree. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine how individual muscles contribute to these biomechanical functions during two different motor tasks, forward and backward pedaling, through a theoretical analysis of experimental data. To achieve this objective, forward and backward pedaling simulations were generated and a mechanical energy analysis was used to examine how muscles generate, absorb or transfer energy to perform the pedaling tasks. The results showed that the muscles contributed to the same primary biomechanical functions in both pedaling directions and that synergistic performance of certain functions effectively accelerated the crank. The gluteus maximus worked synergistically with the soleus, the hip flexors worked synergistically with the tibialis anterior, and the vasti and hamstrings functioned independently to accelerate the crank. The rectus femoris used complex biomechanical mechanisms including negative muscle work to accelerate the crank. The negative muscle work was used to transfer energy generated elsewhere (primarily from other muscles) to the pedal reaction force in order to accelerate the crank. Consistent with experimental data, a phase shift was required from those muscles contributing to the Ant/Post functions as a result of the different limb kinematics between forward and backward pedaling, although they performed the same biomechanical function. The pedaling simulations proved necessary to interpret the experimental data and identify motor control mechanisms used to accomplish specific motor tasks, as the mechanisms were often complex and not always intuitively obvious.The contributions of individual muscles to the biomechanical functions during two different motor tasks, namely, forward and backward pedaling, were determined using a theoretical analysis of experimental data.

Matching rules for these tilings were enforced by coating tiles with patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches or wetting codes.

The specific aims of such efforts are to assure machining quality right up to boundaries or pre-machined sections, which are inherent in intricate part geometry. Such boundaries frustrate heat-transfer and result in bulk heating of the workpiece. This in turn leads to a degradation of the machining quality. In order to achieve such optimization, transient heat-transfer is modeled. Close inspection of the laser-workpiece interaction zone reveals that the machining front exhibits dynamic behaviour, and such mobility plays a significant role in temperature determination. Non-linear parameter adaption profiles are generated via the optimization strategy in order to stabilize the machining front temperatures. Currently, trial-and-error based experimentation is needed in order to improve machining quality in such regions. Thus model-based optimization has the added benefit of reducing this step whilst leading to an optimal solution.

The Banyans are composed of 2 × 4 switching elements (SEs). The SE implemented by 0.35 μ CMOS logic gates. Circuit simulations of the SE show satisfactory performance at 1 Gbps. The non-blocking behavior of the SB fabric is verified by VHDL. The proposed fabric uses output queuing to resolve contention. In general, the output buffer handles K QoS levels by K virtual queues. Focusing on the case K = 2, we propose a buffer management and channel allocation strategy that can be adjusted to meet the delay and loss requirements of the two types of traffic. The output buffer is managed as two virtual queues, each handling a different traffic type. To meet the delay QoS of one traffic type, the channel is allocated to the respective queue with a probability that depends on the congestion level in that queue. We present a model and analysis of the output queues and calculate the waiting time and loss performance under two specific allocation strategies. The results indicate that the proposed channel allocation strategy is quite effective in maintaining a balance between the QoS objectives of the two traffic types.",,"Asynchronous transfer mode; Broadband networks; Buffer storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer simulation; Logic design; Logic gates; Queueing theory; Switching systems; Telecommunication traffic; Asynchronous transfer mode switch; Banyan fabric; Channel allocation; Output queuing; Wide area networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033691232

To restore the initial posture, the neuromuscular system must provide damping, which is the dissipation of the mechanical energy imparted by such a perturbation. Despite their importance, damping properties of the neuromuscular system have been poorly characterized. Accordingly, this paper describes the damping characteristics of the neuromuscular system interacting with inertial loads. To quantitatively examine damping, we coupled simulated inertial loads to surgically isolated, reflexively active soleus muscles in decerebrate cats. A simulated force impulse was applied to the load, causing a muscle stretch, which elicited a reflex response. The resulting deviation from the initial position gave rise to oscillations, which decayed progressively. Damping provided by the neuromuscular system was then calculated from the load kinetics. To help interpret our experimental results, we compared our kinetic measurements with those of an analogous linear viscoelastic system and found that the experimental damping properties differed in two respects. First, the amount of damping was greater for large oscillation amplitudes than for small (damping is independent of amplitude in a linear system). Second, plots of force against length during the induced movements showed that damping was greater for shortening than lengthening movements, reflecting greater effective viscosity during shortening. This again is different from the behavior of a linear system, in which damping effects would be symmetrical. This asymmetric and nonlinear damping behavior appears to be related to both the intrinsic nonlinear mechanical properties of the soleus muscle and to stretch reflex properties. The muscle nonlinearities include a change in muscle force-generating capacity induced by forced lengthening, akin to muscle yield, and the nonlinear force-velocity property of muscle, which is different for lengthening versus shortening. Stretch reflex responses are also known to be asymmetric and amplitude dependent. The finding that damping is greater for larger amplitude motion represents a form of automatic gain adjustment to a larger perturbation. In contrast, because of reduced damping at small amplitudes, smaller oscillations would tend to persist, perhaps contributing to normal or 'physiological' tremor. This lack of damping for small amplitudes may represent an acceptable compromise for postural regulation in that there is substantial damping for larger movements, where energy dissipation is more critical. Finally, the directional asymmetry in energy dissipation provided by muscle and reflex properties must be reflected in the neural mechanisms for a stable posture.",,"animal experiment; article; body posture; cat; decerebration; energy transfer; muscle force; muscle length; muscle stretching; neuromuscular system; nonhuman; oscillation; priority journal; reflex; soleus muscle; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033951121

The resulting image degradation can seriously undermine the effectiveness of the sensor. In many astronomical systems, which typically have a very narrow field of view, the entire image can be modeled by the convolution of the object with a single point spread function (PSF), and as a result of the narrow field of view, adaptive optical systems can be highly effective in correcting astronomical images. In the case of tactical infrared sensors the field of view is generally much larger than the isoplanatic angle, and the image cannot be modeled by a single point spread function convolved with the scene. Hence, adaptive optical solutions to wide angle infrared imaging over horizonatal paths would be difficult, if not impossible, and post-detection processing of the images is required to mitigate turbulence effects. The overall effect of turbulence within a given isoplanatic patch is not as strong as in the astronomical imaging case due to shorter paths and longer wavelengths. Tilt and low order turbulence modes dominate the aberration experienced within individual isoplanatic patches, greatly simplifying image reconstruction problems. In this paper we describe an algorithm for processing video sequences capable of partially correcting these turbulence effects. The algorithm is based on block matching algorithms used in video compression. Simulation results show that this algorithm reduces the squared error of the imagery, and subjectively better images are obtained.",,"Adaptive optics; Algorithms; Atmospheric turbulence; Computer simulation; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image sensors; Infrared imaging; Light propagation; Optical transfer function; Refractive index; Anisoplanatism; Block matching algorithms; Atmospheric optics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034498006

The maximum likelihood (ML) single-symbol multiuser DPSK/CDMA detector is derived with direct generalization to multiple-symbol (block) multiuser DPSK/CDMA detection. Exponential complexity requirements limit the use of the ML rule to theoretical lower-bound bit-error-rate benchmarking. Linear filter DPSK demodulators are viewed as a practical alternative. Phase-ambiguous RAKE filtering followed by RAKE-output differential detection is considered. The familiar minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) PSK/CDMA filter (designed for minimum filter output energy under the constraint of distortionless response in a given RAKE vector direction) adds the valuable feature of active interference suppression; however, minimum disturbance variance at the differential logic output can be claimed formally only in the absence of multipath (no inter-symbol-interference). Short-data-record adaptive alternatives to costly and slow adaptive MVDR implementations are sought in the context of auxiliary-vector (AV) filtering. Numerical and simulation studies illustrate the developments.",,"Adaptive filtering; Bit error rate; Code division multiple access; Communication channels (information theory); Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Demodulators; Interference suppression; Intersymbol interference; Maximum likelihood estimation; Phase shift keying; Radio receivers; Linear filter; Minimum variance distortionless response; Multipath channel; Time varying channels; Direct sequence systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033697149

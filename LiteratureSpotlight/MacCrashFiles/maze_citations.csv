In the first phase of the experiment, two groups of healthy middle-aged participants had to learn and remember five out of 20 target locations either in a ""real"" locomotor maze or an equivalent VR-version of this maze. The group with the VR-training was also confronted with the task in the real maze after achieving a learning criterion. Though acquisition rates were widely equivalent in the VR- and locomotor groups, VR participants had more problems learning the maze in the very first learning trials. Good transfer was achieved from the virtual to the real version of the maze by this group and they were significantly better in the acquisition phase of the locomotor task than the group that had not received VR-training. In the second phase of the experiment -the probe trials- when the cue configuration was changed the group with the VR-training seemed to have specific problems. A considerable number of participants of this group were not able to transfer information.",Memory; Orientation; Spatial cognition; Spatial memory; Spatial orientation; VR-environment,Data acquisition; Ecology; Learning systems; Personnel training; Problem solving; Virtual reality; Memory orientation; Spatial cognition; Spatial memory; Spatial orientation; Cognitive systems,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-8344234240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvements in motor tasks through the use of smartphone technology for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"Background: In individuals severely affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), virtual reality has recently been used as a tool to enhance community interaction. Smartphones offer the exciting potential to improve communication, access, and participation, and present the unique opportunity to directly deliver functionality to people with disabilities. Objective: To verify whether individuals with DMD improve their motor performance when undertaking a visual motor task using a smartphone game. Patients and methods: Fifty individuals with DMD and 50 healthy, typically developing (TD) controls, aged 10–34 years participated in the study. The functional characterization of the sample was determined through Vignos, Egen Klassifikation, and the Motor Function Measure scales. To complete the task, individuals moved a virtual ball around a virtual maze and the time in seconds was measured after every attempt in order to analyze improvement of performance after the practice trials. Motor performance (time to finish each maze) was measured in phases of acquisition, short-term retention, and transfer. Results: Use of the smartphone maze game promoted improvement in performance during acquisition in both groups, which remained in the retention phase. At the transfer phases, with alternative maze tasks, the performance in DMD group was similar to the performance of TD group, with the exception of the transfer to the contralateral hand (nondominant). However, the group with DMD demonstrated longer movement time at all stages of learning, compared with the TD group. Conclusion: The practice of a visual motor task delivered via smartphone game promoted an improvement in performance with similar patterns of learning in both groups. Performance can be influenced by task difficulty, and for people with DMD, motor deficits are responsible for the lower speed of execution. This study indicates that individuals with DMD showed improved performance in a short-term motor learning protocol using a smartphone. We advocate that this technology could be used to promote function in this population.",2231011506,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Capelini, Camila Miliani;Talita Dias da Silva;Tonks, James;Watson, Suzanna;Mayra Priscila Boscolo Alvarez;Lilian Del Ciello de Menezes;Francis Meire Favero;Fátima Aparecida Caromano;Massetti, Thais;Carlos Bandeira de Mello Monteiro",,," © 2017.

To go from one place to another, we routinely generate internal representations of surrounding spaces, which can include egocentric (body-centred) and allocentric (world-centred) coordinates, combined into route and survey representations. Recent studies have shown how both egocentric and allocentric representations exist in parallel and are joined to support behaviour according to the task. Our study investigated the transfer from survey (map-like) to route representations in healthy and brain-damaged subjects. The aim was two-fold: first, to understand how this ability could change with age in a sample of healthy participants, aged from 40 to 71 years old; second, to investigate how it is affected after a brain lesion in a 8 patients' sample, with reference to specific neuropsychological frames. Methods. Participants were first required to perform the paper and pencil version of eight mazes, then to translate the map-like paths into egocentric routes, in order to find the right way into equivalent Virtual Reality (VR) mazes. Patients also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, including a specific investigation of some topographical orientation components. Results. As regards the healthy sample, we found age-related deterioration in VR task performance. While education level and gender were not found to be related to performance, global cognitive level (Mini Mental State Examination), previous experience with computer and fluidity of navigation into the VR appeared to influence VR task results. Considering the clinical sample, there was a difficulty in performing the VR Maze task; executive functions and visuo-spatial abilities deficits appeared to be more relevant for predicting patients' results. Conclusions. Our study suggests the importance of developing tools aimed at investigating the survey to route transfer ability in both healthy elderly and clinical samples, since this skill seems high cognitive demanding and sensitive to cognitive decline. Human-computer interaction issues should be considered in employing new technologies, such as VR environments, with elderly subjects and neurological patients. © 2011 Carelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,adult; aged; aging; article; brain injury; computer graphics; computer interface; education; female; human; male; maze test; middle aged; neuropsychological test; orientation; physiology; psychological aspect; psychomotor performance; sexual development; stroke; Adult; Aged; Aging; Brain Injuries; Computer Graphics; Education; Female; Humans; Male; Maze Learning; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Orientation; Psychomotor Performance; Sex Characteristics; Stroke; User-Computer Interface,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251585565,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

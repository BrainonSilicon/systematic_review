Conventional methods tackle tracking and camera control tasks separately, and the resulting system is difficult to tune jointly. These methods also require significant human efforts for image labeling and expensive trial-and-error system tuning in the real world. To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an end-to-end solution via deep reinforcement learning. A ConvNet-LSTM function approximator is adopted for the direct frame-to-action prediction. We further propose an environment augmentation technique and a customized reward function, which are crucial for successful training. The tracker trained in simulators (ViZDoom and Unreal Engine) demonstrates good generalization behaviors in the case of unseen object moving paths, unseen object appearances, unseen backgrounds, and distracting objects. The system is robust and can restore tracking after occasional lost of the target being tracked. We also find that the tracking ability, obtained solely from simulators, can potentially transfer to real-world scenarios. We demonstrate successful examples of such transfer, via experiments over the VOT dataset and the deployment of a real-world robot using the proposed active tracker trained in simulation.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2899570","Tencent AI Lab Rhino-Bird Focused Research Program; Qualcomm University Collaborative Research Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642452","Active object tracking;reinforcement learning;environment augmentation","Object tracking;Cameras;Target tracking;Reinforcement learning;Robot vision systems","convolutional neural nets;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object tracking;recurrent neural nets","end-to-end active object tracking;real-world deployment;visual observations;frame sequences;camera control signals;camera control tasks;deep reinforcement learning;ConvNet-LSTM function approximator;frame-to-action prediction;customized reward function;unseen object moving paths;unseen object appearances;distracting objects;tracking ability;real-world robot;active tracker","","11","","71","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this system, the wireless-powered node, e.g., a user equipment (UE), receives data at the same time when powered from the other node, e.g., an access point (AP), and uses the harvested wireless energy to send data to the other node. The investigation focuses on the delay performance of sending data in the downlink (DL) from the AP node to the UE node and that in the uplink (UL) from the UE node to the AP node, based on which the throughput performance on both directions when delay constraints are enforced is also studied. To this aim, the cumulative service capacity of the service process is first analyzed for both DL and UL, taking into consideration the delay caused by the nontransmission phase for the AP or UE in each charging cycle. Thereafter, a general upper bound on the delay distribution for stochastic traffic arrivals is obtained for both DL and UL, based on which the delay-constrained throughput performance is further studied. In addition, to ensure the delay performance, the required energy storage capacity and wireless charging rate are investigated. The obtained results are exemplified with two specific traffic types, and the accuracy of the analysis is validated by comparison with extensive simulation results.

In a constructed prototype, high-power SiC modules with dedicated drivers are utilized to achieve high-efficiency and compact size. Each module has two interconnected switches with anti-parallel diodes resembling a converter leg. It is observed that the driver halts the module operation as a result of protective actions such as overcurrent, gate undervoltage, or gate overvoltage. In this frozen leg mode, the module operates as a leg with two diodes until an external hardware signal resets the driver. The converter continues operation but with a reduced performance. Analysis, simulation, and verification of a three-phase DAB converter under a frozen leg operation are considered in this paper. The converter with a frozen leg has two different behaviors at light loads and heavy loads. Consequently, two different analysis methods are developed to solve converter operation in different load conditions.

Self-organization problems, intrinsic behaviors as well as effective learning and skill transfer processes in the context of robotic systems have been significantly investigated by researchers. Our work presents a new framework of developmental skill learning process by introducing a hierarchical nested multi-agent architecture. A neuro-dynamic learning mechanism employing function approximators in a fuzzified state-space is utilized, leading to a collaborative control scheme among the distributed agents engaged in a continuous space, which enables the multi-agent system to learn, over a period of time, how to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner without any prior task model. The agents comprising the system manage to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform by continuously exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space. For the specific problem setting, the proposed theoretical framework is employed in the case of two simulated e-Puck robots performing a collaborative box-pushing task. This task involves active cooperation between the robots in order to jointly push an object on a plane to a specified goal location. We should note that 1) there are no contact points specified for the two e-Pucks and 2) the shape of the object is indifferent. The actuated wheels of the mobile robots are considered as the independent agents that have to build up cooperative skills over time, in order for the robot to demonstrate intelligent behavior. Our goal in this experimental study is to evaluate both the proposed hierarchical multi-agent architecture, as well as the methodological control framework. Such a hierarchical multi-agent approach is envisioned to be highly scalable for the control of complex biologically inspired robot locomotion systems.","","978-1-4244-9318-0","10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5723346","Developmental Robotics;Multi-Agent Architectures;Neuro-Dynamic Learning","Mobile robots;Computer architecture;Joints;Robot kinematics;Function approximation;Collaboration","dynamic programming;fuzzy set theory;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems","fuzzy rule based neuro-dynamic programming;mobile robot skill acquisition;nested multiagent architecture;biologically inspired architectures;intelligent robots;self-organization problems;effective learning;skill transfer processes;developmental skill learning process;neuro-dynamic learning mechanism;function approximators;collaborative control scheme;distributed agents;multiagent system;e-Puck robots;collaborative box-pushing task;complex biologically inspired robot locomotion systems","","2","","31","","3 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adults also exhibit this behaviour when entering new spaces such as kitchens. We develop a method, Contextual Prior Prediction, which provides a means of transferring knowledge between interactions in similar domains through vision. We develop agents that exhibit exploratory behavior with increasing efficiency, by learning visual features that are shared across environments, and how they correlate to actions. Our problem is formulated as a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit where the contexts are images, and the robot has access to a parameterized action space. Given a novel object, the objective is to maximize reward with few interactions.

We tested the present strategy on several simulation scenarios; involving two virtual robots that each must cooperate with other and estimating collision-free actions.

The complication increases due to large computation burden and time for wide-area network where thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC) is used as controller for transient stability enhancement. The trade-off in accuracy and speed in generating control law using linearized models becomes ineffective for changed operating scenarios. In addition, forming multi-machine linearized model becomes challenging when TCSC appears as non-separable element of a dense admittance matrix, which can be separated as a control variable in single-machine infinite-bus system. Overcoming the limitations of linearized controllers, the present paper verifies the Kuramoto mean-field condition using Kron reduction with non-trivial transfer conductances for unstable post-fault scenario.

During the training stage the robot first learns to perform a set of basic action primitives through the mechanism of direct grounding. Subsequently, the grounding of action primitives, acquired via direct sensorimotor experience, is transferred to higher-order words via linguistic descriptions. The idea is that by combining words grounded in sensorimotor experience the simulated robot can acquire more abstract concepts.

These switches, when elaborated by the operator of the CEMIG operations centre, increase the collective continuity indicators, DEC and FEC, and the individual continuity indicators DIC, FIC and DMIC of the utility grid. The modelling and simulation of the feeders will be done through the drawing environment of the software ATP Draw (Alternative Transient Program). The software allows the operator to perform tests and simulations to analyse possible current and voltage transients in the feeders before sending the switch item to the field team to begin maintenance. Thus, it is intended to analyse the influence of switches on the current profile in the feeders and voltage at the high priority loads, that such feeders supply in different demand scenarios. In addition, considerable transients may arise due to the switches, which makes this analysis indispensable for real maintenance actions.","","978-1-5386-3363-2","10.1109/SBSE.2018.8395641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8395641","maintenance in electrical feeders;electromagnetic transient analysis;load transfer","Noise measurement;Software;Integrated circuit modeling;Education;Transient analysis;Maintenance engineering;Load modeling","EMTP;maintenance engineering;power distribution faults;power engineering computing;power supply quality","CEMIG operations centre;collective continuity indicators;utility grid;analyse possible current voltage transients;switches;current profile;Itajuba electric power distribution system;IJAU11 feeders;voltage profiles;DEC;FEC;DIC;FIC;DMIC;alternative transient program software;voltage transients;current transients;high priority loads;Itajuba Electrical Energy Company;ATPDraw;IJAU10 feeders","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under high field conditions (>10/sup 8/ Vm/sup -1/), space charge and the concomitant electric field dynamics are involved in the initiation of dielectric breakdown. Space charge is established either by charge transferred across electrode-insulator interfaces, or by field assisted ionisation of centres within the bulk of the dielectric. The action of high fields upon charge provides mechanisms by which electrical energy is transformed into potentially destructive mechanical energy. Measurements of the dynamic space charge distribution within plane parallel samples of insulators contained between aluminium electrodes under high voltage DC stress have been previously obtained using a pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) apparatus. The pulsed electro-acoustic technique has been developed to provide a high resolution and reliable method of measuring the space charge density dynamics within insulators. It is a flexible alternative to the pressure wave propagation method. In this paper, experimental data for space charge dynamics within degassed cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is compared to a simple numerical simulation, which has been derived from concepts first utilised in semiconductor physics.","","0-7803-2040-9","10.1109/ICSD.1995.523001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=523001","","Space charge;Pulse measurements;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Current measurement;Charge measurement;Pulsed electroacoustic methods;Cable insulation;Power generation;Electricity supply industry;Virtual manufacturing","space charge;XLPE insulation;hole traps;electron traps;acoustoelectric effects","model;bipolar charge transport;insulators;electrical cable insulation failure;high field conditions;space charge;electric field dynamics;dielectric breakdown;electrode-insulator interfaces;field assisted ionisation;mechanical energy;pulsed electro-acoustic technique;degassed cross-linked polyethylene;XLPE;numerical simulation;trapping model;80 kV","","3","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It consists of four operations with different actions on the Stokes profiles alternately carried out downwards from the surface. The main assumption made is that the height gradients of all parameters influencing the Stokes profiles are not so large that they cause rapid shifts with depth of the positions of peaks or valleys in the profiles.By the inversion of synthetically simulated profiles of Mg I b 5172.7 Å, the feasibility of the method is shown in that the present method can recover the quasistatic structure of the vector magnetic fields, especially of the field strengths, from the surface to the lower layers in the chromosphere, if the spectral resolution and purity are good enough.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/288.1.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8133954","polarization;radiative transfer;Sun: magnetic fields","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Dynamic instability evaluation is based on the on-line estimation and prediction of the Lateral Load Transfer (LLT) from a vehicle model based on two 2D representations. As off-road vehicles are considered, grip conditions have a large influence. They are here estimated relying on observation theory. Nevertheless, two main behaviours (over/under-steering) may be encountered pending on grip and vehicle configuration. Since only a low cost perception system can be considered in ATV applications, these two opposite dynamics cannot be explicitly discriminated. As a result, two observers are designed, according to the vehicle behaviour, to estimate on-line the terrain properties (grip conditions, global sideslip angle and bank angle) and a “supervisor” selects on-line the right observer. Next, a predictive control algorithm, based on the extrapolation of rider's action and the selected estimated dynamical state, allows the rollover risk to be anticipated, enabling to warn the pilot and to consider the implementation of active actions. Simulations and full-scale experimentations are presented to discuss the efficiency of the proposed solution.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-1736-8","10.1109/IROS.2012.6385652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385652","","Acceleration;Adaptation models;Force;Estimation;Vehicles;Switches;Wheels","control system synthesis;extrapolation;observers;off-road vehicles;predictive control;risk analysis;stability;steering systems","backstepping observer design;rollover risk;under steering situation;ATV;all-terrain vehicle;rollover prevention system;dynamic instability evaluation;lateral load transfer;LLT;vehicle model;2D vehicle representation;off-road vehicle;grip condition;predictive control algorithm;extrapolation;dynamical state estimation;oversteering situation","","2","","13","","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pattern recognition is used to sense changes in the control system requiring a change in the model operating mode. The form of the model is derived from consideration of the physiological processes evident in a human controller. It contains separate sections dealing with perception of the control system variables, action taken by the central nervous system (CNS) as a result of the sensory inputs, and the conversion of CNS commands into motions of the controller. The model reflects the influence of the dominant type 2 control strategy on the type 1 strategy when tracking is performed with heterogeneous plant axis dynamics.

However, the main challenges of this control scheme are poor dynamic behaviour and low quality of PV power. This paper presents a decentralized coordinated PV droop control method, which applies dP/dI for accurate energy distribution and faster response speed. Moreover, the inner control parameter d2P/dI2 is used to further minimize the PV power fluctuation in a steady state which allows to track the error with a corrective action.

When the subjects try to control the external devices purely using brain signals without actual movements (brain control), they adjust the neural firing patterns to adapt to device control, which expands the state-action space for the RL decoder to explore. The challenge is to quickly explore the new knowledge in the sizeable state-action space and maintain good performance. Recently quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning (QAGKRL) was proposed to quickly explore the global optimum in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). However, its network size will grow large when the new input comes, which makes it computationally inefficient. In addition, the output is generated using the whole input structure without being sensitive to the new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new kernel based reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes the clustering technique in the input domain. The similar neural inputs are grouped, and a new input only activates its nearest cluster, which either utilizes an existing sub-network or forms a new one. In this way, we can build the sub-feature space instead of the global mapping to calculate the output, which transfers the old knowledge effectively and also consequently reduces the computational complexity. To evaluate our algorithm, we test on the synthetic spike data, where the subject's task mode switches between manual control and brain control. Compared with QAGKRL, the simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve a faster learning curve, less computational time, and more accuracy. This indicates our algorithm to be a promising method for the online implementation of BMIs.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513597","","Kernel;Firing;Decoding;Neurons;Task analysis;Human factors","brain;brain-computer interfaces;computational complexity;Hilbert spaces;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;pattern clustering","BMIs;neural adaptation;limb movements;brain signals;brain control;neural firing patterns;device control;RL decoder;sizeable state-action space;QAGKRL;kernel based reinforcement learning algorithm;clustering technique;nearest cluster;computational time;synthetic spike data;computational complexity;reproducing kernel hilbert space;quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning;neural inputs;brain machine interfaces;learning curve","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cluster Analysis;Movement;Reinforcement, Psychology","3","","12","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, C. elegans neurons communicate with each other through graded potentials instead of action potentials, requiring redesign of the BioRC neuromorphic circuits to mimic a non-spiking neural network representing motion in C. elegans. Each neuron designed uses basic circuits like spike-responsive or graded-potential excitatory or inhibitory synapses, a voltage adder (dendritic computations) and an axon hillock (for spiking motor neurons). A neuromorphic neural network was constructed in CMOS using our neural circuits to implement touch-induced locomotion.

Wise",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2016","462","1","81","91","Magnetic fields permeate the Universe on all scales and play a key role during star formation. We study the evolution of magnetic fields around a massive metal-free (Population III) star at z ∼ 15 during the growth of its H ii region and subsequent supernova explosion by conducting three cosmological magnetohydrodynamics simulations with radiation transport. Given the theoretical uncertainty and weak observational constraints of magnetic fields in the early universe, we initialize the simulations with identical initial conditions only varying the seed field strength. We find that magnetic fields grow as ρ2/3 during the gravitational collapse preceding star formation, as expected from ideal spherical collapse models. Massive Population III stars can expel a majority of the gas from the host halo through radiative feedback, and we find that the magnetic fields are not amplified above the spherical collapse scaling relation during this phase. However, afterwards when its supernova remnant can radiatively cool and fragment, the turbulent velocity field in and around the shell causes the magnetic field to be significantly amplified on average by ∼100 in the shell and up to 6 orders of magnitude behind the reverse shock. Within the shell, field strengths are on the order of a few nG at a number density of 1 cm−3. We show that this growth is primarily caused by small-scale dynamo action in the remnant. These strengthened fields will propagate into the first generations of galaxies, possibly affecting the nature of their star formation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stw1673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8180685","MHD;radiative transfer;stars: Population III;supernovae: general;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The consequence is that evaluations are performed in a simulated environment, and the optimal robot trajectory computed is then transferred to the actual robot. This paper focuses on reducing the number of evaluations required for computing an optimal robot joint trajectory. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods have been adapted to the CGDA framework to be studied and compared: naíve PSO, Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation PSO (AFFG-PSO), and Fitness Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO). Experiments have been performed for two representative use cases within CGDA: the “wax” and the “painting” action. The experimental results of PSO methods are compared with those obtained with the Steady State Tournament used in the original proposal of CGDA.

We focus on a kind of mobile robot system - the robot soccer “small-size” domain, in which tactical and high-level team strategies build upon individual robot ball-based skills. In this paper, we present our work using a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn three real robot primitive skills in continuous action space: go-to-ball, turn-and-shoot and shoot-goalie, for which there is a clear success metric to reach a destination or score a goal. We introduce the state and action representation, as well as the reward and network architecture. We describe our training and testing using a simulator of high physical and hardware fidelity. Then we test the policies trained from simulation on real robots. Our results show that the learned skills achieve an overall better success rate at the expense of taking 0.29 seconds slower on average for all three skills.

In the ER approach, the object surface is divided into tiles, and the DS field amplitude associated with each tile is given. Assuming that the transmit antenna (or emitted field) is fixed and the phases associated with different tiles are independent, this paper proposes a phase evolution model based on the relative spatial locations of the receive antenna (Rx) to each tile. The proposed model contains two parts: the deterministic part that depends on the variation of the distance from Rx to tile center, and the correlated random part that depends on the variation of the angle between the Rx and the normal vector of tile. The correlation of the tile field phases resulting from the angular variation is modeled by the exponentially damped cosine correlation function. The proposed phase evolution model is evaluated by being applied to the ER approach to predict the DS component of radio channel transfer function (CTF).

In machine learning adaptive control the control scheme is independent of the mathematical modelling of the object dynamics and the precise estimation of its physical parameters. The article presents the authors own work, and that of others, on rules for controlling dynamic systems, and for designing robust rule-based controllers, efficient and adaptable, that has been applied in numerous simulations and to physical process control. The work reported catalogues experiments into intelligent control by human-supervised learning, passive learning, and machine learning. The work started with observing human-supervised learning, these observations led to the development of generalised rules for an automatic controller. Later, when this controller was applied to the physical system, the sensed outputs were post-processed by the c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm to demonstrate passive learning.

It is frequently used in automotive, off-road, and industrial environments with several IoT nodes connected to it. Control messages with commands can cause an actuator to perform some action. An adversary might observe the control message and subsequent action. Injecting the control message at a later time (replay attack) should not replay the same action. Unfortunately current CAN protocol provides no protection against such attacks. Third party components may reverse engineer messaging protocols to gain control over critical systems resulting in dangerous system malfunctions. In a connected vehicle ecosystem, these attacks can also originate at peer vehicles with transactions coming in through one of the IoT nodes on the CAN bus. The proposed solution is to verify the integrity and authenticity of messages. Verifying the integrity of a freshness value appended to messages prevents replay attacks. Authenticity guarantees messages do not come from a malicious party. A keyed hash function using a shared secret key enables authenticated messages. The challenges are: (1) establishing a shared secret and (2) synchronizing a freshness value. Past standards limit CAN message sizes to 8 bytes. New standards (CAN-FD) allow for longer messages. We propose appending 8 bytes to messages to provide integrity and authenticity. Nodes require a shared key and freshness value for creating these bytes. Many scenarios require shared key renegotiation. The shared key is negotiated using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) infrastructure. Protocols are developed for establishing a shared key and synchronizing a freshness value. Protocol correctness is verified through simulations.","","978-1-7281-5503-6","10.1109/WF-IoT48130.2020.9221400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9221400","","","controller area networks;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","IoT nodes connected;control message;subsequent action;replay attack;connected vehicle ecosystem;freshness value;authenticity guarantees messages;shared secret key;longer messages;shared key;controller area network bus facilitates;memory size 8.0 Byte","","","","20","","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These objects operate as autonomous agents to request and provide information and services to users. Establishing trustworthy relationships among the objects greatly improves the effectiveness of node interaction in the social IoT and helps nodes overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk. However, there are limitations in the existing trust models. In this paper, a comprehensive model of trust is proposed that is tailored to the social IoT. The model includes ingredients such as trustor, trustee, goal, trustworthiness evaluation, decision, action, result, and context. Building on this trust model, we clarify the concepts of trust in the social IoT in five aspects such as: 1) mutuality of trustor and trustee; 2) inferential transfer of trust; 3) transitivity of trust; 4) trustworthiness update; and 5) trustworthiness affected by dynamic environment. With network connectivities that are from real-world social networks, a series of simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the social IoT operated with the proposed trust model.

The controller consists of a nonlinear excitation controller and a fast valving controller for each generator. By employing the direct feedback linearization (DFL) technique, a decentralized nonlinear controller is found for multimachine power system excitation control. The excitation controller design problem for an n-machine system is converted to designing n controllers for n linearized and decoupled plants. Then, an optimal fast valving controller is designed to reduce the mechanical power input when a severe fault occurs. In order to reduce the control cost, the fast valving loop is switched on for only a certain period after a fault occurs. By the coordinated action of the two control inputs, transient stability of the system can be greatly enhanced. The proposed scheme is applied to a three-machine system. Simulation results show that power angle oscillations after large disturbance can be damped out rapidly. Simulation results also indicate that the performance of the proposed controller is robust against fault location, network variation and power transfer conditions.","","0-7803-2981-3","10.1109/EMPD.1995.500708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=500708","","Control systems;Power system control;Power system transients;Power system stability;Linear feedback control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Power system faults;Power systems;Optimal control;Costs","power system stability;power system transients;power system control;nonlinear control systems;decentralised control;controllers;control system synthesis;feedback;linearisation techniques;optimal control","nonlinear decentralized coordinated control;multimachine power systems;transient stability enhancement;fast valving controller;nonlinear excitation controller;direct feedback linearization;decoupled plants;linearized plants;optimal fast valving controller;controller design;control cost reduction;power angle oscillations;fault location;network variation;power transfer conditions","","2","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The severe limitations on system performance and energy efficiency imposed by this data movement are further exacerbated with any increase in the distance the data must travel. This data transfer and its associated obstacles could be eliminated by the use of emerging non-volatile resistive memory technologies (memristors) that make it possible to both store and process data within the same memory cells. In this paper, we propose four in-memory algorithms for efficient execution of fixed point multiplication using MAGIC gates. These algorithms achieve much better latency and throughput than a previous work and significantly reduce the area cost. They can thus be feasibly implemented inside the size-limited memory arrays. We use these fixed point multiplication algorithms to efficiently perform more complex in-memory operations such as image convolution and further show how to partition large images to multiple memory arrays so as to maximize the parallelism. All the proposed algorithms are evaluated and verified using a cycle-accurate and functional simulator.

The student must then be free to try to solve the proposed problem using a strategy he thinks is the best one. The traditional way is using an expert system that solves the same problem and then compares both approaches. This behaviour is good enough to transfer the specialist knowledge for a beginner student, but it brings a restriction when learning a new subject. In medicine the diagnosis process is a graph search-like problem, where the physician determines a feasible way through all possible actions he can take at each moment (symptoms, historical data, etc.). He creates a path that he believes is the best way to achieve the desired goal, i.e., being able to explicit the cause of the troubles the patient presents. When a student is to learn how to work with the same situation, the system must give the student the knowledge used to find such a path. But the result of this process is better when instead of only saying to him what is to be done at each moment, the student is allowed to try his own ideas and giving him advice about each step through the path.

The paper proposes the first effort in merging the RF energy transfer functions within a standards compliant 802.11 protocol to realize practical and WiFi-friendly Energy Delivery (WiFED). The WiFED architecture is composed of a centralized controller that coordinates the actions of multiple distributed energy transmitters (ETs), and a number of deployed sensors that periodically request energy from the ETs. The paper first describes the specific 802.11 supported protocol features that can be exploited by sensors to request energy and for the ETs to participate in the energy delivery process. Second, it devises a controller-driven bipartite matching-based algorithmic solution that assigns the appropriate number of ETs to energy requesting sensors for an efficient energy transfer process. The proposed in-band and protocol supported coexistence in WiFED is validated via simulations and partly in a software defined radio testbed, showing 15% improvement in network lifetime and 31% reduction in the charging delay compared to the classical nearest distance-based charging schemes that do not anticipate future energy needs of the sensors and are not designed to co-exist with WiFi systems.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486207","","Sensors;Energy exchange;Wireless fidelity;Array signal processing;Receivers;Protocols;Radio frequency","array signal processing;computer network reliability;protocols;radio transmitters;software radio;telecommunication power management;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","WiFi systems;distributed beamforming;indoor sensors;WiFED architecture;multiple distributed energy transmitters;ET;wireless RF energy transfer function process;WiFi-friendly energy delivery architecture;ISM band;packet reception;standards compliant 802.11 protocol;software defined radio testbed;nearest distance-based charging scheme;energy requesting sensors;controller-driven bipartite matching-based algorithmic solution","","1","","19","","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we propose and optimize the application of decentralized power transfer and radio access in WPNs, which is implemented by using multiple remote radio heads (RRHs) with the capability to both transfer energy and receive information. More specifically, the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) is investigated, while two novel schemes are proposed, hereinafter termed as partially and fully asynchronous transmission TDMA (AT-TDMA). According to the proposed schemes, the users harvest energy and transmit information to the RRHs in different portions of time. Furthermore, the sum and minimum throughput among users are jointly maximized by obtaining the Pareto optimal solutions for the scheduling of power transfer and information transmission. To evaluate the performance of the decentralized architecture compared to the centralized one, we solve the aforementioned optimization problem for both architectures, taking also into account the circuit power consumption. Simulations show that the use of multiple RRHs improves spectral efficiency compared to the centralized implementation, since it can tackle more efficiently the doubly near-far problem.

Using these forecasts, control policies can be determined that specify the unit's discharge rates over a planning horizon in a manner that prevents peaks in the combined flow at the transfer point from exceeding belt capacity limits while simultaneously insuring adequate unit through-flow to prevent it from becoming a production bottleneck. This paper first extends this control approach to the case where the differences in transit times between surge units are small. It is shown that multiple units should be considered simultaneously when determining control actions, and a dynamic programming approach is given for determining the optimal control policy in such a situation. Subsequently the application of this approach is considered for longwall mines where flow from the longwall is not controlled but the discharge rates of continuous miner section feeders are adjusted in real time to prevent belt overloading while minimizing any production constraint from the continuous miner units. This application requires special treatment for the highly variable material flow pattern produced by longwalls.

Our method addresses two key challenges in reinforcement learning: the difficulty of transferring continuous state domain into the discrete state space, and the need for a good compromise between exploration and exploitation. To tackle the former challenge, the adaptive state aggregation algorithm with a decision tree helps the agent to learn the optimal policy in continuous state space. For the latter challenge, this paper proposes an adaptive state aggregation algorithm, which uses information entropy to evaluate the probability of state-action-dependent exploration and the value for ε is determined using the information entropy instead of manual tuning. Meanwhile, a Tabu search is used to lift the efficiency of exploration. For the planning algorithm, the time required for global exploration depends only on the metric resolution, and not on the size of the state space. The simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which adaptively partitions the state space into exclusive subspaces and, meanwhile, obtains a good compromise between exploration and exploitation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8781772","Reinforcement learning;ε-greedy;exploration-exploitation;Q-learning;state aggregation","Estimation error;Reinforcement learning;Decision trees;Information entropy;Training;Tuning;Adaptation models","data aggregation;decision trees;entropy;learning (artificial intelligence);planning (artificial intelligence);search problems","data aggregation;planning algorithm;Tabu search;decision tree;learning agents;experiences collection;state-action-dependent exploration;information entropy;continuous state space;adaptive state aggregation algorithm;discrete state space;domain knowledge;reinforcement learning systems","","","","28","CCBY","30 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The potential for subsynchronous torsional interaction (SSTI) with static VAr compensators (SVCs) and other FACTS devices has been considered in simulation studies as well as in real applications. System studies suggest that large SVCs could have a noticeable impact on torsional vibration modes of nearby generators especially under high-stress conditions. The SSTI sensitivity to SVCs appears from these investigations, mainly related to the dimension and location of SVCs as well as the effect of the voltage control loop and supplemental modulation controls at subsynchronous frequencies. Analysis of SSTI requires complete characterisation of both, the electromechanical dynamics and the electromagnetic dynamics of the network including representation of power system controls in the subsynchronous frequency range. As pointed out by several researchers, SSTI involving FACTS devices is a rather complicated phenomenon, which depends on several factors such as power flow and the interaction with other control devices and control actions. This paper presents some recent advances on the development of analytical techniques for the analysis of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) with AC transmission lines and SSTI with power system controls, namely SVCs and thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs). Emphasis is being placed on the analysis of the combined effect of series capacitor-compensated transmission lines and SVCs on torsional vibrations. An advanced linear state model of the power system that includes the representation of several FACTS devices is presented.","","0-7803-5836-8","10.1109/PTC.1999.826707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826707","","Voltage control;Frequency;Power system dynamics;Power system control;Power transmission lines;Power system modeling;Static VAr compensators;Electromagnetic analysis;Load flow;Resonance","flexible AC transmission systems;torsion;subsynchronous resonance;power transmission lines;static VAr compensators;power capacitors;thyristor applications","subsynchronous torsional interaction;FACTS devices;flexible AC transmission system;power transfer enhancement;voltage stabilisation;subsynchronous oscillations excitation;turbine-generators;static VAr compensators;high-stress conditions;torsional vibrations;series compensated AC lines;HVDC converters;phase-locking methods;valve firing;electromechanical dynamics;electromagnetic dynamics;power system controls;subsynchronous resonance analysis;AC transmission lines;thyristor-controlled series capacitors;series capacitor-compensated transmission lines;linear state model;adverse interaction effects;54 bus 12 machine test system","","3","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the proportion of dispatchable generation decreases through increased renewable duplicating conventional stations, the use of flexible demand in this will increasingly grow. This paper presents an assessment of the ability of a demand response approach on a large scale to mitigate the vulnerability of transmission line outages. It is demonstrated by means of integrating the power flow analysis tool, MATPOWER with demand side management simulator based on PowerMatcher Technology. Two terms, line outage distribution factor (LODF) and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF), are used to determine the most effective localized demand side action.

However, the advances in computing power and wireless network bring new opportunities to the usability research. This paper discusses the challenges and presents a new method for testing the usability of mobile phones. This method utilizes the computing power of the so-called “Smart Phone” to record the user's activities, such as actions, sound and screen. The recorded data are then transferred via the Wi-Fi network to the observer's side in a silent manner without disturbing the user. Experiments were conducted to see whether this method meets the requirement of remote usability testing. The results showed that the data recording could work efficiently without disturbing the user, and the data transfer could be timeliness in an environment with good signal.

Usually, the evaluation of a BCI system is approached through the quantification of the classifier performance, which is often measured by means of the information transfer rate (ITR). A shortcoming of this approach is that the control interface design is neglected, and hence a poor description of the overall performance is obtained for real systems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel metric based on the computation of BCI Utility. The new metric can accurately predict the overall performance of a BCI system, as it takes into account both the classifier and the control interface characteristics.

The proposal is based on a control law that feed backs internal rotor angle deviation to the governor of every generator. As a result, the governor acts as a distributed controller for frequency and transferred power, which uses local measurements. Although information exchange between governors is not performed, they describe a synchronized behaviour because of the natural coupling between the generators' speed. Control response times are lower than centralized schemes such as the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) due to the fact that control actions can be carried out locally near the disturbance. Simulation in the IEEE 39-Bus System on PowerFactory Digsilent permit us to compare the performance of D_LFC with respect to AGC.","","978-1-7281-9365-6","10.1109/ANDESCON50619.2020.9272070","Escuela Politécnica Nacional; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272070","load frequency control;automatic generation control;distributed control;power systems;consensus","Generators;Frequency control;Rotors;Power systems;Turbines;Automatic generation control;Couplings","control system synthesis;distributed control;distributed power generation;frequency control;load regulation;power generation control;power system interconnection;power system transient stability;rotors","power systems;control law;distributed controller;automatic generation control;control actions;IEEE 39-bus system;distributed load-frequency control;internal rotor angle deviation;control response times","","","","17","","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of FOPID controllers requires the setting of four parameters, i.e. the gains of the three different actions and the non-integer order of differentiation, because the non-integer order of integration is fixed to an optimal value. An efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO) sets the parameters in two steps: firstly for an inner loop, secondly for an outer loop. The DOPID controller is characterized by seven different orders of integration or differentiation. In this second case, the tuning is also performed by PSO in two steps. In both cases, the feedback transfer function of the inner loop is a non-integer order plant for the outer loop, then the outer controller should be of fractional order to obtain the best performance/robustness indexes, as shown by simulation.","","978-3-907144-00-8","10.23919/ECC.2019.8796163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796163","","","control system synthesis;machine control;particle swarm optimisation;permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors;three-term control;transfer functions","inner loop;noninteger order plant;outer loop;outer controller;PMSM drives;permanent magnet synchronous motors;FOPID controllers;PSO;DOPID controller;particle swarm optimization;distributed-order proportional-integral-derivative controller","","","","23","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to its speed and flexibility, the HVDC technology is able to provide transmission system advantages as transfer capacity enhancement and power flow control. In addition, studies have shown that the way of controlling the HVDC converters impacts the stability of the AC system. This can be particularly exploited to enhance the dynamic power system performances during transients. In this paper a robust multivariable control design for HVDC link converters is proposed. It is based on the coordination of the control actions of the HVDC converters and the use of a control model which takes into account the dynamics that mostly impact stability of the neighbor zone of the HVDC link. This new methodology was used to synthesize the controller for an actual grid 1000 MW HVDC link reinforcement project called ""Midi-Provence"" in the southern part of the French grid. The synthesis, implementation and validation processes are presented in detail. The new controller is tested in comparison with the standard vector control. A large-scale dynamic model of the whole European power system, currently used and updated by the European TSO's for the interconnection studies has been used with Eurostag simulation software.","","978-83-935801-3-2","10.1109/PSCC.2014.7038407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038407","","HVDC transmission;Power system stability;Mathematical model;Stability analysis;Europe;Power system dynamics;Sensitivity","control system synthesis;HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;load flow control;multivariable control systems;power grids;power system interconnection;power transmission control;robust control","asynchronous AC systems;meshed AC power system;transmission system;transfer capacity enhancement;power flow control;dynamic power system performances;robust multivariable control design;HVDC link converters;neighbor zone;grid link reinforcement project;Midi-Provence;French grid;validation processes;standard vector control;large-scale dynamic model;European power system;European TSO;interconnection studies;Eurostag simulation software;power 1000 MW","","4","","22","","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a design for autonomous multi-lane cruising by combining a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with a novel state-action space abstraction. While the proposed solution follows the classical hierarchy of behavior decision, motion planning and control, it introduces a key intermediate abstraction within the motion planner to discretize the state-action space according to high level behavioral decisions. We argue that this design allows principled modular extension of motion planning, in contrast to using either monolithic behavior cloning or a large set of handwritten rules. Moreover, we demonstrate that our state-action space abstraction allows transferring of the trained models without retraining from a simulated environment with virtually no dynamics to one with significantly more realistic dynamics. Together, these results suggest that our proposed hierarchical architecture is a promising way to allow reinforcement learning to be applied to complex multi-lane cruising in the real world.","","978-1-5386-7024-8","10.1109/ITSC.2019.8916928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8916928","","Planning;Trajectory;Switches;Roads;Learning (artificial intelligence);Task analysis;Safety","learning (artificial intelligence);motion control;path planning;road vehicles;vehicle dynamics","autonomous multilane cruising;hierarchical reinforcement learning framework;classical hierarchy;behavior decision;motion planning;motion planner;high level behavioral decisions;monolithic behavior cloning;hierarchical architecture;complex multilane cruising;hierarchical planning;competent multilane cruising;lane changes;within-lane maneuvers;good speed;intermediate abstraction;state-action space abstraction","","","","15","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this purpose, muscle-actuated walking simulation which can offer insights into the actions of muscles during walking is performed in the open-source software OpenSim. The contributions of major muscles of the lower limb to body propulsion and support during walking are analyzed. The analysis indicates that for normal walking, hip flexor, hip extensor, knee extensor, and ankle plantar flexor are the most important contributors in providing propulsion and support, whereas knee flexor and ankle dorsiflexor play a very small role. On this basis, a new twodimensional musculoskeletal model of the lower limb is proposed by replacing the muscles that contribute little to walking with passive elastic elements. In the model, the hip joint is actuated by a pair of Hill-type muscles, while the knee and ankle joints are antagonistically actuated by muscle and spring. The effectiveness of the proposed model in realizing economical bipedal walking is demonstrated by simulation.","","978-1-5386-9245-5","10.1109/IRC.2019.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675612","bipedal walking;muscle function;musculoskeletal model;passive dynamics;energy economical walking","Legged locomotion;Muscles;Knee;Hip;Acceleration","gait analysis;humanoid robots;medical robotics;muscle;orthopaedics;physiological models","bio-inspired musculoskeletal model;lower limb;energy economical bipedal walking;humanoid robots;muscle-actuated walking simulation;body propulsion;hip flexor;hip extensor;knee extensor;ankle plantar flexor;knee flexor;hip joint;Hill-type muscles;ankle joints;open-source software;ankle dorsiflexor;2D musculoskeletal model;OpenSim","","1","","27","","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from classical addressed scheduling techniques and considering asynchronous mechanism to handle tasks, we analyze the possibility of decoupling event listening from task creation and scheduling, actions that can be put into a peer-peer relation over a network or to client-server in Cloud. We consider multiple independent tasks sources that follow with a specific distribution. We will prove in this paper that for a scheduler in a Cloud these independent sources could be considered as a single one.

In this model, there is no requirement for low-resistance connections between the cells, and the major assumption is that the pre-and postjunctional membranes are ordinary excitable membranes. The electric field that develops in the narrow junctional cleft between contiguous cells during the rising phase of the action potential in the prejunctional membrane acts to depolarize the postjunctional membrane to threshold. Propagation occurred down the entire chain of cells at a constant velocity of about 17.1 cm/s. Raising the extracellular resistances (ROL and ROR) along the entire chain up to fourfold slowed propagation only slightly. However, when the radial cleft resistance (RJC) was varied concomitantly, then there was a marked slowing of propagation velocity, e.g., to 3.3 cm/s in 4.0 X resistance. There was an optimal RJC value for peak velocity. The lowering of ROL and ROR up to eightfold has almost no effect on velocity. Raising RJC, ROL, and ROR for the middle two cells, up to 3 times the normal value slowed propagation in the ""sucrose-gap"" region; raising the resistance to 4 times or higher blocked propagation. Hence, the electric field model allows successful transmission of excitation down a long chain of cells, not connected by low-resistance tunnels, at a constant velocity, and propagation velocity is dependent particularly on RJC.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.1983.325068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4121521","","Extracellular;Sugar;Biomembranes;Educational institutions;Immune system;Biological system modeling;Mathematics;Physiology;Electric resistance;Myocardium","","","Electrophysiology;Heart Conduction System;Mathematics;Models, Cardiovascular","15","","15","","12 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of a difference between humanoid hands and ordinary manipulators in grasp planning is that humanoid hands has no more than five fingers, which means five contact points in maximal. However, if the same object is grasped by an ordinary manipulator, the contact points number will not be used as a grasp optimization constraint. In order to achieve the requirement of as few touch points as possible for humanoid hands, this paper propose a grasp optimization method with constraint of contact points number, and then determines and solves the optimization function according to certain methods. In this paper, we use human's action (Thumb Two-Finger) as an example. First, a mathematical model is established based on this action; Second, we use the minimum wrench as an optimization target to create a linear constraint equation by pseudo-distance method; Then transfer it into a linear unconstrained function by penalty function method.

As robot joint trajectories are not explicitly encoded in CGDA, Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are used for the execution of these actions. These computations usually require a large number of evaluations. As a consequence of this, these evaluations are performed in a simulated environment, and the computed trajectory is then transferred to the physical robot. In this paper, constraints are introduced in the CGDA framework, as a way to reduce the number of evaluations needed by the system to converge to the optimal robot joint trajectory. Specifically, spatial and velocity constraints are introduced in the framework. Their effects in two different CGDA commonly studied use cases (the “wax” and “paint” actions) are analyzed and compared. The experimental results obtained using these constraints are compared with those obtained with the Steady State Tournament (SST) algorithm used in the original proposal of CGDA. Conclusions extracted from this study depict a high reduction in the required number of evaluations when incorporating spatial constraints. Velocity constraints provide however less promising results, which will be discussed within the context of previous CGDA works.","","978-1-5090-6234-8","10.1109/ICARSC.2017.7964090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964090","","Trajectory;Ions;Paints","angular velocity control;genetic algorithms;optimal control;robots;time series;trajectory control","CGDA execution;genetic algorithms;spatial constraints;velocity constraints;continuous goal directed actions framework;time series;robot joint trajectories;evolutionary algorithms;EA;computed trajectory;physical robot;optimal robot joint trajectory;steady state tournament algorithm;SST algorithm","","","","17","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We draw on these advances to develop a conceptual and architectural framework that enables efficient projection in time and space of intermingled manipulation and cognition tasks. Where AI-based autonomous systems have previously been concerned with human supervisory intervention primarily at a cognitive level, we add methods for rendezvous, capture and rehandoff of embedded manipulation tasks. Where telerobotics has been concerned with the projection of sensory-motor manipulation, we add the projection of cognitive processing. Thus extended, the two technologies mirror one another and merge into one of ""tele-autonomous systems"". We introduce notions of how the sensory, cognitive and motor functions of tele-autonomous systems can be factored and transferred back and forth between human and machine. We illustrate how the times to complete tele-autonomous tasks can be reduced through time and space constraint relaxations effected through simple controls: We employ the concepts of forward simulation and predictor display, augmented by ""time and position clutches"", ""time ratio controls"" and ""time brakes"", to control the resulting manipulation paths and event transitions.

As a result of stimulation to selected shoulder and elbow muscles, individuals are able to increase their range of motion, their reaching ability, and improve their overall shoulder stability. An approach that provides a natural way of controlling arm stimulation is proposed. The controller extracts information from recorded EMG activity of muscles under retained voluntary control and processes these signals to generate the appropriate stimulation levels for the stimulated paralyzed muscles. One subject with complete C5 paralysis has been implemented with this advanced neuroprosthesis which includes four implanted EMG electrodes and 24 channels of stimulation. Eight of these channels were used for hand grasp and six were used for trunk stimulation to provide posture control, trunk stability and weight relief. The shoulder and elbow implanted stimulation channels include the suprascapular, thoracodorsal and radial nerves (via nerve-cuff electrodes) and the pectoralis major, rhomboids and pronator quadratus muscles (via muscle-based electrodes). The thoracic portion of the pectoralis major was transferred to the scapula to restore the actions of the denervated serratus anterior muscle, essential for reaching tasks and shoulder stability. The four EMG channels implanted include the trapezius, biceps, deltoids and extensor carpi radialis longus. Currently, the EMG control strategy is being refined and tested with the subject including evaluation of the functional benefits of the intervention.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352819","","Spinal cord injury;Extremities;Muscles;Electromyography;Stability;Electrodes;Elbow;Neuromuscular stimulation;Data mining;Process control","biomedical electrodes;bone;electromyography;medical control systems;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;prosthetics","EMG-based control;C5-C6 spinal cord injury;upper extremity neuroprosthesis;functional electrical stimulation;cervical midlevel spinal cord injury;hand function;shoulder muscles;elbow muscles;shoulder stability;arm stimulation;paralyzed muscles;implanted EMG electrodes;trunk stimulation;posture control;hand grasp;implanted stimulation channels;suprascapular nerve;thoracodorsal nerve;radial nerve;pectoralis major;rhomboids;pronator quadratus muscles;scapula;serratus anterior muscle;reaching tasks;trapezius;biceps;deltoids;extensor carpi radialis longus","Arm;Biomechanical Phenomena;Biomechanical Phenomena;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes, Implanted;Electromyography;Electromyography;Equipment Design;Hand Strength;Humans;Muscles;Prostheses and Implants;Shoulder;Spinal Cord Injuries;Spinal Cord Injuries;Upper Extremity","5","1","8","","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, these networks are deployed in an unprotected environment to sense the physical world, and perform reliable actions on it. Hence, these networks are always susceptible to various kinds of passive and active attacks by malicious nodes. The back hole and gray hole attacks are part of active attacks. These attacks degrade the network efficiency and performance. In this paper, an efficient trust based secured coordination mechanism is proposed to counter the black hole and gray hole attacks on the delay and energy efficient routing protocol in sensor-actor networks. In the proposed mechanism, each sensor analyzes the trust level of its 1 - hop sensors based on the experience, recommendation, and knowledge. The analyzed trust value is transferred to the actor. The actor analyzes these values to identify the malicious nodes in its cluster region. The proposed trust based secured coordination mechanism (TBSC) is simulated using NS2. The performance is analyzed with respect to packet delivery ratio, average energy dissipation in the network, and average end-to-end delay. The simulation results reveal that TBSC mechanism performs well for the delay and energy efficient routing protocol compared to the existing security mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-1823-2","10.1109/SPICES.2015.7091460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091460","Black hole;Energy;Gray hole;Sensor;Trust","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Delays;Energy dissipation;Monitoring;Ad hoc networks;Wireless communication","routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","trust based secured coordination mechanism;WSAN;wireless sensor-actor networks;passive attacks;active attacks;malicious nodes;back hole attacks;gray hole attacks;network efficiency degradation;network performance degradation;energy efficient routing protocol;trust level;trust value;cluster region;packet deliv- ery ratio;average energy dissipation;average end-to-end delay;TBSC mechanism;NS2 simulation","","","","16","","23 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DSC supplies harmonic current into diode rectifier system so that the shape of diode rectifier current can be adjusted, and the corresponding ripple power is transferred to floating capacitor. The action of DSC also intends to stabilize the system which has negative impedance characteristic caused by constant power load (CPL).

The converter is capable of increased power transfer due to its three-phase power configuration, and it reduces the rms current per phase, thus reducing conduction losses. Further, interleaved operation of three-phase boost converter reduces overall ripple current, which is imposed into fuel cells and realizes smaller sized filter components, increasing effective operating frequency and leading to higher power density. Each output current of three-phase boost converter is combined by the three-phase transformer and flows in the continuous conduction mode by the proposed three-phase PWM strategy. An efficiency of above 96% is mainly achieved by reducing conduction losses and switching losses are reduced by the action of active clamp branches, as well. The proposed converter and three-phase PWM strategy are analyzed, simulated and implemented in hardware. Experimental results are obtained on a 500 W prototype unit, with all of the design verified and analyzed.","2377-6617","978-1-4244-1667-7","10.1109/PESC.2008.4592106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4592106","three-phase dc/dc converter;isolated boost converter;interleaved operation;continuous conduction mode;three-phase PWM strategy","Clamps;Converters;Inductors;DC-DC power converters;Inductance;Fuel cells;Pulse width modulation","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;switching convertors","three-phase interleaved isolated boost converter;active clamp converter;fuel cells;three-phase high power dc/dc converter;power transfer;three-phase power configuration;conduction losses;three-phase transformer;three-phase PWM strategy;switching losses","","9","","6","","8 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially, NMPZs bring some delays to the system making the system to be unstable in large gains. In this article, the aim is to recognize the existence of NMPZs in high voltage direct current (HVDC) lines imbedded into AC grids and to develop a method to cancel out their effects. Subsequently, the process on two real power grids with two different HVDC models are examined to detect the possible NMPZs in their dynamics. Accomplishing linear and nonlinear simulations in Matlab and Eurostag, the location of unstable zeros are determined. Then, a benchmark model is adopted to identify the affecting parameters of the power system on the occurrence of the NMPZs. The analysis concludes that the NMPZs can appear in the system as short-circuit power at connection points of HVDC line and generators. Finally, to avoid the harmful effects of theses NMPZs, a modified zero phase error compensator (MZPEC) is proposed, which is noise insensitive in the control loop. Simulation results reveal that the use of the provided MZPEC along with a classic power oscillation damping (POD) controller can greatly improve the action of the POD and, therefore, can increase the power transfer quality of the grid.","","978-1-5386-8218-0","10.1109/ISGTEurope.2019.8905703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8905703","Non-minimum phase zero;High voltage direct current link;Power network;Damping controller;Zero phase error compensator","","HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;power grids;power supply quality","HVDC links;nonminimum phase zeros;high voltage direct current lines;power grids;modified zero phase error compensator;power transfer quality;nonminimum phase behavior;nonlinear AC grids;HVDC line;power oscillation damping controller","","","","14","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper takes a step in this direction, with the introduction of Charades-Ego, a large-scale dataset of paired first-person and third-person videos, involving 112 people, with 4000 paired videos. This enables learning the link between the two, actor and observer perspectives. Thereby, we address one of the biggest bottlenecks facing egocentric vision research, providing a link from first-person to the abundant third-person data on the web.

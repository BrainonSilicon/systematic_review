Compared to standard repetitive schemes, the new relevant feature of the proposed control is that the learning scheme is reduced to a simple intrinsically stable transfer function, whose poles lie on the left-hand-side of the complex plane. Hence, storing a considerable amount of samples is no longer required, while resetting procedures are no longer involved. The Padé-based-repetitive control has a simple structure, while being able to automatically compensate for any periodic disturbance signals coming from external generators and dead-time. A stability analysis is reported, providing a useful guidance to tune the control parameters. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2329-3748","978-1-4799-7312-5","10.1109/ECCE.2018.8557452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8557452","Repetitive Control;Padé Function;Voltage Source Inverter;Current Control","","adaptive control;approximation theory;closed loop systems;compensation;electric current control;invertors;learning systems;stability;tracking;transfer functions;voltage control","Padé-based-repetitive learning current-control;voltage source inverters;power converters;periodic reference signal;periodic disturbance signals;control parameters;intrinsically stable transfer function;complex plane;stability analysis","","","","22","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach does not rely on a specific inverse kinematic solution. In the learning problem, the number of driving error signals (in the task space) is strictly less than the number of inputs to be determined (in the joint space). During the iterative process, control effort is transferred from a linear feedback law designed for the end-effector error to the learned feedforward term. Joint velocity damping stabilizes the closed loop system. The basic learning algorithm is designed in the frequency domain, while a digital implementation of the necessary signal filtering improves the speed and uniformity of convergence of the learning performance. Simulations are reported for a three-link planar manipulator. The inclusion of a kinematic singularity avoidance scheme is also illustrated.<>","","0-8186-2163-X","10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=131818","","Manipulator dynamics;Kinematics;Orbital robotics;Linear feedback control systems;Process control;Error correction;Damping;Closed loop systems;Iterative algorithms;Filtering algorithms","closed loop systems;frequency-domain analysis;iterative methods;learning systems;position control;robots","joint velocity damping;learning systems;redundant manipulators;robot dynamic model;driving error signals;iterative process;linear feedback;closed loop system;frequency domain;signal filtering;kinematic singularity avoidance","","10","","15","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One particular interesting application with robot swarms is autonomous object assembly. Such tasks have been solved successfully with robot swarms that are controlled by a human operator using a light source. In this paper, we present a method to solve such assembly tasks autonomously based on policy search methods. We split the assembly process in two subtasks: generating a high-level assembly plan and learning a low-level object movement policy. The assembly policy plans the trajectories for each object and the object movement policy controls the trajectory execution. Learning the object movement policy is challenging as it depends on the complex state of the swarm which consists of an individual state for each agent. To approach this problem, we introduce a representation of the swarm which is based on Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. This representation is invariant to the number of agents in the swarm as well as to the allocation of an agent to its position in the swarm. These invariances make the learned policy robust to changes in the swarm and also reduce the search space for the policy search method significantly. We show that the resulting system is able to solve assembly tasks with varying object shapes in multiple simulation scenarios and evaluate the robustness of our representation to changes in the swarm size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policies learned in simulation are robust enough to be transferred to real robots.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-3081-5","10.1109/ICRA.2018.8463215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8463215","","Robot sensing systems;Task analysis;Light sources;Robustness;Kernel;Trajectory","Hilbert spaces;learning systems;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;robotic assembly;robust control;search problems","swarm size;robust policies learning;Hilbert space embeddings;policy search methods;low-level object movement policy;high-level assembly plan;assembly process;policy search method;autonomous object assembly;swarm robotics;robot swarms;object manipulation","","","","28","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such conditions, the target object touches or is covered by adjacent obstacle objects, thus rendering traditional grasping techniques ineffective. In this paper, we propose a pushing policy aiming at singulating the target object from its surrounding clutter, by means of lateral pushing movements of both the neighboring objects and the target object until sufficient 'grasping room' has been achieved. To achieve the above goal we employ reinforcement learning and particularly Deep Qlearning (DQN) to learn optimal push policies by trial and error. A novel Split DQN is proposed to improve the learning rate and increase the modularity of the algorithm. Experiments show that although learning is performed in a simulated environment the transfer of learned policies to a real environment is effective thanks to robust feature selection. Finally, we demonstrate that the modularity of the algorithm allows the addition of extra primitives without retraining the model from scratch.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196647","","Grasping;Task analysis;Clutter;Image segmentation;Robustness;Service robots","collision avoidance;grippers;learning systems;manipulators;neurocontrollers","policy learning;split deep Q-learning;robust object singulation;robotic manipulation;robotic applications;grasping techniques;pushing policy;lateral pushing movements;reinforcement learning;optimal push policies;split DQN;target object extraction","","","","23","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous synthetic studies have proposed learning methods for gaze following without any explicit instructions as the first step to understand the development of these actions. However, a robot was given a priori knowledge about which pair of sensory information and action should be associated. This paper addresses the development of social actions without such knowledge with a learning mechanism that iteratively acquires social actions by finding and reproducing the contingency inherent in the interaction with a caregiver. The measurement of contingency based on transfer entropy is used to find appropriate pairs of variables for acquiring social actions from possible candidates. The reproduction of found contingency promotes a change of contingent structure in the subsequent actions of a caregiver and a robot. In computer simulations of human-robot interaction, we examine what kinds of actions related to joint attention can be acquired in which order by controlling the behavior of caregiver agents. The result shows that a robot acquires joint attention related actions in an order that resembles an infantpsilas development of joint attention.","2161-9476","978-1-4244-2661-4","10.1109/DEVLRN.2008.4640839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4640839","joint attention;transfer entropy;contingent chain;sequential acquisition of social behavior","Robots;Robot sensing systems;Joints;Face;Detectors;Reliability;Pediatrics","artificial intelligence;biocommunications;biocybernetics;information theory;learning systems;robots","joint attention related action development;interaction contingency reproduction;gaze following;gaze alternation;communication;learning methods;learning mechanism;social action acquisition;interaction contingency search;contingency measurement;transfer entropy;contingent structure change;human-robot interaction","","7","","11","","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model includes several key aspects of the actual machine dynamics including stick-slip friction, time delays, nonlinear valve flow characteristics, and deadzones. A feedforward control input is determined via an iterative learning control scheme. This input is combined with either a feedback strategy or an open-loop strategy for the filling and packing control phases, respectively. The time delay, which exists in both stages, is accounted for by time shifting the learning feedforward signal relative to the feedback control signal.

In clinic cure, voluntary movements are encouraged to accelerate the recovery. However, for the rehabilitation system based on functional electrical stimulation (FES), voluntary movements are unpredictable and act as input disturbance, which would reduce the control precision. In addition, an accurate model of the human musculoskeletal dynamics is usually not available. In this paper, the upper-limb rehabilitation is described first and simplified to a linear nominal model. To deal with the aperiodic voluntary movements and model uncertainty, disturbance observer (DOB) is introduced as the inner-loop of the rehabilitation control system. The suppression of DOB for voluntary movements and model uncertainty is analysed in frequency domain. The stability of DOB is discussed and a criterion is given.

In computer-based environments, where learners interact only with a computer and do not have access to direct support from a teacher, learners need to be provided with instructional prompts or just-in-time help intended to encourage more active example processing during learning. This study investigated whether it was more beneficial to provide the learners access to on-demand (self-regulated) help after they committed an error in problem solving or for the learning environment to regulate the presentation of instructional help externally. Furthermore, two different presentational formats-textual and pictorial-of instructional prompts were examined. This study was conducted with a computer-based learning environment that introduced high school students without any prior content-specific knowledge to the principles of parallel and series circuit analysis. Textual prompts facilitated practice problem solving notably better than pictorial prompts. Overall, textual-based prompts produced a large effect on near transfer. A significant format of prompts by academic ability interaction was discovered on near transfer. In particular, lower-ability learners scored significantly better when given textual prompts; whereas, their higher-ability counterparts performed equally well with both formats. Moreover, learners provided with externally regulated prompts reported significantly more positive attitudes toward the prompts in general compared to learners in the self-regulated conditions. Finally, continuous motivation was significantly stronger in learners who viewed textual prompts than in their counterparts in the pictorial prompt groups.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2005.852602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495662","Backward fading;computer-based learning environment;electrical circuit analysis;external control;high school;instructional prompts;learner control;pictorial format;textual format","Electronics engineering education;Circuit simulation;Computer aided instruction","electronic engineering education;circuit analysis computing;computer aided instruction","instructional prompts;electrical circuit analysis;computer-based learning environment;high school students;parallel circuit analysis;series circuit analysis;textual prompts;pictorial prompts","","15","","21","","15 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the beam flexibility of the long vertical links, the precision performance of the end-effector may be severely degraded especially when robots are out-stretching. Normally there is no actuation degree of freedom on the link of deflection to directly compensate for the vibration. Hence, control action is applied to other actuation degrees of freedom based on the kinematic study of the vibration. Specifically, an ILC scheme is employed to off-line modify the reference trajectory of these robot joints for the next iteration based on prior position measurements of the end-effector and the kinematic relationships between the joints and the end-effector.

However, recent studies indicate that such mechanisms show limitations in their applicability to dynamic systems. This paper investigates how to mitigate such restrictions using a neural network to control a grid-connected rectifier/inverter. The neural network implements a dynamic programming algorithm and is trained by using backpropagation through time. To enhance performance and stability under disturbance, additional strategies are adopted, including the use of integrals of error signals to the network inputs and the introduction of grid disturbance voltage to the outputs of a well-trained network. The performance of the neural-network controller is studied under typical vector control conditions and compared against conventional vector control methods, which demonstrates that the neural vector control strategy proposed in this paper is effective. Even in dynamic and power converter switching environments, the neural vector controller shows strong ability to trace rapidly changing reference commands, tolerate system disturbances, and satisfy control requirements for a faulted power system.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280906","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612721","Backpropagation through time;decoupled vector control;dynamic programming;grid-connected rectifier/inverter;neural controller;renewable energy conversion systems","Voltage control;Vectors;Neural networks;Control systems;Standards;Tuning;Inverters","backpropagation;dynamic programming;invertors;learning systems;neurocontrollers;power convertors;power grids;power system control;power system faults;power system stability;rectifiers;renewable energy sources;time-varying systems","artificial neural networks;grid-connected rectifier control;grid-connected inverter control;dynamic switching condition;power converter switching condition;three-phase grid-connected converters;renewable power system application;electric power system application;standard decoupled d-q vector control mechanism;dynamic system;dynamic programming algorithm;backpropagation;performance enhancement;stability;error signal integrals;grid disturbance voltage;neural-network controller;neural vector control;power converter switching environment;rapidly changing reference commands;system disturbance tolerance;control requirements;faulted power system","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electric Power Supplies;Electricity;Energy Transfer;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Feedback;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Power Plants;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","57","","58","","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thirty healthy young participants walked in the robotic exoskeleton Lokomat, while learning a foot target-tracking task which required an increased hip and knee flexion in the dominant leg. Learning with three different strategies was evaluated: (i) No guidance: no disturbance/guidance was applied, (ii) Haptic error amplification: dangerous and discouraging large errors were limited with haptic guidance, while awareness of task relevant errors was enhanced with error amplification, and (iii) Visual error amplification: visually perceived errors were amplified in a virtual reality environment. We also evaluated whether increasing the movement variability during training by adding randomly-varying haptic disturbances on top of the other training strategies further enhanced learning. We found that training with the novel haptic error amplification strategy limited large errors during training, did not hamper learning and enhanced transfer of the learned asymmetric gait pattern. Training with visual error amplification, on the other hand, increased errors during training and hampered motor learning. Adding haptic disturbances did not have a significant effect on learning. The novel haptic error modulating controller that amplifies small task-relevant errors while limiting large errors provided the best framework to enhance motor learning.","2155-1782","978-1-5386-8183-1","10.1109/BIOROB.2018.8488011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8488011","","Training;Haptic interfaces;Legged locomotion;Visualization;Task analysis;Trajectory","gait analysis;haptic interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","task-relevant errors;visual error modulating controllers;haptic error modulating controllers;novel haptic error modulating controller;hampered motor learning;increased errors;learned asymmetric gait pattern;enhanced transfer;novel haptic error amplification strategy;enhanced learning;haptic disturbances;visually perceived errors;visual error amplification;task relevant errors;haptic guidance;disturbance/guidance;different strategies;knee flexion;increased hip;foot target-tracking task;robotic exoskeleton Lokomat;thirty healthy young participants;motor training;promising training strategies;augment movement errors;robotic algorithms;robotic gait training","","","","26","","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The output of a fuzzy conjunction unit is computed by taking the minimum of all its inputs. The approach uses hill-climbing search at conjunction units where the backpropagation rule fails to apply because the transfer function is not differentiable. Error propagation at conjunction units requires analysis of error dependency across conjunction. When there are multiple alternatives for error adaptation at a conjunction unit, the choice is the one that allows the system to be modified the best. This approach is evaluated by simulation and compared with the approach which turns a conjunction unit into a pi unit.

With the help of this method, the robot can not only complete the task autonomously after teaching, but also can learn the details of demonstrator's behavior.","","978-1-5090-6575-2","10.1109/ICMIC.2017.8321615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8321615","Robot Teaching;Teleoperation;radial basis function (RBF) network","Service robots;Education;Robot sensing systems;Radial basis function networks;Mathematical model","computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radial basis function networks;robot programming;telerobotics","Robot teaching;teleoperation;visual interaction;neural network learning;human demonstrators;teaching pendant;learning algorithm;radial basis function network;Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform;V-REP","","1","","22","","22 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An iterative learning control algorithm for portability between trajectories","X. Gao; S.

Because of its ease of implementation and robustness, ILC has found widespread use in a variety of industrial applications. However, a key limitation of ILC is the requirement that learning has to be re-initiated for each new trajectory, since the tuned control input corresponds to a specific reference trajectory. Thus, the entire tuning process needs to be repeated to generate a new control input even with slight changes in the reference trajectory. This problem is especially critical for applications where the motion trajectories required for different tasks are different. In this paper, we address this issue by designing an algorithm for iteratively learning a system dynamics-related model that is portable from one trajectory to another, namely, a finite length approximation of the impulse response of the inverse of the system. This learned approximation of the inverse model can then be transferred to a new trajectory without relearning. We present theoretical development of convergence, robustness, and performance bounds of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified both in simulation and implementation on a high precision positioning stage.","2378-5861","978-1-4799-3274-0","10.1109/ACC.2014.6859281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859281","Iterative learning control;Learning;Optimization","Trajectory;Approximation methods;Approximation algorithms;Training;Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing","adaptive control;control system synthesis;feedforward;iterative methods;learning systems;trajectory control","iterative learning control algorithm;ILC algorithms;feedforward control input;control tuning process;reference trajectory;motion trajectories;system dynamics-related model;high precision positioning stage","","9","","16","","21 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The best existing robot planners are based on random sampling of configuration space- which becomes excessively high-dimensional with large number of objects. Consequently, most planners often fail to efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract the decision making, irrespective of the number of obstacles. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of waypoints in task space. These waypoints provided a high-level plan, which could be transferred to an arbitrary robot model and used to initialise a local trajectory optimiser. We evaluated this approach through testing on unseen human VR data, a physics-based robot simulation, and a real robot (dataset and code are publicly available1). We found that the human-like planner outperformed a state-of-the-art standard trajectory optimisation algorithm, and was able to generate effective strategies for rapid planning- irrespective of the number of obstacles in the environment.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196665","","Task analysis;Planning;Robots;Testing;Feature extraction;Trajectory;Standards","collision avoidance;decision making;dexterous manipulators;grippers;learning (artificial intelligence);planning (artificial intelligence);robot programming;robot vision;trajectory control;virtual reality","decision making;decision classifiers;cluttered environments;robot planners;random sampling;object manipulation plans;virtual reality;trajectory optimisation;physics based robot simulation;human-like planning;depth camera;Robotiq two finger gripper","","","","31","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is implemented using two separate networks, one for the actor and one for the critic, but with similar structures. In addition to convolutional and fully connected layers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are included to address the limited observability present in the problem. As a proof of concept, we consider the case of robotic soccer using humanoid NAO V5 robots, which have reduced computational capabilities, and low-cost Red - Green - Blue (RGB) cameras as main sensors. The use of DRL allowed to obtain a complex and high performant policy from scratch, without any prior knowledge of the domain, or the dynamics involved.

Many tasks, such as use of hand tools, involve significant interaction forces between hand and environment. One control strategy would be to use high hand impedance to reduce sensitivity to these forces. But an alternative would be to learn feedback compensation for the extrinsic dynamics and associated interaction forces, with the potential for lower control effort. We observed subjects as they learned control of a ball-and-beam system, a visuo-motor task where the goal was to quickly position a ball rolling atop a rotating beam, through manual rotation of the beam alone. We devised a ball-and-beam apparatus that could be operated in a real mode, where a physical ball was present; or in a virtual training mode, where the ball's dynamics were simulated in real time. The apparatus presented the same visual feedback in all cases, and optionally produced haptic feedback of the interaction forces associated with the ball's motion. Two healthy adult subject groups, vision-only and vision-haptics (each n=10), both trained for 80 trials on the simulated system, and then were evaluated on the real system to test for skill transfer effects. If humans incorporate interaction forces in their learning, the vision-haptics group would be expected to exhibit a smoother transfer, as quantified by changes in completion time of a ball-positioning task. During training, both groups adapted well to the task, with reductions of 64%-70% in completion time. At skill transfer to the real system, the vision-only group had a significant 35% increase in completion time (p<0.05). There was no significant change in the vision-haptics group, indicating that subjects had learned to compensate for interaction forces. These forces could potentially be incorporated in virtual environments to assist with motor training or rehabilitation","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2006.881533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703571","Feedback control;haptic interface;motor adaptation;motor control;object manipulation;upper extremity","Humans;Force feedback;Haptic interfaces;Neurofeedback;Muscles;Force control;Virtual environment;Sensor arrays;Testing;Impedance","biomechanics;feedback;haptic interfaces;medical control systems;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality;vision","human adaptation;interaction forces;visuo-motor coordination;contact tasks;hand tools;high hand impedance;feedback compensation;ball-and-beam system;visual feedback;haptic feedback;ball-positioning task;motor training;rehabilitation","Adaptation, Physiological;Feedback;Humans;Motor Skills;Movement;Muscle, Skeletal;Musculoskeletal Equilibrium;Stress, Mechanical;Task Performance and Analysis;Touch;Upper Extremity;Visual Perception","15","","20","","18 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While physical camera motion exhibits subtle details of position, rotation, and acceleration, these details are often missing for virtual camera motion. In this work, we analyze camera movement using signal theory. Our system allows us to stylize a smooth user-defined virtual base camera motion by enriching it with plausible details. A key component of our system is a database of videos filmed by physical cameras. These videos are analyzed with a camera-motion estimation algorithm (structure-from-motion) and labeled manually with a specific style. By considering spectral properties of location, orientation and acceleration, our solution learns camera motion details. Consequently, an arbitrary virtual base motion, defined in any conventional animation package, can be automatically modified according to a user-selected style. As shown in our experiments, the resulting shots are still fully artist-controlled, but appear richer and more physically plausible.","","978-1-4244-8872-8","10.1109/CVMP.2010.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693126","style transfer;camera shake;camera motion estimation;structure-from-motion","Cameras;Videos;Databases;Animation;Time frequency analysis;Motion pictures;Three dimensional displays","cameras;image motion analysis;virtual reality","camera motion style transfer;virtual worlds;physical worlds;camera movement;scene immersion;user-defined virtual base camera motion;camera-motion estimation algorithm","","","","39","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A network using both supervised and unsupervised training is proposed, consisting of a combination of ART2 and BP. ART2 is used to build and focus a supervised backpropagation network consisting of many small subnetworks each specialized on a particular domain of the input space. The ABT2/BP network has the advantage of being able to dynamically expand itself in response to input patterns containing new information.

In wafer scanners, synchronization of the wafer and reticle stages is critical for accurate pattern transfer. For synchronization, a master-slave configuration is used, with the wafer stage acting as the master, and the reticle stage as the slave. Since the scanning process is repetitive, ILC is used to improve tracking performance. However, the coupling between the reticle stage and wafer stage is unidirectional. Hence we propose an ILC scheme that takes into account this structural property of the overall system. A simple design procedure is presented which allows design of the ILC system for the wafer and reticle stages independently. This is done by first designing an ILC controller for the wafer (master) stage, and then using the synchronization error for ILC update for the reticle (slave) stage. Analytic conditions for stability and monotonic error convergence are then discussed. Finally, design and performance of the algorithm is illustrated by implementation on a single degree of freedom wafer stage, and a virtual (computer-simulated) reticle stage.","2378-5861","978-1-4244-2078-0","10.1109/ACC.2008.4587103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587103","","Control design;Master-slave;Control systems;Service robots;Lithography;Computer errors;Error correction;Convergence;MIMO;Stability analysis","control system synthesis;electronics industry;iterative methods;learning systems;photolithography;reticles;semiconductor device manufacture;semiconductor technology","iterative learning control design;synchronization;wafer stage;reticle stage;controller design;wafer scanning system;pattern transfer;master-slave configuration;repetitive scanning process;stability;monotonic error convergence","","21","1","15","","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Iterative Learning Controller learns to generate the desired set of input signals to compensate for the output tracking errors. Conventionally the performance of ILC algorithms has been based on the convergence of the output tracking error. In this paper, the convergence of the control input is investigated down to the sample-time level. Two scenarios are considered: Firstly, when the control input is updated with same initial conditions at the start of each batch/repetition/iteration/trial and secondly for varying initial conditions. The batch to batch evolution of control inputs at each sample time within a batch is formulated. Convergence of the control input signals has been based on the Eigen analysis of this relationship. This provides deeper insight about the ILC algorithms and exact factors affecting the convergence could be monitored. Limits of the learning process are clearly demonstrated as well. Performance of D-type & PD-type ILC algorithms has been investigated for a simple pendulum and further extended to bipedal locomotion. Bipedal walking robot is an interesting control problem but involves complexity being a hybrid system. It comprises of single support, impact with ground and double support phases. The non-linear impacts pose challenge since they cause non-zero initial errors for each step. For reasons of energy efficiency, passive dynamics has been chosen for compass gait model of the biped. Stable gait achieved from a fine-tuned PD controller provides the set of desired inputs for the joints of the compass gait robot. ILC learns/adapts the joint control for repetitive gaits. It represents learning a sequence of action by muscles. Due to the transfer of state error in a cyclic manner from the end of a previous step/repetition to the recent step/repetition, the convergence has to be established in joint control and state space. The steady gait is achieved for bipedal locomotion on flat surface as demonstrated through simulations.","2151-1411","978-1-4577-1929-5","10.1109/IBCAST.2012.6177517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177517","Cyclic Iterative Learning Control;Convergence;bipedal walking robot","Clocks","gait analysis;iterative methods;learning systems;legged locomotion;motion control;path planning;PD control","convergence analysis;cyclic iterative learning control scheme;output tracking error;control input convergence;sample-time level;batch to batch evolution;control input signal;eigen analysis;learning process;PD-type ILC algorithm;bipedal locomotion;bipedal walking robot;hybrid system complexity;nonlinear impacts;nonzero initial error;energy efficiency;passive dynamics;compass gait model;fine-tuned PD controller;compass gait robot;muscles action;state error transfer;state space","","2","","27","","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The obtained transfer function from RLS technique is used in the development of the control system for the idle speed control by PID controllers. The main objective of the idle speed control is to maintain the idling speed at 650rpm and to reject as quickly as possible the extra load exerted on the engine system during idling mode.

The process begins by having the students conduct individual research on one of a finite list of topics and produce a poster that details what they have learned. We collect the research posters and transfer the media into the shared virtual world of second life, where a developer organizes the posters into a ldquovirtual museumrdquo of full-color high-quality panels displaying the studentspsila creations. Students return to the computer lab, log in to the virtual world, and explore the virtual gallery.

A consortium formed by five European universities decided to join efforts to provide to the community a federation, which could be used by different stakeholders interest in teaching, learning or developing new skills in the field of electronics. The proposed remote system, Virtual Instruments System in Reality, or VISIR in short, offers the possibility of working with real equipment and obtain the real-world/ real-time measurements. By developing such a VISIR federation some of the constraints of using remote labs, the ones associated with development and maintenance costs, and scalability, will be minimized.

The optimized weights of the proposed ANN structure are then directly utilized to model the unknown system, in terms of an equivalent discrete transfer function model.

We present a real-robot dataset which allows to systematically investigate this question. This dataset contains trajectories of a 3 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot being controlled by a diverse set of policies. For comparison, we also provide a simulated version of the dataset. Finally, we benchmark a few widely-used dynamics-learning methods using the proposed dataset. Our results show that the iid test error of a learned model is not necessarily a good indicator of its accuracy under control policies different from the one which generated the training data.

While many studies in RL focus on varying the observation space or reward model, few efforts focused on the choice of action space (e.g. joint or end-effector space, position, velocity, etc.). However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space that conforms to the characteristics of the task can simplify exploration and improve robustness to disturbances. This paper studies the effect of different action spaces in deep RL and advocates for variable impedance control in end-effector space (VICES) as an advantageous action space for constrained and contact-rich tasks. We evaluate multiple action spaces on three prototypical manipulation tasks: Path Following (task with no contact), Door Opening (task with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact). We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy consumption, and ensures safety across all three experimental setups. Further, RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in simulation, and from simulation to real for the same robot.

Our proposed method requires a motion trajectory obtained from human demonstrations via a Kinect sensor, which is then projected onto a corresponding human skeleton model. The kinematics mapping between the robot and the human model is learned by employing Local Procrustes Analysis, which enables the transfer of the demonstrated trajectory from the human model to the robot. Finally, the transferred trajectory is modeled using Dynamic Movement Primitives, allowing it to be reproduced in real time.

The concept has been successfully applied to non-STEM courses, however it is more or less limited to on-site courses. Extending courses into the online medium allows students to design their learning based on their interests and demand while maintaining structured presentation and/or discussion of learning material. Peer Instruction's `peer discussion' phase cannot be non-trivially transferred into the online medium. Such transfer would allow for added value to on-site classes, especially for GEMS (girls in engineering, mathematics, and science) as well as challenged students as barriers keeping them from participating in discussion can be significantly reduced. Potential solutions to facilitate the transfer lie in heavily investigated solutions like clickers, or audience response systems. However, these solutions primarily aim at large audiences, namely readings. Our research investigates transferability of concepts into smaller on-site classes, namely tutorials. It discusses experimental results and concepts for a tech-enhanced peer discussion derivative utilisable in tutorials while providing anonymity and barrier-free access to discussions. At the same time, cognisant incidental utilisation (CIU) is impelled in order to maintain a focus on the actual on-site activities, only providing added value.

The results showed that a continuous audio feedback could help navigate in a VE without vision feedback.","","978-1-5090-0840-7","10.1109/WEVR.2016.7859538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859538","Assistive technology; HRTF; 3D Audio; user study","Visualization;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual environments;Navigation;Headphones;Haptic interfaces","feedback;human computer interaction;transfer functions;virtual reality;vision defects","spatial audio feedback;virtual environments;visual impairments;head related transfer function;HRTF;human-computer interaction;VE;diversified training environments might;position information;direction information","","1","","19","","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results from non-defense applications are also likely to be positive. The characteristics of networked simulation that are relevant to its transfer to non-defense applications include a focus on group performance, physical dispersion of participants, requirements for real-time response, emergent task environments, visual task environments, accessible performance data, provisions for practice, immersive realism, and interactions with many entities. These characteristics are matched with potential, non-defense applications of networked simulation such as training for crews, teams, and units, edutainment, education, training, school-to-work transitions, and lifelong learning.

"Assessment of open-ended geometry problems in dynamic geometry environments","İ. Yavuz; İ. Kepceoğlu; A. Kerpi̇ç","Marmara University, İstanbul, TURKEY; Marmara University, İstanbul, TURKEY; Marmara University, İstanbul, TURKEY","2014 World Congress on Computer Applications and Information Systems (WCCAIS)","7 Oct 2014","2014","","","1","2","Summary form only given. Assessment of student learning requires the use of techniques for measuring student achievement. Assessment is more than a collection of techniques, however. It is a systematic process that plays a significant role in effective teaching. It begins with the identification of learning goals, monitors the progress students make toward those goals, and ends with a judgment concerning the extent to which those goals have been attained [1]. Assessment can be classified in terms of their functional role in classroom instruction as follows: placement, formative, diagnostic and summative assessment [2]. In the literature, the integration of technological tools into the assessment process is expressed by the ""e-assessment"" concept [3,4,5]. Assessment using ICT has come to be known as e-assessment, which includes the entire assessment process, from designing assignments to storing the results with the help of ICT [5]. The most of the researches related to the e-assessment focused on how to transfer the examinations in paper-pencil environment to the electronic environment [4,5]. In addition to those studies, in the research about the integration of computer assisted assessment tools to the mathematics instruction, the participant pre-service teachers use these tools in favor of the formative assessment [6]. In a similar study, pre-service teachers prepared lessons and home works using technological tools such as dynamic geometry software and thus it is shown that those tools can be used in the process of assessment [7]. In the literature, there is numerous studies concerning technology supported mathematics instruction [8,9, I 0, 11]. But none of them is related to the assessment dimension of the mathematics teaching. In particular, it is highly recommended to conduct researches about the use of technology in that dimension [6,12,13]. The aim of this study is to determine some necessary points of assessment of computer based mathematics instruction. As this aim is related to a very large domain of research, this study focuses on only three open-ended geometry problems that can be solved in dynamic geometry environments. Case study is considered as the methodology of the research. The reason is that a case study investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life context when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident [14]. 30 pre-service mathematics teachers have participated to the study and have divided randomly into three groups. In each group, every pre-service teacher worked individually on one of the three problems during 30 minutes. At the same time, they explained their approaches to solve problems by filling out a paper. In addition, a screen capture program is used to grab the video of what is seen on the computer screen. Meanwhile the researchers observed pre-service teachers' work on computers. The findings of the study are revealed via the analysis of each video, of their comparison with the written explanations and of the researchers' observations. Based on the findings, the most significant result of the study is that the screen captures should be definitely used for the assessment in dynamic geometry environments; because all of pre-service teachers' work can only be seen in those videos. The final version of the saved file doesn't represent the whole tries that one pre-service teacher does while dealing with problems. Furthermore a rubric that depends on the time, the number of tools, the relation between the drawing and the construction must be absolutely used to give a score.","","978-1-4799-3351-8","10.1109/WCCAIS.2014.6916554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916554","","Abstracts;Computers","computer aided instruction;mathematics computing;teaching","open-ended geometry problem assessment;dynamic geometry environments;student learning assessment;student achievement measurement;effective teaching;classroom instruction;technological tool integration;e-assessment concept;ICT;paper-pencil environment;electronic environment;computer assisted assessment tools;formative assessment;dynamic geometry software;mathematics teaching;computer based mathematics instruction;screen capture program;computer screen","","","","14","","7 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, given that these plants usually have a fixed structure (normally first or second order models), the creation of control learning activities for different type and order plants are not possible. In this context, this paper presents a flexible educational plant which has been designed as a set of electronic modules based on operational amplifiers which can be combined to create different transfer functions (or plants) and perform PID control on it.

Many studies indicate that robot learning from demonstration (LfD) is a promising way to improve grasping performance, but complete automation of the grasping task in unforeseen circumstances remains difficult. As an alternative to LfD, this paper leverages limited human supervision to achieve robotic grasping of unknown objects in unforeseen circumstances. The technical question is what form of human supervision best minimizes the effort of the human supervisor. The approach here applies a human-supplied bounding box to focus the robot's visual processing on the target object, thereby lessening the dimensionality of the robot's computer vision processing. After the human supervisor defines the bounding box through the man-machine interface, the rest of the grasping task is automated through a vision-based feature-extraction approach where the dexterous hand learns to grasp objects without relying on pre-computed object models through the NEAT neuroevolution algorithm. Given only low-level sensing data from a commercial depth sensor Kinect, our approach evolves neural networks to identify appropriate hand positions and orientations for grasping novel objects. Further, the machine learning results from simulation have been validated by transferring the training results to a physical robot called Dreamer made by the Meka Robotics company. The results demonstrate that grasping novel objects through exploiting neuroevolution from simulation to reality is possible.","2328-1464","978-1-4799-4530-6","10.1109/CICA.2014.7013242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013242","","Grasping;Robot sensing systems;Training;Artificial neural networks;Three-dimensional displays","dexterous manipulators;feature extraction;human-robot interaction;image sensors;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neural nets;robot vision","dexterous robotic hand;robotic grasping;three-dimensional model;robot learning from demonstration;LfD;grasping task automation;human-supplied bounding box;robot visual processing;computer vision processing;man-machine interface;vision-based feature-extraction approach;NEAT neuroevolution algorithm;depth sensor;Kinect;neural networks;machine learning;physical robot;Dreamer;Meka Robotics company","","12","","27","","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes the characteristics of the Essence specification with respect to its suitability for use in academic SE education where students get introduced to the world of SE methods and software processes. To enable a deep understanding of the Essence concepts in an academic setting a suitable approach is needed. The integrated approach presented in this paper introduces students stepwise into the concepts of Essence. It lets them explore the concepts in a virtual simulated game environment and finally deploy them in real world SE endeavors. Thereby an efficient and engaging learning arrangement supports the active construction of knowledge. It encourages active exploration, enables the viewing of the learning object from different perspectives and promotes articulation and reflection in social interchange early in the learning process. Key objectives of this approach are to sensitize students for the diversity of dimensions that have to be taken into account in a SE endeavor, to provide a valuable guidance for using SE methods inside and outside of their curriculum and to enable students to transfer their newly acquired knowledge to other contexts.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-1908-6","10.1109/EDUCON.2015.7096086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096086","software engineering;software engineering education;software engineering practices;software engineering methods;software process;game-based learning;digital gamebased learning;simulation;software process simulation;SEMAT;Essence","Kernel;Software engineering;Context;Software systems;Engineering education;Conferences","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;formal specification","software engineering;integrated game-based approach;SEMAT Essence specification;software processes;SE methods;academic SE education;virtual simulated game environment;social interchange;learning process","","8","","22","","30 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The large data has been pre-processed by octree method. An improved raycasting algorithm is used in association with a transfer function classification method for the effective rendering. The temporal data is used for defining gestures, retrieving in a pattern from the wearable device for providing multimodality with the large rendered data. A gesture vocabulary has been defined by these patterns for the navigation in visualizing the large scale medical data, which consists of five complex interactive postures used for Normal, Picking, Rotation, Dragging, and Zooming gestures. These gesture vocabularies have been categorized by kNN classification method of pattern recognition. Experimental results of the proposed approach are analyzed with the help of various ANOVA and T-testing graphs using SPSS 20 version tool and confidence interval of interaction with hand gestures vocabulary.

Moreover, it is difficult and stressful for the disabled to drive agricultural machinery. Besides, current artificial intelligence technology could not fully realize tractor autonomous driving because of a high uncertain filed environment and short interruptions of satellite navigation signal shaded by trees. To reduce manual operations, a tractor assistant driving control method was proposed based on the human-machine interface utilizing the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. First, the EEG signals of the tractor drivers were collected by a low-cost brain-computer interface (BCI), followed by denoising using a wavelet packet. Then the spectral features of EEG signals were calculated and extracted as the input of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Finally, the EEG-aided RNN driving model was trained for tractor driving robot control such as straight going, brake, left turn, and right turn operations, which control accuracy was 94.5% and time cost was 0.61 ms. Also, 8 electrodes were selected by the PCA algorithm for the design of a portable EEG controller. And the control accuracy reached 93.1% with the time cost of 0.48 ms. To solve the incomplete driving data set in the actual world because some driving manners may cause dangerous or even death, RNN-TL algorithm was employed by creating the complete driving data in the virtual environment followed by transferring the driving control experience to the actual world with small actual driving data set in the field, which control accuracy was 93.5% and time consumption was 0.48 ms. The experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed tractor driving control method based on EEG signal combined with RNN-TL deep learning algorithm which can work with the displacement error less than 6.7 mm when the tractor speed is less than 50 km/h.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021051","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Three New Agricultural Project in Jiangsu Province; Asia Hub NAU-MSU Joint Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9186275","Electroencephalographic (EEG);brain-computer interface (BCI);recurrent neural network (RNN);assistant driving;driving robot","Agricultural machinery;Electroencephalography;Wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Brain-computer interfaces;Manipulators","agricultural machinery;brain-computer interfaces;control engineering computing;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;principal component analysis;recurrent neural nets;signal processing;virtual reality","EEG-aided RNN driving model;recurrent neural network;virtual environment;tractor speed;tractor driving control method;driving control experience;RNN-TL algorithm;driving manners;driving data;portable EEG controller;PCA algorithm;robot control;RNN driving model;low-cost brain-computer interface;tractor drivers;EEG signal;electroencephalographic signal;human-machine interface;satellite navigation signal;tractor autonomous driving;artificial intelligence technology;agricultural machinery;high-intensity work;RNN-TL deep learning algorithm;tractor assistant driving control method","","","","41","CCBY","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the learning phase, data for motion such as waving of the hands, standing on a leg, performing sit-ups and squats is captured from a human strapped with the orient motion capture specks. Key features are extracted from the captured motion data using unsupervised learning algorithms. During subsequent interactions with the robot, the motion of the operator, speckled with orients, is classified and the robot selects to play the closest motion. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the robot operates a well defined vocabulary of motion, and the advantages are the real-time interaction and the rapidity (in a matter of minutes) in programming new behaviour compared to a heuristics-based approach. This paper compares the performances of three unsupervised learning algorithms: c-means, k-means and expectation maximisation (EM) for the four motion scenarios. Nine best candidates for the three learning algorithms for each of the four motion scenarios were selected in the Webots robot simulator and then transferred to the real robot. Metrics were defined for each motion scenario and their performances compared for the three learning algorithms. In all the cases the motions were able to be imitated; c-means was the best, followed closely by the k-means algorithms, and the reasons have been analysed.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-5081-7","10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326151","","Wireless sensor networks;Unsupervised learning;Robot sensing systems;Leg;Humans;Feature extraction;Data mining;Vocabulary;Robot programming;Motion analysis","expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;human-robot interaction;learning systems;legged locomotion;manipulators;motion control;pattern classification;pattern clustering;real-time systems;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","bipedal robot;full on-body sensor network;wireless sensor network;real-time human-robot interaction;orient motion capture specknet;learning phase algorithm;feature extraction;unsupervised learning algorithm;pattern classification;motion vocabulary;heuristics-based approach;fuzzy c-means algorithm;k-means algorithm;expectation maximisation;Webots robot simulator;robot hands;robot arm waving;motionviewer software","","2","","16","","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To support such multimedia learning objects, its multimedia data service system should have a capacity to serve the growing number of clients and new data. A streaming server transfers multimedia files to clients from a repository of files in real time. The server must guarantee concurrent and uninterrupted delivery of each video stream requested by clients. To provide efficient services, many stream servers adopt multi-processors, sufficient memory, and RAID or SAN in their systems. In this paper, we propose a Linux-based parallel media streaming server. This system uses a unique striping policy to distribute multimedia files into the parallel storage nodes. If a service request occurs, each storage node transmits striped files concurrently to the client. Its performance is better than the existing single media streaming service.","","0-7695-1509-6","10.1109/CIE.2002.1185884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185884","","Streaming media;Network servers;Content management;Education;Multimedia systems;Educational technology;Video sharing;Videoconference;Computer displays;User interfaces","virtual reality;computer aided instruction;parallel processing;client-server systems;multimedia servers;multimedia systems","parallel media stream server;virtual class delivery;redundant arrays of inexpensive disks;multimedia learning objects;multimedia data service system;multimedia files transfer;client server system;concurrent delivery;uninterrupted delivery;video stream delivery;Linux-based parallel media streaming server;striping policy;multimedia files distribution;parallel storage nodes;service request","","1","","4","","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fundamental objective of assessment approaches should help promote learner engagement and is appropriate to the diversity of learners that may be present in any class. Learning from online or virtual classrooms can be more challenging due to lack of direct personal engagement between the teacher and the student. There are various modes of assessment commonly adopted today and students may exhibit different levels of performance based on the assessment method. This paper focuses on cross-comparison of these techniques to learning of laboratory concepts in a virtual environment. Apart from comparison of the commonly used assessment methods such as multiple choice questions, descriptive questions, true/false statements etc., the work explores the best methodology to correlate assessment from a reliability and validity perspective to the learning objectives and measure the progress of individual students. Correlating the innate learning styles of students to assessment approaches is another outcome of this work. In addition, the use of concept maps to assess the relationship between various science based principles is characterized for two different experimental labs with N=147 students. The advantages to using assessment techniques from a `time-to-assess' is also elaborated in this work.","","978-1-4799-8792-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275723","Virtual Laboratories;Conceptual Learning;Concept Maps;Assessments;Educational Technologies","Compounds;Heating;Reliability;Mathematical model;Visualization;Heat transfer","computer aided instruction;teaching","concept mapping;virtual laboratory experimental knowledge assessment;quantitative assessment;learning;teaching practices;learner engagement;online classroom;virtual classroom;virtual environment;science based principles;assessment techniques;time-to-assess","","","","28","","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

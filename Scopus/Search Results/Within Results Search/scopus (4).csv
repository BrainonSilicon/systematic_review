Proficiency-based training (PBT) in laparoscopy has shown promising results on skills transfer. However, time constraints and limited possibilities for distributed training constitute barriers to effective PBT. Home-based training may provide a solution to these barriers and may be a feasible alternative to centralized training in times of assembly constraints. Methods: We randomly assigned first-year trainees in abdominal surgery, gynecology, and urology to either centralized instructor-regulated training (CIRT) or home-based self-regulated training (HSRT) in laparoscopy. All participants trained on portable box trainers providing feedback on metrics and possibility for video reviewing. Training in both groups was structured as PBT with graded proficiency exercises adopted from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS). The HSRT group trained at home guided by online learning materials, while the CIRT group attended two training sessions in the simulation center with feedback from experienced instructors. Performance tests consisted of hand–eye and bimanual coordination, suture and knot-tying, and FLS exercises. We analyzed passing rates, training time and distribution, and test performances. Results: Passing rates were 87% and 96% in the CIRT and HSRT group, respectively. HSRT facilitated distributed training and resulted in greater variation in training times. Task times for hand–eye and bimanual coordination were significantly reduced between pretest and posttest in both groups. Trainees maintained their posttest performances at the 6-month retention test. Our analyses revealed no significant inter-group differences in performances at pretest, posttest, or retention test. Performance improvements in the two groups followed similar patterns. Conclusion: CIRT and HSRT in laparoscopy result in comparable performance improvements. HSRT in laparoscopy is a feasible and effective alternative to CIRT when offered inside a supportive instructional design. Further research is needed to clarify trainees’ preferences and explore facilitators and barriers to HSRT. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Laparoscopy; Proficiency-based training; Remote learning; Self-regulated learning; Simulation; Surgery",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103224097

Summary Background Data: There is currently no validated, uniformly accepted curriculum for training in robotic surgery skills. Methods: Single-blinded parallel-group randomized trial at 12 international American College of Surgeons (ACS) Accredited Education Institutes (AEI). Thirty-three robotic surgery experts and 123 inexperienced surgical trainees were enrolled between April 2015 and November 2016. Benchmarks (proficiency levels) on the 7 FRS Dome tasks were established based on expert performance. Participants were then randomly assigned to 4 training groups: Dome (n ¼ 29), dV-Trainer (n ¼ 30), and DVSS (n ¼ 32) that trained to benchmarks and control (n ¼ 32) that trained using locally available robotic skills curricula. The primary outcome was participant performance after training based on task errors and duration on 5 basic robotic tasks (knot tying, continuous suturing, cutting, dissection, and vessel coagulation) using an avian tissue model (transfer-test). Secondary outcomes included cognitive test scores, GEARS ratings, and robot familiarity checklist scores. Results: All groups demonstrated significant performance improvement after skills training (P < 0.01). Participating residents and fellows performed tasks faster (DOME and DVSS groups) and with fewer errors than controls (DOME group; P < 0.01). Inter-rater reliability was high for the checklist scores (0.82-0.97) but moderate for GEARS ratings (0.40-0.67). Conclusions: We provide evidence of effectiveness for the FRS curriculum by demonstrating better performance of those trained following FRS compared with controls on a transfer test. We therefore argue for its implementation across training programs before surgeons apply these skills clinically. Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We investigate a general purpose non-linear transfer function that keeps the user's reach within reasonable bounds to maintain body ownership. The technique amplifies smaller movements from a user-definable neutral point into the expected larger movements using a configurable Hermite curve. Two experiments evaluate the approach. The first establishes that the technique has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, increasing physical comfort while maintaining task performance and body ownership.

Soft tissue temperature must be obtained from the deformed tissue for precise delivery of thermal energy. However, the classical Pennes bio-heat transfer model can handle only the static non-moving state of tissue. In addition, in order to enable a surgeon to visualise the simulated results immediately, the solution procedure must be suitable for real-time thermal applications. Methods: This paper presents a formulation of bio-heat transfer under the effect of soft tissue deformation for fast or near real-time tissue temperature prediction, based on fast explicit dynamics finite element algorithm (FED-FEM) for transient heat transfer. The proposed thermal analysis under deformation is achieved by transformation of the unknown deformed tissue state to the known initial static state via a mapping function. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed formulation are evaluated on a realistic virtual human liver model with blood vessels to demonstrate a clinically relevant scenario of thermal ablation of hepatic cancer. Results: For numerical accuracy, the proposed formulation can achieve a typical 10−3 level of normalised relative error at nodes and between 10−4 and 10−5 level of total errors for the simulation, by comparing solutions against the commercial finite element analysis package. For computation time, the proposed formulation under tissue deformation with anisotropic temperature-dependent properties consumes 2.518 × 10−4 ms for one element thermal loads computation, compared to 2.237 × 10−4 ms for the formulation without deformation which is 0.89 times of the former. Comparisons with three other formulations for isotropic and temperature-independent properties are also presented. Conclusions: Compared to conventional methods focusing on numerical accuracy, convergence and stability, the proposed formulation focuses on computational performance for fast tissue thermal analysis. Compared to the classical Pennes model that handles only the static state of tissue, the proposed formulation can achieve fast thermal analysis on deformed states of tissue and can be applied in addition to tissue deformable models for non-linear heating analysis at even large deformation of soft tissue, leading to great translational potential in dynamic tissue temperature analysis and thermal dosimetry computation for computer-integrated medical education and personalised treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-heat transfer; Explicit dynamics finite element; Non-linear computational analysis; Soft tissue deformation; Surgical simulation","Blood vessels; Computational efficiency; Convergence of numerical methods; Deformation; Dynamics; Electrotherapeutics; Finite element method; Heat transfer; Hyperthermia therapy; Medical education; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Virtual reality; Bio-heat transfer; Computational analysis; Explicit dynamics; Soft tissue deformation; Surgical simulation; Tissue; Article; blood vessel; clinical effectiveness; fast explicit dynamics finite element algorithm; finite element analysis; heat transfer; liver cancer; mathematical computing; predictive value; program appropriateness; quantitative study; simulation training; soft tissue; surgeon; surgical training; temperature measurement; thermal analysis; thermotherapy; ablation therapy; algorithm; anatomic model; biological model; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; electrosurgery; finite element analysis; heat; human; liver; liver tumor; statistical model; three-dimensional imaging; vascularization; Ablation Techniques; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Electrosurgery; Finite Element Analysis; Hot Temperature; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Linear Models; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Models, Anatomic; Models, Cardiovascular",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075762698

Our aim was to determine how self-reported and objectively measured fatigue of upper limb differ between laparoscopic and robotic surgical training environments. Methods. Surgeons at the 2016 SAGES Conference Learning Center and at our institution were enrolled. Two standardized surgical tasks (peg transfer [PT] and needle passing [NP]) were performed twice in each surgical skills practical environments: (1) laparoscopic training-box environment (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery [FLS]) and (2) Mimic dV-trainer (MIMIC). Muscle activation of upper trapezius (UT), anterior deltoid (AD), flexor carpi radialis, and extensor digitorum were recorded using surface electromyography (EMG; Trigno, Delsys, Inc, Natick, MA). Subjective fatigue was self-reported using Piper Fatigue Scale-12. Analysis was done using SPSS v25.0, α =.05. Results. Demographics were similar between FLS (N = 14) and MIMIC (N = 12). For PT, MIMIC had a significant increase in EMGRMS of UT (P &lt;.001) and AD (P &lt;.001). Conversely, FLS led to significant decreased muscle fatigue in UT (P =.015). For NP, MIMIC had a significant increase in EMGRMS for UT (P =.034) and AD (P =.031), but FLS induced more muscle fatigue for AD (P =.004). There was significant decrease in self-reported fatigue after performing FLS tasks (P =.030) but not after MIMIC (P =.663). Conclusion. Our results showed that practice with MIMIC resulted in greater activation of shoulder muscles, while FLS caused more significant muscle fatigue in the same muscles. This could be due to ergonomic disadvantages and nonoptimal ergonomic settings. Further studies are needed to understand the optimal ergonomics and its impact on fatigue and muscle activation during use of both the FLS and MIMIC training systems. © The Author(s) 2019.","ergonomics; human factors study; simulation; surgical education","adult; Article; disease assessment; electromyography; ergonomics; extensor digitorum longus muscle; female; flexor carpi radialis muscle; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale; health survey; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; minimally invasive surgery; muscle fatigue; needle passing; outcome assessment; peg transfer; piper fatigue scale 12; procedures; questionnaire; robotic surgical procedure; self report; skill; surgeon; surgical technique; training; trapezius muscle; upper limb; clinical competence; education; ergonomics; laparoscopy; muscle fatigue; physiology; procedures; robot assisted surgery; skeletal muscle; surgeon; Adult; Clinical Competence; Electromyography; Ergonomics; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle, Skeletal; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgeons; Upper Extremity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076003369

Several factors influence not only the reliability of judgments but also the number of observations needed for making judgments of competency that are both consistent and reproducible. The aim of this study was to explore the role of various conditions-through the analysis of data from large-scale, simulation-based assessments of surgical technical skills-by examining the effects of those conditions on reliability using generalizability theory. Method Assessment data from large-scale, simulation-based temporal bone surgical training research studies in 2012-2018 were pooled, yielding collectively 3,574 assessments of 1,723 performances. The authors conducted generalizability analyses using an unbalanced random-effects design, and they performed decision studies to explore the effect of the different variables on projections of reliability. Results Overall, 5 observations were needed to achieve a generalizability coefficient > 0.8. Several variables modified the projections of reliability: Increased learner experience necessitated more observations (5 for medical students, 7 for residents, and 8 for experienced surgeons), the more complex cadaveric dissection required fewer observations than virtual reality simulation (2 vs 5 observations), and increased fidelity simulation graphics reduced the number of observations needed from 7 to 4. The training structure (either massed or distributed practice) and simulator-integrated tutoring had little effect on reliability. Finally, more observations were needed during initial training when the learning curve was steepest (6 observations) compared with the plateau phase (4 observations). Conclusions Reliability in surgical skills assessment seems less stable than it is often reported to be. Training context and conditions influence reliability. The findings from this study highlight that medical educators should exercise caution when using a specific simulation-based assessment in other contexts. © 2020 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",,"clinical competence; education; human; learning curve; orthopedic surgery; reproducibility; simulation training; surgery; temporal bone; Clinical Competence; Humans; Learning Curve; Orthopedic Procedures; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; Temporal Bone",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096886868

We aim to identify the currently available simulators and training courses for neurosurgery, assess their validity, and determine their effectiveness. Methods: Both MEDLINE and Embase were searched for English language articles which validate simulation models for neurosurgery. Each study was screened according to the Messick validity framework and rated in each domain. The McGaghie model of translational outcomes was then used to determine a level of effectiveness (LoE) for each simulator or training course. Results: On screening of 6006 articles, 114 were identified to either validate or determine an LoE for 108 simulation-based training models or courses. Achieving the highest rating for each validity domain were 6 models and training courses for content validity, 12 for response processes, 4 for internal structure, 14 for relations to other variables, and none for consequences. For translational outcomes, 6 simulators or training achieved an LoE >2 and thus showed skills transfer beyond the simulation setting. Conclusions: With the advent of increasing neurosurgery simulators and training tools, there is a need for more validity studies. Further attempts to investigate translational outcomes to the operating theater when using these simulators is particularly warranted. More training tools incorporating full-immersion simulation and nontechnical skills training are recommended. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Education; Neurosurgery; Simulation; Training","Article; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; endoscopic endonasal surgery; human; neurosurgery; simulation training; surgical training; systematic review; transsphenoidal surgery; ventriculostomy; brain; clinical competence; education; neurosurgery; procedures; simulation training; skull; surgery; Brain; Clinical Competence; Humans; Neurosurgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Skull",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073812751

Methods: Both Medline and Embase were searched for English language articles that validate simulation models for neurosurgery. Each study was screened according to the Messick validity framework, and rated in each domain. The McGaghie model of translational outcomes was then used to determine a level of effectiveness for each simulator or training course. Results: Overall, 114 articles for 108 simulation-based training models or courses were identified. These articles included 24 for spine simulators, 3 for nontechnical skills, 10 for 9 pediatric neurosurgery simulators, and 12 for 11 interventional neuroradiology simulators. Achieving the highest rating for each validity domain were 3 models for content validity; 16 for response processes; 1 for internal structure; 2 for relations to other variables; and only 1 for consequences. For translational outcomes, 2 training courses achieved a level of effectiveness of >2, showing skills transfer beyond the simulator environment. Conclusions: With increasing simulators, there is a need for more validity studies and attempts to investigate translational outcomes to the operating theater when using these simulators. Nontechnical skills training is notably lacking, despite demand within the field. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Education; Neurosurgery; Simulation; Training","Article; cadaver; human; neuroradiology; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; pediatric surgery; skill; spine surgery; surgical training; systematic review; child; clinical competence; education; procedures; radiology; simulation training; spinal cord; spine; surgery; Child; Clinical Competence; Humans; Neurosurgical Procedures; Radiology; Simulation Training; Spinal Cord; Spine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073761722

These advancements may increase the understanding, assessment and training of psychomotor performance. Consequently, the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate performance on virtual reality simulators has led to an increase in the volume and complexity of publications which bridge the fields of computer science, medicine, and education. Although all disciplines stand to gain from research in this field, important differences in reporting exist, limiting interdisciplinary communication and knowledge transfer. Thus, our objective was to develop a checklist to provide a general framework when reporting or analyzing studies involving virtual reality surgical simulation and machine learning algorithms. By including a total score as well as clear subsections of the checklist, authors and reviewers can both easily assess the overall quality and specific deficiencies of a manuscript. Design: The Machine Learning to Assess Surgical Expertise (MLASE) checklist was developed to help computer science, medicine, and education researchers ensure quality when producing and reviewing virtual reality manuscripts involving machine learning to assess surgical expertise. Setting: This study was carried out at the McGill Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre. Participants: The authors applied the checklist to 12 articles using machine learning to assess surgical expertise in virtual reality simulation, obtained through a systematic literature review. Results: Important differences in reporting were found between medical and computer science journals. The medical journals proved stronger in discussion quality and weaker in areas related to study design. The opposite trends were observed in computer science journals. Conclusions: This checklist will aid in narrowing the knowledge divide between computer science, medicine, and education: helping facilitate the burgeoning field of machine learning assisted surgical education. © 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","artificial intelligence; assessment; education; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; machine learning; Medical Knowledge; Patient Care; simulation; surgery","Article; artificial intelligence; human; machine learning; medical education; priority journal; surgical training; virtual reality; artificial intelligence; clinical competence; education; general surgery; medical education; practice guideline; procedures; simulation training; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Measurement; General Surgery; Machine Learning; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Simulation Training; Virtual Reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067122816

In manufacturing plants, the ergonomic assessment of adopted working postures is indispensable to avoid risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This process receives high research interest and requires extracting plausible postural information as a preliminary step. This paper presents a semi-automated end-to-end ergonomic assessment system of adopted working postures. The proposed system analyzes the human posture holistically, does not rely on any attached markers, uses low cost depth technologies and leverages the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular, we train a deep convolutional neural network to analyze the articulated posture and predict body joint angles from a single depth image. The proposed method relies on learning from synthetic training images to allow simulating several physical tasks, different body shapes and rendering parameters and obtaining a highly generalizable model. The corresponding ground truth joint angles have been generated using a novel inverse kinematics modeling stage. We validated the proposed system in real environments and achieved a joint angle mean absolute error (MAE)of 3.19±1.57∘ and a rapid upper limb assessment (RULA)grand score prediction accuracy of 89% with Kappa index of 0.71 which means substantial agreement with reference scores.

However, a critical appraisal of the reliability of visual rating scales in neurosurgery is lacking. Therefore, we sought to design a study to compare visual rating scales with simulated metrics in a neurosurgical virtual reality task. Methods: Neurosurgical faculty rated anonymized participant video recordings of the removal of simulated brain tumors using a visual rating scale made up of seven composite elements. Scale reliability was evaluated using generalizability theory, and scale subcomponents were compared with simulated metrics using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Four staff neurosurgeons evaluated 16 medical student neurosurgery applicants. Overall scale reliability and internal consistency were 0.73 and 0.90, respectively. Reliability of 0.71 was achieved with two raters. Individual participants, raters, and scale items accounted for 27%, 11%, and 0.6% of the data variability. The hemostasis scale component related to the greatest number of simulated metrics, whereas respect for no-go zones and tissue was correlated with none. Metrics relating to instrument force and patient safety (brain volume removed and blood loss) were captured by the fewest number of rating scale components. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing participant's ratings with simulated performance. Given rating scales capture less well instrument force, quantity of brain volume removed, and blood loss, we suggest adopting a hybrid educational approach using visual rating scales in an operative environment, supplemented by simulated sessions to uncover potentially problematic surgical technique. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Assessment; Education; Neurosurgery; Resident; Simulation; Surgery","Article; brain tumor; Canadian; comparative study; controlled study; human; internal consistency; medical student; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; rating scale; simulated virtual reality metrics; stereoscopic vision; surgical training; videorecording; virtual reality; visual rating scale; Young modulus; brain tumor; education; medical education; neurosurgery; observer variation; operative blood loss; patient safety; procedures; psychomotor performance; simulation training; theoretical model; Blood Loss, Surgical; Brain Neoplasms; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internship and Residency; Models, Theoretical; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Observer Variation; Patient Safety; Psychomotor Performance; Simulation Training; Students, Medical; Video Recording; Virtual Reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064640164

Methods: A prospective database was maintained for all the participants in urological laparoscopic courses run by a single dedicated unit between January 2016 and December 2016. Data on various variables were collected using a follow-up validated questionnaire exploring speciality of clinical practice, challenges and need for additional training to establish clinical services, improvement in quality and frequency of laparoscopic courses. A subset of participants reported data of their outcomes in a national database available publically. Results: One hundred sixty one delegates were drawn from 18 countries attended laparoscopic skills courses during the study period of 10 years. Data were available for 154 (95.65%) participants. There were only 20 (20/154; 12.9%) responses to online website questionnaires despite 3 reminders. Further, follow-up through websites/telephonic contact/organizational contacts improved the response rate to 93% (143/154). Of the participants, 95% (135/143) felt that these courses should be continued, and they agreed to recommend them to their trainees in the future.

However, intraoperative training is time-intensive and exposes patients to greater risks. Touch Surgery (TS) is an application that uses animation to provide simulation training via cognitive task analysis as an adjunct to intraoperative training. Methods: Forty students were recruited and randomly allocated to either a control or intervention group. Each group received the same preparation before intervention, including a 10-min introduction to laparoscopic equipment and a 15-min educational tutorial on laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants then received training via either TS (intervention) or written information (control). Their performance was compared using a validated scoring tool on a porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomy model. Significance was defined as P < 0.050. Results: In total, n = 22 and n = 18 participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between age (P = 0.320), year of medical school (P = 0.322), handedness (P = 1.000), or gender (P = 0.360) of the groups. The overall mean performance score was higher for intervention (mean ± SD = 41.9 ± 22.5) than control (mean ± SD = 24.7 ± 19.6; P = 0.016). There was no significant difference between scores for each intraoperative segment between the intervention and control group (P > 0.050). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that TS is effective for providing cognitive training in laparoscopic cholecystectomies to medical students. It is likely that this effect will be seen across modules and other platforms that use cognitive task analysis alongside high-fidelity animation.

The interpolation can handle the interpolation and dilation in 3D of points, lines, planes, circles and spheres. With this procedure, we interpolate trajectories of surgical instrument. Using quaternions, we formulate the quaternion spike neural network for control. This new neural network structure is based on Spike Neural Networks and developed using the quaternion algebra. The real valued training algorithm was extended so that it could make adjustments of the weights according to the properties and product of the quaternion algebra. In this spike neural network, we are taking into account two relevant ideas the use of Spike neural network which is the best model for oculo-motor control and the role of geometric computing.

Laboratory practice models using artificial vessels are frequently used for this purpose. However, the efficacy of such practice models has not been objectively assessed for the performance of microvascular anastomosis during live surgical settings. This study was conducted to assess the transfer of learning from practicing microvascular anastomosis on tubes to anastomosing rat abdominal aorta. Methods Ten surgeons without any experience in microvascular anastomosis were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. Both groups received didactic and visual training on end-to-end microvascular anastomosis. The experimental group received 24 sessions of hands-on training on microanastomosis using Silastic tubes. Next, both groups underwent recall tests on weeks 1, 2, and 8 after training. The recall test consisted of completing an end-to-end anastomosis on the rat's abdominal aorta. Anastomosis score, the time to complete the anastomosis, and the average time to place 1 stitch on the vessel perimeter were compared between the 2 groups. Results Compared with the control group, the experimental group did significantly better in terms of anastomosis score, total time, and per-stitch time. The measured variables showed stability and did not change significantly between the 3 recall tests. Conclusion The skill of microvascular anastomosis is transferred from practicing on Silastic tubes to rat's abdominal aorta. Considering the relative advantages of Silastic tubes to live rodent surgeries, such as lower cost and absence of ethical issues, our results support the widespread use of Silastic tubes in training programs for microvascular anastomosis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aorta bypass; Artificial vessel; Bypass surgery; Cerebral revascularization; Microanastomosis; Practice model; Rodent surgery","abdominal aorta; Anastomosis Score Scale; aneurysm clip; animal tissue; Article; assessment of humans; blood vessel shunt; controlled study; end to end anastomosis; experience; experiential learning; forceps; learning curve; male; medical practice; microneedle; microvascular anastomosis; microvascular surgery; neurosurgeon; nonhuman; nylon suture; operation duration; perimeter; pretest posttest control group design; rat; recall; silastic tube; surgical microscope; surgical training; vascular equipment; vascular surgeon; vessel approximator; abdominal aorta; anastomosis; animal; education; human; microsurgery; randomized controlled trial; simulation training; surgery; transfer of learning; vascular surgery; baysilon; dimeticone; Anastomosis, Surgical; Animals; Aorta, Abdominal; Dimethylpolysiloxanes; Humans; Microsurgery; Neurosurgeons; Rats; Simulation Training; Transfer (Psychology); Vascular Surgical Procedures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029819048

Nevertheless, there is currently no objective index capable of assessing the surgeon cognitive cost while performing LESS. We assessed if gaze-based indices might offer unique and unbiased measures to quantify LESS complexity and its cognitive cost. We expect that the assessment of surgeon's cognitive cost to improve patient safety by measuring fitness-for-duty and reducing surgeons overload. Methods Using a wearable eye tracker device, we measured gaze entropy and velocity of surgical trainees and attending surgeons during two surgical procedures (LESS vs. multiport laparoscopy surgery [MPS]). None of the participants had previous experience with LESS. They performed two exercises with different complexity levels (Low: Pattern Cut vs. High: Peg Transfer). We also collected performance and subjective data. Results LESS caused higher cognitive demand than MPS, as indicated by increased gaze entropy in both surgical trainees and attending surgeons (exploration pattern became more random). Furthermore, gaze velocity was higher (exploration pattern became more rapid) for the LESS procedure independently of the surgeon's expertise. Perceived task complexity and laparoscopic accuracy confirmed gaze-based results. Conclusion Gaze-based indices have great potential as objective and non-intrusive measures to assess surgeons' cognitive cost and fitness-for-duty. Furthermore, gaze-based indices might play a relevant role in defining future guidelines on surgeons' examinations to mark their achievements during the entire training (e.g. analyzing surgical learning curves). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Eye metrics; LESS; Neuroergonomics; Patient safety; Surgical skills assessment","Costs; Endoscopy; Entropy; Laparoscopy; Personnel training; Eye metrics; LESS; Neuroergonomics; Patient safety; Surgical skills assessment; Surgery; achievement; entropy; exercise; gaze; human; laparoscopy; learning curve; patient safety; practice guideline; quantitative study; skill; student; surgeon; surgery; velocity; adult; clinical competence; cognition; education; endoscopy; eye movement; female; general surgery; laparoscopy; male; medical education; medical staff; oculography; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; simulation training; standards; task performance; workload; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Cognition; Endoscopy; Entropy; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Medical Staff, Hospital; Simulation Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; Task Performance and Analysis; Workload; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021325742

Laparoscopic basic skills can be learned in simulators as box- or virtual-reality (VR) trainers. However, there is no clear recommendation for either box or VR trainers as the most appropriate tool for the transfer of acquired laparoscopic basic skills into a surgical procedure. Design Both training tools were compared, using validated and well-established curricula in the acquirement of basic skills, in a prospective randomized trial in a 5-day structured laparoscopic training course. Participants completed either a box- or VR-trainer curriculum and then applied the learned skills performing an ex situ laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a pig liver. The performance was recorded on video and evaluated offline by 4 blinded observers using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score. Learning curves of the various exercises included in the training course were compared and the improvement in each exercise was analyzed. Setting Surgical Skills Lab of the Department of General and Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Muenster. Participants Surgical novices without prior surgical experience (medical students, n = 36). Results Posttraining evaluation showed significant improvement compared with baseline in both groups, indicating acquisition of laparoscopic basic skills. Learning curves showed almost the same progression with no significant differences. In simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy, total GOALS score was significantly higher for the box-trained group than the VR-trained group (box: 15.31 ± 3.61 vs. VR: 12.92 ± 3.06; p = 0.039; Hedge׳s g* = 0.699), indicating higher technical skill levels. Conclusions Despite both systems having advantages and disadvantages, they can both be used for simulation training for laparoscopic skills. In the setting with 2 structured, validated and almost identical curricula, the box-trained group appears to be superior in the better transfer of basic skills into an experimental but structured surgical procedure. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","computer simulation; education; GOALS; laparoscopy; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; prospective studies; simulation training; Systems-Based Practice","adult; Article; box reality; depth perception; female; human; human experiment; internal consistency; interrater reliability; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; learning curve; male; priority journal; professional competence; randomized controlled trial; self evaluation; simulation training; surgical training; virtual reality; animal; animal model; clinical competence; controlled study; education; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; liver; medical education; pig; procedures; prospective study; questionnaire; simulation training; surgery; Adult; Animals; Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Learning Curve; Liver; Male; Models, Animal; Prospective Studies; Simulation Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009826742

The aim of this study is to review the literature for different types of simulators described for PCA. Methods: Databases of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, OvidSP, and Google Scholar were systematically searched until May 2016. The studies were analyzed regarding the type of simulator (nonbiologic, biologic, live animal, and virtual reality [VR]), type of validity (face, content, construct, and predictive), cost-effectiveness, and whether these simulators have been used for training and/or assessment of PCA. In addition, the study looked at the educational impact of these simulators in terms of the transfer of PCA skills to the operating room. Results: Several bench, animal, and VR simulators for training in PCA were identified. Only few studies were found on assessment of PCA skills. Biological bench models used porcine or bovine kidneys wrapped within foam, silicone, chicken carcass, or full-thickness skin flap alone. Other biological models used additional subcutaneous fascia, muscle, or ribs. Nonbiological models used prototypes, including 3D printing. Only one study reported the use of anesthetized live pig for training. The PERC Mentor™ was the only VR simulator, which has been validated for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, none of these studies assessed the educational impact of PCA simulators. Furthermore, most of the studies did not address the validity and the cost of the simulator. Conclusions: While several biological and nonbiological PCA models exist, there is paucity of literature regarding the validity and educational impact of these simulators. The PERC Mentor simulator is the sole validated simulator for training and assessment of PCA skills. However, it is expensive and there is little evidence of its educational impact. Therefore, more research is needed to validate the available simulators and assess their educational impact for urology trainees. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","clinical skills; computer simulation; outcome and process assessment; percutaneous nephrolithotomy","silicone; Article; carcass; clinical competence; construct validity; content validity; cost effectiveness analysis; face validity; fascia; foam; human; kidney; muscle; nonhuman; packaging; percutaneous renal access; performance measurement system; predictive validity; program impact; rib; simulation; simulator; skin flap; surgical technique; surgical training; systematic review; three dimensional printing; virtual reality; animal; biological model; bovine; computer interface; computer simulation; cost benefit analysis; education; percutaneous nephrostomy; pig; simulation training; surgery; urologic surgery; urology; Animals; Cattle; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Kidney; Models, Biological; Nephrostomy, Percutaneous; Simulation Training; Swine; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Urology; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018658134

Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most common bariatric procedure performed. Surgeons must be well trained prior to operating on a patient. Multimodality training is vital for bariatric surgery. E-learning with videos is a standard approach for training. The present study investigates whether scoring the operation videos with performance checklists improves learning effects and transfer to a simulated operation. Methods/design: This is a monocentric, two-arm, randomized controlled trial. The trainees are medical students from the University of Heidelberg in their clinical years with no prior laparoscopic experience. After a laparoscopic basic virtual reality (VR) training, 80 students are randomized into one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio to the checklist group (group A) and control group without a checklist (group B). After all students are given an introduction of the training center, VR trainer and laparoscopic instruments, they start with E-learning while watching explanations and videos of RYGB. Only group A will perform ratings with a modified Bariatric Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (BOSATS) scale checklist for all videos watched. Group B watches the same videos without rating. Both groups will then perform an RYGB in the VR trainer as a primary endpoint and small bowel suturing as an additional test in the box trainer for evaluation. Discussion: This study aims to assess if E-learning and rating bariatric surgical videos with a modified BOSATS checklist will improve the learning curve for medical students in an RYGB VR performance. This study may help in future laparoscopic and bariatric training courses. Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00010493.

The study assesses user acceptance and effectiveness of a surgeon-authored virtual reality (VR) training module authored by surgeons using the Toolkit for Illustration of Procedures in Surgery (TIPS). Methods. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was selected to test the TIPS framework on an unusual and complex procedure. No commercial simulation module exists to teach this procedure. A specialist surgeon authored the module, including force-feedback interactive simulation, and designed a quiz to test knowledge of the key procedural steps. Five practicing surgeons, with 15 to 24 years of experience, peer reviewed and tested the module. In all, 14 residents and 9 fellows trained with the module and answered the quiz, preuse and postuse. Participants received an overview during Surgical Grand Rounds session and a 20-minute one-on-one tutorial followed by 30 minutes of instruction in addition to a forcefeedback interactive simulation session. Additionally, in answering questionnaires, the trainees reflected on their learning experience and their experience with the TIPS framework. Results. Correct quiz response rates on procedural steps improved significantly postuse over preuse. In the questionnaire, 96% of the respondents stated that the TIPS module prepares them well or very well for the adrenalectomy, and 87% indicated that the module successfully teaches the steps of the procedure. All participants indicated that they preferred the module compared to training using purely physical props, one-on-one teaching, medical atlases, and video recordings. Conclusions. Improved quiz scores and endorsement by the participants of the TIPS adrenalectomy module establish the viability of surgeons authoring VR training. © The Author(s) 2016.","Education; Haptic device; Laparoscopic adrenalectomy; Surgical simulation; Training","adrenalectomy; adult; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; questionnaire; resident; simulation; student; surgery; teaching; videorecording; virtual reality; adrenalectomy; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; constructive feedback; curriculum; education; health personnel attitude; laparoscopy; simulation training; Adrenalectomy; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Curriculum; Formative Feedback; Humans; Laparoscopy; Simulation Training; Transfer (Psychology); User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029754497

Literature shows that the young novice drivers are not careless drivers but they are clueless drivers' - clueless because of their inability to predict the risk ahead of time that might materialize on the forward roadway. Other error-feedback training programs exist that emphasize the teaching of risk awareness and perception skills to young drivers. In the current study, a Virtual reality based risk awareness and perception training program (V-RAPT) was developed on the Oculus Rift and evaluated on a driving simulator. The training program provides 360 degrees' views of 6 high risk driving scenarios towards training the young driver to anticipate and mitigate latent hazards. Twenty-four participants in three experiment groups were trained on one of 3 training programs-VRAPT, RAPT and Control, and were evaluated on a driving simulator. Eye movements were collected throughout the experiment. The simulator evaluation drives included six near-transfer scenarios used in the training and four far-transfer scenarios not used in the training but validated previously in other similar studies. The young drivers trained on the V-RAPT were found to anticipate a significantly greater proportion (86.25%) of the potential latent hazards as compared to the RAPT trained young drivers (62.36%) and control trained drivers (30.97%). The VR-based training program is shown to be effective in improving young drivers' ability to anticipate latent threats.

This behavior transfers into social interactions in virtual environments. These systems are becoming an increasingly common platform for training, so it is critical to understand how biases will impact them. The present study investigates the effect of the ethnicity bias on error behaviors within a virtual world for medical triage training. Two between subjects variables, participant skin tone (light, dark) and avatar skin tone (light, dark), and one within subjects variable, agent/patient skin tone (light, dark), were manipulated to create a 2 × 2 × 2 mixed design with four conditions. Effects on errors were observed on errors made while helping patient (agents). Participants made considerably more errors while triaging dark-skinned agents which increased the amount of time spent on them, in comparison to light-skinned agents. Within a virtual world for training, people apply general ethnic biases against dark-skinned individuals, which is important to consider when designing such systems because the biases could impact the effectiveness of the training.

They can provide basic skills training in a controlled environment and free of risks for patients. They can also offer objective performance assessment without the need for proctors. However, designing effective user interfaces that allow the acquisition of the appropriate technical skills on these systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to examine a process for achieving interface and environment fidelity during the development of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST). Two iterations of the design process were conducted and evaluated. For that purpose, a total of 42 subjects participated in two experimental studies in which two versions of the VBLaST were compared to the accepted standard in the surgical community for training and assessing basic laparoscopic skills in North America, the FLS box-trainer. Participants performed 10 trials of the peg transfer task on each trainer. The assessment of task performance was based on the validated FLS scoring method. Moreover, a subjective evaluation questionnaire was used to assess the fidelity aspects of the VBLaST relative to the FLS trainer. Finally, a focus group session with expert surgeons was conducted as a comparative situated evaluation after the first design iteration. This session aimed to assess the fidelity aspects of the early VBLaST prototype as compared to the FLS trainer. The results indicate that user performance on the earlier version of the VBLaST resulting from the first design iteration was significantly lower than the performance on the standard FLS box-trainer. The comparative situated evaluation with domain experts permitted us to identify some issues related to the visual, haptic and interface fidelity on this early prototype. Results of the second experiment indicate that the performance on the second generation VBLaST was significantly improved as compared to the first generation and not significantly different from that of the standard FLS box-trainer. Furthermore, the subjects rated the fidelity features of the modified VBLaST version higher than the early version. These findings demonstrate the value of the comparative situated evaluation sessions entailing hands on reflection by domain experts to achieve the environment and interface fidelity and training objectives when designing a virtual reality laparoscopic trainer. This suggests that this method could be used successfully in the future to enhance the value of VR systems as an alternative to physical trainers for laparoscopic surgery skills. Some recommendations on how to use this method to achieve the environment and interface fidelity of a VR laparoscopic surgical trainer are identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Interaction design; Iterative design; Simulator fidelity; surgical training; Virtual reality (VR)","Design; Haptic interfaces; Iterative methods; Laparoscopy; Surgery; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Controlled environment; Interaction design; Iterative design; Performance assessment; Simulator fidelity; Subjective evaluations; Surgical training; Virtual reality trainer; Surgical equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979747876

Augmented reality applications (ARAs) render an interactive virtual layer on top of reality. The use of ARAs is of real interest to medical education because they blend digital elements with the physical learning environment. This will result in new educational opportunities. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate to which extent augmented reality applications are currently used to validly support medical professionals training. Methods: PubMed, Embase, INSPEC and PsychInfo were searched using predefined inclusion criteria for relevant articles up to August 2015. All study types were considered eligible. Articles concerning AR applications used to train or educate medical professionals were evaluated. Results: Twenty-seven studies were found relevant, describing a total of seven augmented reality applications. Applications were assigned to three different categories. The first category is directed toward laparoscopic surgical training, the second category toward mixed reality training of neurosurgical procedures and the third category toward training echocardiography. Statistical pooling of data could not be performed due to heterogeneity of study designs. Face-, construct- and concurrent validity was proven for two applications directed at laparoscopic training, face- and construct validity for neurosurgical procedures and face-, content- and construct validity in echocardiography training. In the literature, none of the ARAs completed a full validation process for the purpose of use. Conclusion: Augmented reality applications that support blended learning in medical training have gained public and scientific interest. In order to be of value, applications must be able to transfer information to the user. Although promising, the literature to date is lacking to support such evidence. © 2016, The Author(s).","Augmented reality; Medical education; Medical specialist training; Surgery; Training","Article; augmented reality application; concurrent validity; construct validity; content validity; echocardiography; face validity; human; laparoscopic surgery; medical education; neurosurgery; priority journal; simulation training; simulator; software; surgical training; systematic review; validation process; virtual reality; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; laparoscopy; learning; software; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Laparoscopy; Learning; Neurosurgical Procedures; Software; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959096172

In this study we investigate the application of various feature detector-descriptors and temporal modeling techniques for laparoscopic skills assessment. Methods: Two different setups were designed: static and dynamic video-histogram analysis. Four well-known feature detection-extraction methods were investigated: SIFT, SURF, STAR-BRIEF and STIP-HOG. For the dynamic setup two temporal models were employed (LDS and GMMAR model). Each method was evaluated for its ability to classify experts and novices on peg transfer and knot tying. Results: STIP-HOG yielded the best performance (static: 74–79%; dynamic: 80–89%). Temporal models had equivalent performance. Important differences were found between the two groups with respect to the underlying dynamics of the video-histogram sequences. Conclusions: Temporal modeling of feature histograms extracted from laparoscopic training videos provides information about the skill level and motion pattern of the operator.

Soft tissue dissection, as one of the most frequently performed operations in surgery, is indispensable to an immersive and high-fidelity surgery simulator. Energized dissection tools are much more commonly used than the traditional sharp scalpels for patient safety. Unfortunately, the interaction of such tools with the soft tissues has been largely ignored in the research of surgical simulators. In this paper, we have proposed an energized soft tissue dissection model. We categorize the soft tissues into three types (fascia, membrane, and fat) and simulate their physical property accordingly. The dissection algorithm we propose employs an edge-based structure, which offers an effective mechanism for the generation of incisions dissected with energized tools. The mesh topology will not be changed when it is dissected by an energized tool, rather it is controlled by the heat transfer model. Our dissection method is highly compatible and efficient to the physically based simulation resolved by a pre-factorized linear system. We have proposed an energized soft tissue dissection model.

To explore this issue, a pilot study was used to evaluate how an individual's performance on a task (i.e., the building an electrical circuit), differs depending on the physical fidelity of the learning environment. In addition, this study examined the effects of cognitive ability and goal orientation on task performance. Specifically this study investigated different methods for practicing the building of electrical circuits using a 2D breadboard simulation, a 3D virtual breadboard, and a physical breadboard. The preliminary results of this pilot study found that physical fidelity of learning environment was a significant predictor of construction time and circuit accuracy.

In order to get airborne, the air wing depends upon the skills of a small number of officers responsible for the safe and rapid launch of aircraft from the carrier deck. These officers, known as ""shooters"", receive initial classroom training on the systems they use then receive qualification to be launch officers through on-the-job training. Due to scheduling complexities the training to achieve qualification is disjointed and often requires trainees to go underway with different aircraft carriers to complete their training. The current approach results in burdens on the parent command, host commands, and the trainees. Of greater concern is the lack of consistency in the training of such a high risk activity. This paper describes the results of a job task analysis conducted to provide insights into the skills required to perform the duties of a launch officer. Further, the information from the job task analysis was examined and a representative finite state machine was developed and is presented. Finally, a portable, low-cost virtual environment created based on the work described above is discussed. It is proposed that the current virtual reality system used for this demonstration faithfully recreates the required attributes and scenarios to train launch officer tasks and that the prototype system, with proof of training transfer can reduce the burden on commands, trainees, and perhaps most importantly, provide consistent training.

Piedras St., Fort Bliss, TX  79920, United States","Background Surgical education is evolving as work hour constraints limit the exposure of residents to the operating room. Potential consequences may include erosion of resident education and decreased quality of patient care. Surgical simulation training has become a focus of study in an effort to counter these challenges. Previous studies have validated the use of arthroscopic surgical simulation programs both in vitro and in vivo. However, no study has examined if the gains made by residents after a simulation program are retained after a period away from training. Methods In all, 17 orthopedic surgery residents were randomized into simulation or standard practice groups. All subjects were oriented to the arthroscopic simulator, a 14-point anatomic checklist, and Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET). The experimental group received 1 hour of simulation training whereas the control group had no additional training. All subjects performed a recorded, diagnostic arthroscopy intraoperatively. These videos were scored by 2 blinded, fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons and outcome measures were compared within and between the groups. After 1 year in which neither group had exposure to surgical simulation training, all residents were retested intraoperatively and scored in the exact same fashion. Individual surgical case logs were reviewed and surgical case volume was documented. Results There was no difference between the 2 groups after initial simulation testing and there was no correlation between case volume and initial scores. After training, the simulation group improved as compared with baseline in mean ASSET (p = 0.023) and mean time to completion (p = 0.01). After 1 year, there was no difference between the groups in any outcome measurements. Conclusion Although individual technical skills can be cultivated with surgical simulation training, these advancements can be lost without continued education. It is imperative that residency programs implement a simulation curriculum and continue to train throughout the academic year.","arthroscopy; Key Words simulation; shoulder; surgical training; transfer validity","arthroscope; Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool; Article; assessment of humans; controlled study; education program; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; orthopedic surgeon; outcome assessment; postgraduate education; priority journal; professional competence; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; reliability; shoulder arthroscopy; simulation training; simulator; single blind procedure; statistical significance; surgical training; arthroscopy; clinical competence; curriculum; education; medical education; shoulder; surgery; time factor; Arthroscopy; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Humans; Internship and Residency; Prospective Studies; Shoulder Joint; Simulation Training; Single-Blind Method; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940688705

The purpose of this study was to assess whether skills learned on the ArthroSim virtual-reality arthroscopic knee simulator transferred to greater skill levels in the operating room.Methods: Postgraduate year-3 orthopaedic residents were randomized into simulator-trained and control groups at seven academic institutions. The experimental group trained on the simulator, performing a knee diagnostic arthroscopy procedure to a predetermined proficiency level based on the average proficiency of five community-based orthopaedic surgeons performing the same procedure on the simulator. The residents in the control group continued their institution-specific orthopaedic education and training. Both groups then performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy procedure on a live patient. Video recordings of the arthroscopic surgery were analyzed by five pairs of expert arthroscopic surgeons blinded to the identity of the residents. A proprietary global rating scale and a procedural checklist, which included visualization and probing scales, were used for rating.Conclusions: We have demonstrated transfer validity (transfer of training) that residents trained to proficiency on a high-fidelity realistic virtual-reality arthroscopic knee simulator showed a greater skill level in the operating room compared with the control group.Clinical Relevance: We believe that the results of our study will stimulate residency program directors to incorporate surgical simulation into the core curriculum of their residency programs.Results: Forty-eight (89%) of the fifty-four postgraduate year-3 residents from seven academic institutions completed the study. The simulator-trained group averaged eleven hours of training on the simulator to reach proficiency. The simulator-trained group performed significantly better when rated according to our procedural checklist (p = 0.031), including probing skills (p = 0.016) but not visualization skills (p = 0.34), compared with the control group. The procedural checklist weighted probing skills double the weight of visualization skills. The global rating scale failed to reach significance (p = 0.061) because of one extreme outlier. The duration of the procedure was not significant. This lack of a significant difference seemed to be related to the fact that residents in the control group were less thorough, which shortened their time to completion of the arthroscopic procedure. © 2014 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",,"arthroscopic surgery; arthrosim virtual reality arthroscopic knee simulator; Article; checklist; controlled study; educational model; global rating scale; human; knee arthroscopy; medical expert; orthopedic surgeon; postgraduate student; professional knowledge; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; residency education; resident; simulator; skill; surgical training; videorecording; virtual reality; arthroscopy; clinical competence; computer interface; education; knee; medical education; orthopedic surgery; surgery; Arthroscopy; Clinical Competence; Humans; Internship and Residency; Knee Joint; Orthopedic Procedures; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910652036

It is an essential skill that surgeons should execute with a high level of experience and sensitive force perception. Surgical training simulators, with virtual and haptic feedback functions, can offer a safe, repeatable and cost-effective alternative to traditional surgeries. In this research, we developed a surgical training simulator with virtual and haptic force feedback for maxillofacial surgery, and we validated the effects on the learning of bone-sawing skills through empirical evaluation. Methods: Omega.6 from Force Dimension was employed as the haptic device, and Display300 from SenseGraphices was used as the 3D stereo display. The voxel-based model was constructed using computed tomography (CT) images, and the virtual tools were built through reverse engineering. The multi-point collision detection method was applied for haptic rendering to test the 3D relationship between the virtual tool and the bone voxels. Bone-sawing procedures in maxillofacial surgery were simulated with a virtual environment and real-time haptic feedback. A total of 25 participants (16 novices and 9 experienced surgeons) were included in 2 groups to perform the bone-sawing simulation for assessing the construct validity. Each of the participants completed the same bone-sawing procedure at the predefined maxillary region six times. For each trial, the sawing operative time, the maximal acceleration, and the percentage of the haptic force exceeding the threshold were recorded and analysed to evaluate the validity. After six trials, all of the participants scored the simulator in terms of safe force learning, stable hand control and overall performance to confirm the face validity. Moreover, 10 novices in 2 groups indentified the transfer validity on rapid prototype skull models by comparing the operative time and the maximal acceleration. Results: The analysed results of construct validity showed that the two groups significantly reduced their sawing operative times after six trials. Regarding maximal acceleration, the curve significantly descended and reached a plateau after the fifth repetition (novices) or third repetition (surgeons). Regarding safe haptic force, the novices obviously reduced the percentage of the haptic force exceeding the threshold, with statistical significance after four trials, but the surgeons did not show a significant difference. Moreover, the subjectively scored results demonstrated that the proposed simulator was more helpful for the novices than for the experienced surgeons, with scores of 8.31 and 7.22, respectively, for their overall performance. The experimental results on skill transference showed that the experimental group performed bone-sawing operation in lower maximal acceleration than control group with a significant difference (p<. 0.05). These findings suggested that the simulator training had positive effects on real sawing. Conclusions: The evaluation results proved the construct validity, face validity and the transfer validity of the simulator. These results indicated that this simulator was able to produce the effect of learning bone-sawing skill, and it could provide a training alternative for novices. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Bone sawing; Haptic; Simulator validation; Skill learning; Surgical training simulator","Bone; Computerized tomography; Haptic interfaces; Personnel training; Reverse engineering; Sawing; Simulators; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Tools; Transplantation (surgical); Virtual reality; Bone; Computerized tomography; Cost effectiveness; Display devices; Haptic interfaces; Personnel training; Reverse engineering; Sawing; Simulators; Stereo image processing; Surgery; Three dimensional computer graphics; Transplantation (surgical); Virtual reality; Bone sawing; Haptic; Simulator validation; Skill learning; Surgical training; Surgical equipment; Surgical equipment; adult; article; bone saw; computer assisted tomography; construct validity; female; human; male; maxillofacial surgery; medical education; normal human; operation duration; priority journal; simulator; skill; surgeon; surgical technique; surgical training; tactile feedback; task performance; validation study; Article; bone sawing skill; computer interface; computer simulation; construct validity; controlled study; empirical research; face validity; maxillofacial surgery; oral surgery; three dimensional imaging; transfer validity; validation study; virtual reality; bone; computer graphics; computer program; computer simulation; education; feedback system; learning; middle aged; orthopedics; procedures; reproducibility; surgery; young adult; Adult; Bone and Bones; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Feedback; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedics; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899473640

This prior work allowed us to determine difficulty-matched sets of rotations for a generalized 3D Fitts-like movement task. We consequently are now able to study the interaction of system latency and movement difficulty in a highly generalized way in a virtual telerobotic environment using wide variety of conditions and targets. Our targets are located on a spherical shell near our participants' starting point in a high dynamic fidelity virtual environment. Analysis of participants' ability to make movements to these targets has revealed a purely multiplicative interaction between control latency and task difficulty. Interestingly, we show that this the observed interaction supports work on Fitts' Law by E.R. Hoffmann and that it depends upon accounting for an internal human processing latency of ∼250 ms. Our data suggest that the interaction varies nonlinearly due to task difficulty in a manner consistent with Hoffmann's results. We propose a descriptive equation to reflect the observed interaction that can be seen as a spatiotemporal generalization of Fitts' Law. Our results provide a basis for generalizing latency requirements for reference tasks that may be varied in difficulty in a manner analogous to the Fitts' Index of Difficulty.",,"Alignment; Human engineering; Virtual reality; Fitts' law; High dynamic; Human performance; Misalignment effects; Spherical shell; System latency; Task difficulty; Ergonomics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957636127

The appropriateness of determining external validity measures has been debated, and it is known that external validity is not a necessary component in research if those findings do not need to transfer outside of that context; however, results in the transportation safety community are frequently generalized, if improperly, to a stated risk in public driving situations. Few studies have validated driving behavior between experimental and non-experimental (observed behavior in public) settings. Proposed is an empirical method to establish a baseline of non-experimental driving behaviors to compare with experimental driving behaviors. This method involves video recording public driving behaviors during the same time interval that data collection occurs in the real world (instrumented vehicle) and virtual world (driving simulator). These video recorded non-experimental driving behaviors at locations along an experimental route can then be compared to experimental driving behaviors in instrumented vehicles and driving simulator scenarios (if developed) to establish empirical differences and potentially contribute to measures of external validity. This method introduces collecting non-experimental driving behavior in order to establish methods that will generalize experimental results as they relate to public driving situations.

There are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. The aim of the STIFF-FLOP European project is to develop a soft robotic arm to perform surgical tasks. The flexibility of the robot allows the surgeon to move within organs to reach remote areas inside the body and perform challenging procedures in laparoscopy. This article addresses the problem of designing learning interfaces enabling the transfer of skills from human demonstration. Robot programming by demonstration encompasses a wide range of learning strategies, from simple mimicking of the demonstrator's actions to the higher level imitation of the underlying intent extracted from the demonstrations. By focusing on this last form, we study the problem of extracting an objective function explaining the demonstrations from an over-specified set of candidate reward functions, and using this information for self-refinement of the skill. In contrast to inverse reinforcement learning strategies that attempt to explain the observations with reward functions defined for the entire task (or a set of pre-defined reward profiles active for different parts of the task), the proposed approach is based on context-dependent reward-weighted learning, where the robot can learn the relevance of candidate objective functions with respect to the current phase of the task or encountered situation. The robot then exploits this information for skills refinement in the policy parameters space. The proposed approach is tested in simulation with a cutting task performed by the STIFF-FLOP flexible robot, using kinesthetic demonstrations from a Barrett WAM manipulator. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Inverse reinforcement learning; Learning from demonstration; Robot-assisted surgery; Skills transfer; Soft robotics; Stochastic optimization","Demonstrations; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Robots; Surgery; Inverse reinforcement learning; Learning from demonstration; Robot-assisted surgery; Skills transfer; Soft robotics; Stochastic optimizations; Surgical equipment; article; human; kinematics; laparoscopic surgery; reinforcement; reward; robot assisted surgery; robotics; simulation; skill; surgical equipment; surgical technique; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biomechanics; computer interface; computer simulation; devices; image quality; motor performance; robotic surgical procedure; robotics; task performance; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomechanical Phenomena; Computer Simulation; Humans; Motor Skills; Phantoms, Imaging; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Robotics; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903192398

Background: Studies demonstrating the effectiveness of simulation do not concentrate upon expert multidisciplinary teams. Moreover, their focus is confined to a single clinical setting, thereby not considering the complex interactions across multiple hospital departments. Methods: A total of 288 participants (Attending surgeons, anesthesiologists, physicians, and nurses) completed this largest simulation study to date, set in the UK Defence Medical Services' Hospital Simulator and the conflict zone in Afghanistan. The simulator termed ""Hospital Exercise"" (HOSPEX) is a fully immersive live-in simulation experience that covers the entire environment of a military hospital with all departments. Participants undertook a 3-day training program within HOSPEX before deployment to war zones. Primary outcome measures were assessed with IMPAcT (the Imperial Military Personnel Assessment Tool). IMPAcT measures crisis management, trauma care, hospital environment, operational readiness, and transfer of skills to civilian practice. Reliability, skills learning, and retention in the conflict zone were assessed statistically. Results: Reliability in skills assessment was excellent (Cronbach α: nontechnical skills = 0.87-0.94; environment/patient skills = 0.83-0.95). Pre/post-HOSPEX comparisons revealed significant improvements in decision making (M = 4.98, SD = 1.20 to M = 5.39, SD = 0.91; P = 0.03), situational awareness (M = 5.44, SD = 1.04 to M = 5.74, SD = 0.92; P = 0.01), trauma care (M = 5.53, SD = 1.23 to M = 5.85, SD = 1.09; P = 0.05), and knowledge of hospital environment (M = 5.19, SD = 1.17 to M = 5.42, SD = 0.97; P = 0.04). No skills decayed over time when assessed several months later in the real conflict zone. All skills transferred to civilian clinical practice. Conclusions: This is the first study to describe the value of a full-hospital simulation across the entire patient pathway.

Methods: With institutional review board approval, 20 first- and second-year general surgery residents were randomized to scheduled training sessions in a surgical simulation laboratory or training in the use of a portable, collapsible Train Anywhere Skill Kit (TASKit) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Cincinnati, OH, USA) trainer. Training was geared toward the FLS set for a skill assessment examination at a 6-month interval. Results: The residents who trained with the TASKit performed the peg-transfer, pattern-cut exercise, Endoloop, and intracorporeal knot-tying FLS tasks statistically more efficiently during their 6-month assessment versus their initial evaluation as compared with the group randomized to the simulation laboratory training. Conclusions: Using a simple collapsible mobile box trainer such as the TASKit can be a cost-effective method of training and preparing residents for FLS tasks considering the current cost associated with virtual and high-definition surgical trainers. This mode of surgical training allows residents to practice in their own time by removing barriers associated with simulation centers. © 2013 by JSLS, Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons.","Collapsible laparoscopic box trainer; Laparoscopic; Surgery; Surgical simulation","article; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; general surgery; human; laparoscopy; medical education; methodology; task performance; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Measurement; General Surgery; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883765979

Our methodology, based on a task-centered design approach, aims to bring out new design rules for virtual learning environments.

The results show that to transfer the skills, the combination of haptic communication with verbal and visual communications improves the novices' performance compared to conventional teaching methods. Furthermore, the results show that, depending on the teaching method, participants developed different needle insertion profiles. We conclude that our interaction paradigm facilitates expert-novice haptic communication and improves skills transfer; and new skills acquisition depends on the availability of different communication channels between experts and novices.

We present a user study comparing two interfaces with different motor activities: the first one, a walking interface (a treadmill with rotation) gives the user a high level of sensorimotor activity (especially body-based and vestibular information). The second one, a brain computer interface (BCI), enables the user to navigate in a virtual environment (VE) without any motor activity, by using brain activity only. The task consisted in learning a path in a virtual city built from a 3D model of a real city with either one of these two interfaces (named treadmill condition and BCI condition), or in the real city directly (the real condition). Then, participants had to recall spatial knowledge, according to six different tasks assessing spatial memory and transfer. We also evaluated the ergonomics of these two interfaces and the presence felt by participants. Surprisingly, contrary to expectations, our results showed similar performances whatever the spatial restitution tasks or the interfaces used, very close to that of the real condition, which tends to indicate that motor activity is not essential to learn and transfer spatial knowledge. Even if BCI seems to be less natural to use than the treadmill, our study suggests that BCI is a promising interface for studying spatial cognition.

An obvious one is augmented visual information early in practice, in particular a direct view of the site instead of the endoscopic view. We studied the effects of such augmented visual information on the simulated ablation of tissue with straight, horizontal and parallel cuts. Direct view had an immediate beneficial effect on performance as compared with endoscopic-view practice. However, in subsequent tests with endoscopic view the benefits disappeared and turned into costs for some aspects of performance, e.g., duration. This finding highlights for a simulated surgical task that optimisation of practice by a performance criterion may not result in optimisation by a transfer criterion.Practitioner Summary: Endoscopic surgery represents a challenge for human sensori-motor skills, but new simulator-based training methods give leeway for optimisation. A candidate is augmented visual feedback, in particular a direct rather than endoscopic view of the site. However, performance becomes dependent on the augmented feedback so that the costs outweigh the benefits. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","augmented feedback; resection; simulation; transfer","Augmented feedback; Beneficial effects; Design option; Endoscopic surgery; Motor learning; Optimisations; Parallel cuts; Performance criterion; resection; simulation; Simulator training; Surgical tasks; Training methods; transfer; Visual feedback; Visual information; Endoscopy; Optimization; Personnel training; Simulators; Surgery; Tissue; Visual communication; Surgical equipment; adaptive behavior; adult; algorithm; analysis of variance; article; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; endoscopy; female; Germany; human; learning; male; methodology; motor performance; task performance; Adult; Algorithms; Analysis of Variance; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Endoscopy; Feedback, Psychological; Female; Germany; Humans; Learning; Male; Motor Skills; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867241236

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic skills training at home using inexpensive trainer boxes. Residents (n = 20, postgraduate years 15) enrolled in an institutional review boardapproved laparoscopic skills training protocol. An instructional video was reviewed, and baseline testing was performed using the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) peg transfer and suturing tasks. Participants were randomized to home training with inexpensive, self-contained trainer boxes or to simulation center training using standard video trainers. Discretionary, goal-directed training of at least 1 hour per week was encouraged. A posttest and retention test were performed. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons as well as the relationship between the suture score and the total training sessions, the time in training, and attempts were studied. Intragroup comparisons showed significant improvement from baseline to the posttest and the retention test. No differences were shown between the groups. The home-trained group practiced more, and the number of sessions correlated with suture retention score (r 2 =.54, P &lt;.039). Home training results in laparoscopic skill acquisition and retention.

This study was designed to present an advanced simulation- training program and to assess the transfer of skills to a live porcine model. Methods: First-year residents were assessed in a 14-session advanced laparoscopic training program followed by performing a jejunojejunostomy in a live porcine model. Previous and after training assessments at the bench model were compared to a single performance of six expert laparoscopic surgeons. Results: obtained by trainees at the porcine model assessment were compared to those of 11 general surgeons without any laparoscopic lab-simulation training and 6 expert laparoscopic surgeons. In all assessments, global and specific OSATS scores, operative time, and covered path length of hands were registered. Results: Twenty-five residents improved significantly their global and specific OSATS score median at the bench model [7 (range, 6-11) vs. 23 (range, 21-24); p < 0.05 and 7 (range, 4-8) vs. 18 (range, 18-19); p < 0.05, respectively] and obtained significantly better scores on the porcine model compared with general surgeons with no lab-simulation training [21 (range, 20.5-21) vs. 8 (range, 12-14); p < 0.05]. The results were comparable to those achieved by expert certificated bariatric surgeons. Total path lengths registered for trainees were more efficient post-training and significantly lower compared with general surgeons on the porcine model [7 (range, 6-11) vs. 23 (range, 21-24); p < 0.05] with no statistical difference compared with experts. Conclusions: Trainees significantly improved their advanced laparoscopic skills to a level compared with expert surgeons. More importantly, these acquired skills were transferred to a more complex live model. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Advanced laparoscopy; Education; Laparoscopic training; Simulation; Surgery; Training/courses","animal experiment; article; controlled study; education program; feasibility study; human; human experiment; jejunostomy; laparoscopic surgery; learning; nonhuman; operation duration; outcome of education; priority journal; resident; simulation; stapler; surgeon; surgical training; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871623969

They have been used to train doctors in many specialties of medicine, allowing tasks to be practised in a safe and repetitive manner. This paper describes a virtual-reality (VR) system which will help to influence surgeons' learning curves in the technically challenging field of laparoscopic surgery of the rectum. Methods: Data from MRI of the rectum and real operation videos are used to construct the virtual models. A haptic force filter based on radial basis functions is designed to offer realistic and smooth force feedback. To handle collision detection efficiently, a hybrid model is presented to compute the deformation of intestines. Finally, a real-time cutting technique based on mesh is employed to represent the incision operation. Results: Despite numerous research efforts, fast and realistic solutions of soft tissues with large deformation, such as intestines, prove extremely challenging. This paper introduces our latest contribution to this endeavour. With this system, the user can haptically operate with the virtual rectum and simultaneously watch the soft tissue deformation. Conclusions: Our system has been tested by colorectal surgeons who believe that the simulated tactile and visual feedbacks are realistic.

Moving or transferring patients is the dominant contributing event. A simulation educational approach has not been closely studied in this area but may have advantages over traditional approaches. Specific aims were to (1) evaluate the effect of a simulation intervention on success of patient transfers in a clinical setting and (2) measure change in participants' knowledge and attitude as a result of the intervention. METHODS: A prospective, observational, longitudinal design was used. Baseline patient transfer observations were conducted on control and intervention units. An optimum task set was developed using hierarchical task analysis methods. Subjects (N = 71) completed pre-and postintervention knowledge and attitude assessments. The intervention consisted of simulated patient transfers using a mannequin, education, and training, followed by repeated simulated transfers using a mannequin with debriefing. Observations of patient transfers in patient care areas were repeated at 4 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Patient transfer success improved from 66% at baseline to 88% at the 4-week measurement point (t = 7.447, P ≤ 0.0004). At 12 weeks, transfer success had decreased to 71%, with addition of new employees between weeks 4 and 12 confounding the 12-week measurement. Knowledge improved from a baseline of 65% to 95% postsimulation intervention (z =-6.634, P ≤ 0.0004). Attitude change was also evaluated with significance seen with 12 of 15 items (P ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A simulation intervention was successful in significantly improving knowledge and changing subject perceptions with regard to this task. Skills acquired through simulation successfully transferred to the clinical setting. Improvement in success for patient moves not trained in the simulation laboratory suggests that acquired skills were generalizable and supports application to different settings.

Participants used a VR simulator that had a physical drill handle interfaced with a haptic force/torque feedback system. They practiced until they met a priori performance criteria and then repeated the procedure with a genuine drill and foam model of a skull. The results showed some positive transfer related to hand steadiness, but not for drilling time. The drilling model incorporated in the simulator may require more effort to maintain the drill position and more revolutions of the drill bit to penetrate the model skull. Thus, practice on the VR simulator enabled the participants to maintain better drill position on the physical model. From a clinical perspective, the findings underscore the advantages of practicing a critical surgical procedure on a simulator prior to performing on a genuine patient.

However, current systems place emphasis on language training, which is only part of the equation in effective communication. Knowledge about culturally dependent social norms directly impacts the interaction outcome. A dynamic, customizable, computationally tractable model for the code of conduct, or etiquette, can alert us of the specific communication protocols of groups of interest, and can prevent over-generalizations which can be detrimental to the end goal. We may not consciously care, or even be aware of etiquette, but it impacts our trust and affect for individuals, and ultimately shapes our subsequent actions. We have adapted a socio-linguistic model of human-human interaction for use in language and culture training. This computational model increases the social intelligence of virtual actors by allowing them to act and react to human students in ways that are more aligned with the humans they simulate.

Research approach - An exploratory study that aims to compare 2 pairs of last year students in co-presence with 1 distant pair. Each pair had to solve an architectural design problem. Collected video has been coded with a systematic method of protocol analysis. Findings/Design - When using an AR desktop-based CAD, distance may not affect the design process itself whereas it may affect how the process is distributed across the various modalities of collaboration. Furthermore, collaborating and architectural experiences influence collaboration and/or design. Research limitations/Implications - Only 3 pairs of students participated in the study resulting in 12 h of video protocol, which limits generalisation of the findings. Originality/Value - The research makes a contribution in providing a detailed view on how external (e.g. situation, technology) and individual factors may affect the activity of collaborative design. Furthermore, we propose a coding method usable beyond design in a wide range of collaborative activities to underline how they are affected by technology and other situational constraints. Take away message - Technology constraints as well as personnal characteristics of designers result in designing with specific forms of multimodal collaboration.","collaborative design; empirical study; multimodal communication; protocol analysis method","Architectural designer; Co-presence; Coding methods; Collaborative activities; Collaborative design; Design process; Empirical studies; Exploratory studies; Generalisation; Individual factors; Multi-modal; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multimodal communications; Protocol analysis; Research approach; Situational constraints; Systematic method; Technology constraints; Architectural design; Augmented reality; Fuzzy control; Research; Virtual reality; Ergonomics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953787655

The aim of this study was to evaluate a simple, low-cost devise for laparoscopic training. In all, 32 participants with varying levels of skill were recruited. A Simulab LapTrainer (Simulab, Seattle, Washington), using a simple plastic box, a webcam, and a Universal Serial Bus 2 card, was used together with standard operating tools. Participants performed 3 tasks (rope passing, peg transfer, and intracorporeal knot tying), which were video recorded and blindly assessed by 2 experts using error scores, checklists, and time. Statistical analysis included nonparametric tests and Cronbach α for inter-rater reliability. A P < .05 was deemed significant. Highly significant differences were noted between groups in all tasks and for all parameters (P = .001). Inter-rater reliability was 0.88. Simulator ratings were good: 63%, excellent: 28%, and only 9% rated it as average. The Simulab LapTrainer provides a valid alternative for skills training.

Background: Surgeons find the endoscopic/laparoscopic surgery procedure to be more mentally stressful than open surgery. This investigation was designed to identify specific stress dimensions associated with these procedures and to determine the contributions to that stress made by loss of depth information resulting from image-guided views of the surgical field and by disruption of eye-hand mapping. Because stress reactions might depend upon familiarity with these procedures, the study focused upon novice participants. Method: An endoscopic box-simulator featured in surgical training was used in conjunction with the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire, a well-validated multidimensional stress state instrument. A control group (no perceptual distortions) viewed the simulated ""surgical field"" directly. Two other groups viewed the surgical field through TV images in which spatial rotation of the images was absent or in which the images were rotated 90° from the actual line of sight. Results: Performance efficiency in the simulator varied inversely with the degree of perceptual-motor distortion. Reactions reflecting increased task coping were observed in all groups. These were accompanied in the image groups by negative reactions involving decreases in hedonic tone and control and confidence and an increase in tense arousal. Conclusions: Perceptual-motor distortions are sources of complex task-induced stress profiles in novices using an endoscopic surgery simulator. Application: Procedures to reduce stress in endoscopic/laparoscopic surgery trainees may benefit from knowledge regarding specific stress dimensions involved.

Technical automatization may be achieved by experienced surgeons such that these distractions have little effect on performance of either the surgical or the cognitive task. This study assessed the effect of adding a distracting cognitive task on performance of a basic laparoscopic skill by novice and experienced surgeons. Methods: In this study, 31 novice (medical students in postgraduate years [PGYs] 1-2) and 9 experienced (fellows/attendants and PGYs 4-5) laparoscopic surgeons practiced the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) laparoscopic peg transfer task until their scores stabilized. The mean normalized score after five repetitions then was recorded. The subjects also were tested on the number of mathematical addition questions they could answer in 1 min. This was repeated five times, with the mean number of questions attempted and the accuracy (% correct) recorded. The laparoscopic and addition tasks then were performed concurrently five times. Data, presented as mean ± standard deviation, were analyzed using Student's t-test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: After practice to stable peg transfer performance, the baseline peg transfer score was higher in the experienced group (98 ± 6 vs 87 ± 12; p < 0.01). There were no baseline differences between the groups in the number of math questions attempted in 1 min (10 ± 2 vs 9 ± 2; p = 0.55) or the number of correct answers (9 ± 3 vs 8 ± 3; p = 0.36). The comparison of baseline performance and dual-task performance showed that the experienced surgeons had no decline in peg transfer score (98 ± 6 vs 97 ± 6; p = 0.48), number of questions attempted in 1 min (10 ± 2 vs 9 ± 3; p = 0.32), or number of correct answers (9 ± 3 vs 8 ± 3; p = 0.46). In contrast, dual-tasking among the novices was associated with a decrease in the number of questions attempted (9 ± 2 vs 8 ± 2; p < 0.01) and the number of correct answers (8 ± 3 vs 7 ± 2; p = 0.02), and with no change in the peg transfer score (87 ± 12 vs 88 ± 8; p = 0.38) compared with baseline. Conclusions: Distraction significantly decreased a novice's ability to process cognitively based math problems, whereas there was no effect on experienced subjects. This occurred despite the fact that the novice group had practiced to high-level peg transfer scores at baseline. This suggests that the experienced surgeons had achieved automatization of the peg transfer basic surgical skill to a level that cognitive distraction did not affect performance of either task. The experienced surgeons were able to attend equally to both tasks, whereas the novices attended to the surgical task at the expense of some aspects of cognitive task performance. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automatization; Cognitive distraction; Dual-tasking; Surgical education; Surgical performance; Surgical simulation","accuracy; article; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; data analysis; experiential learning; female; human; human experiment; job performance; laparoscopic surgery; male; medical practice; medical student; normal human; postgraduate education; priority journal; residency education; statistical significance; surgeon; task performance; Adult; Attention; Clinical Competence; Cognition; Competency-Based Education; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Technology; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Medical Staff, Hospital; Probability; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Surgery; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37749033181

Simulators have been widely suggested to help prepare residents for live clinical experience. We assessed a computer-based colonoscopy simulator for effective transfer of skills to live patients. Methods: A randomized controlled trial included general surgery and internal medicine residents with limited endoscopic experience. Following a pretest, the treatment group (n = 12) practiced on the simulator, while controls (n = 12) received no additional training. Both groups then performed a colonoscopy on a live patient. Technical ability was evaluated by expert endoscopists using previously validated assessment instruments. Results: In the live patient setting, the treatment group scored significantly higher global ratings than controls (t(22) = 1.84, P = .04). Only 2 of the 8 computer-based performance metrics correlated significantly with previously validated global ratings of performance. Conclusions: Residents trained on a colonoscopy simulator prior to their first patient-based colonoscopy performed significantly better in the clinical setting than controls, demonstrating skill transfer to live patients. The simulator's performance metrics showed limited concurrent validity, suggesting the need for further refinement. © 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc.

The ProMIS Augmented Reality (AR) simulator (Haptica, Dublin IR) allows for objective assessment of physical tasks through instrument tracking technology. We hypothesized that the ProMIS metrics could differentiate between ability groups as well as standard FLS scoring with fewer personnel requirements Methods: We recruited 60 volunteer subjects. Subjects were stratified based on their laparoscopic surgical experience. Those who had performed more than 100 laparoscopic procedures were considered experienced (n = 8). Those with fewer than 10 laparoscopic procedures were considered novices (n = 44). The rest were intermediates (n = 8). All subjects performed up to five trials of the peg transfer task from FLS in the ProMIS simulator. The FLS score, instrument path length, and instrument smoothness assessment were generated for each trial. Results: For each of the five trials, experienced surgeons outperformed intermediates, who in turn outperformed novices. Statistically significant differences were seen between the groups across all trials for FLS score (p < 0.001), ProMIS path length (p < 0.001), and ProMIS smoothness (p < 0.001). When the FLS score was compared to the path length and smoothness metrics, a strong relationship between the scores was apparent for novices (r = 0.78, r = 0.94, p < 0.001) respectively), intermediates (r = 0.5, p = 0.2, r = 0.98, p < 0.001), and experienced surgeons (r = 0.86, p = 0.006, r = 0.99, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The construct that the standard scoring of the FLS peg transfer task can discriminate between experienced, intermediate, and novice surgeons is validated. The same construct is valid when the task is assessed using the metrics of the ProMIS. The high correlation between these scores establishes the concurrent validity of the ProMIS metrics. The use of AR for objective assessment of FLS tasks could reduce the personnel requirements of assessing these skills while maintaining the objectivity. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Augmented reality; Laparoscopy; Objective assessment; Simulation","adult; article; concurrent validity; controlled study; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; priority journal; skill; statistical significance; surgeon; surgical technique; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Surgery; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547142654

The first purpose of this study was to assess the differences in motion characteristics between the tip of the instrument and the wrist. The second purpose was to describe the control strategies used to move laparoscopic instruments. During a bead transfer task, motions of a laparoscopic needle driver's tip, heel, and the participants' wrist were monitored. Results showed that large amplitude movements were best described by movements of the wrist, and small amplitude movements were evidenced by motions of the instrument tip. Thus, for describing expertise, and for evaluation and feedback, motion of the tip of the laparoscopic instrument should be quantified, in addition to motion of the wrist. The motions of the instrument were controlled by utilizing the flexibility of the skin of the laparoscopic trainer in addition to using the fulcrum, and sliding through the trocar. In order to increase fidelity, virtual reality trainers should simulate the flexibility of the real structures around the insertion of the instrument. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Numerous influences have led to the development of computer-aided laparoscopic simulators: a need for greater efficiency in training, the unique and complex nature of laparoscopic surgery, and the increasing demand that surgeons demonstrate competence before proceeding to the operating room. The LapMentor™ simulator is expensive, however, and its use must be validated and justified prior to implementation into surgical training programs. METHODS: Nineteen surgical interns were randomized to training on the LapMentor™ laparoscopic simulator (n = 10) or to a control group (no simulator training, n = 9). Subjects randomized to the LapMentor™ trained to expert criterion levels 2 consecutive times on 6 designated basic skills modules. All subjects then completed a series of laparoscopic exercises in a live porcine model, and performance was assessed independently by 2 blinded reviewers. Time, accuracy rates, and global assessments of performance were recorded with an interrater reliability between reviewers of 0.99. RESULTS: LapMentor™ trained interns completed the 30° camera navigation exercise in significantly less time than control interns (166 ± 52 vs. 220 ± 39 seconds, P < 0.05); they also achieved higher accuracy rates in identifying the required objects with the laparoscope (96% ± 8% vs. 82% ± 15%, P < 0.05). Similarly, on the two-handed object transfer exercise, task completion time for LapMentor™ trained versus control interns was 130 ± 23 versus 184 ± 43 seconds (P < 0.01) with an accuracy rate of 98% ± 5% versus 80% ± 13% (P < 0.001). Additionally, LapMentor™ trained interns outperformed control subjects with regard to camera navigation skills, efficiency of motion, optimal instrument handling, perceptual ability, and performance of safe electrocautery. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that prior training on the LapMentor™ laparoscopic simulator leads to improved resident performance of basic skills in the animate operating room environment. This work marks the first prospective, randomized evaluation of the LapMentor™ simulator, and provides evidence that LapMentor™ training may lead to improved operating room performance.

STUDY DESIGN: Surgical residents (PGY1 to PGY5, n = 17) proficient in basic skills, but with minimal laparoscopic suturing experience, were enrolled in an IRB-approved, randomized controlled protocol. Subjects viewed an instructional video and were pretested on a live porcine laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication model by placing three gastrogastric sutures tied in an intracorporeal fashion. A blinded rater objectively scored each knot based on a previously published formula (600 minus completion time [sec] minus penalties for accuracy and knot integrity errors). Subjects were stratified according to pretest scores and randomized. The trained group practiced on a videotrainer suturing model until an expert-derived proficiency score (512) was achieved on 12 attempts. The control group received no training. Both the trained and control groups were posttested on the porcine Nissen model. RESULTS: For the training group, mean time to demonstrate simulator proficiency was 151minutes (range 107 to 224 minutes) and mean number of attempts was 37 (range 24 to 51 attempts). Both the trained and control groups demonstrated significant improvement in overall score from baseline. But the trained group performed significantly better than the control group at posttesting (389 ± 70 versus 217 ± 140, p < 0.001), confirming curriculum effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that training to a predetermined expert level on a videotrainer suture model provides trainees with skills that translate into improved operative performance. Such curricula should be further developed and implemented as a means of ensuring proficiency. © 2005 by the American College of Surgeons.",,"article; curriculum; data analysis; human; laparoscopic surgery; medical practice; operating room; priority journal; residency education; Adult; Animals; Clinical Competence; Competency-Based Education; Computer Simulation; Curriculum; Female; Fundoplication; Goals; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Models, Animal; Single-Blind Method; Surgery; Suture Techniques; Swine; Teaching; Time Factors; Transfer (Psychology); User-Computer Interface; Videotape Recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20544435717

MISTELS has been validated for use in both training and evaluation of general surgery residents in fundamental laparoscopic skills. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the construct validity of MISTELS for urology residents. Subjects and Methods: Seventeen participants were evaluated during performance of the five MISTELS tasks (peg transfer, pattern cutting, ligating loop, and suturing with extracorporeal and intracorporeal knots) using the standardized scoring system, which rewards both speed and precision. Participants included 13 urology residents (PGY 1-5), 1 fellow, and 3 urologists experienced in laparoscopy. Results are expressed as median (range). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare MISTELS scores for 9 novice (PGY 1-4) and 8 experienced urologists (PGY 5-attending). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The median MISTELS total normalized score for novices was 52.3 (range 15-68.9) compared with 71.7 (range 56.3-82.9) for experienced urologists (P = 0.007). Although the experienced group achieved higher scores in all five individual tasks, statistically significant differences were demonstrated for the peg transfer and intracorporeal suture tasks only.

Summary Background Data: For surgical training in laparoscopic surgery, new training methods have to be developed that allow surgeons to first practice in a simulated setting before operating on real patients. A virtual endoscopic surgery trainer (VEST) has been developed within the framework of a joint project. Because of principal limitations of simulation techniques, it is essential to know whether training with this simulator is comparable to conventional training. Methods: Devices used were the VEST system and a conventional video trainer (CVT). Two basic training tasks were constructed identically (a) as virtual tasks and (b) as mechanical models for the CVT. Test persons were divided into 2 groups each consisting of 12 novices and 4 experts. Each group carried out a defined training program over the course of 4 consecutive days on the VEST or the CVT, respectively. To test the transfer of skills, the groups switched devices on the 5th day. The main parameter was task completion time. Results: The novices in both groups showed similar learning curves. The mean task completion times decreased significantly over the 4 training days of the study. The task completion times for the control task on Day 5 were significantly lower than on Days 1 and 2. The experts' task completion times were much lower than those of the novices. Conclusions: This study showed that training with a computer simulator, just as with the CVT, resulted in a reproducible training effect. The control task showed that skills learned in virtual reality are transferable to the physical reality of a CVT. The fact that the experts showed little improvement demonstrates that the simulation trains surgeons in basic laparoscopic skills learned in years of practice.

Summary Background Data: MISTELS is the physical simulator incorporated by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) in their Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program. MISTELS' metrics have been shown to have high interrater and test-retest reliability and to correlate with skill in animal surgery. Methods: Over 200 surgeons and trainees from 5 countries were assessed using MISTELS in a series of experiments to assess the validity of the system and to evaluate whether practicing MISTELS basic skills (transferring) would result in skill acquisition transferable to complex laparoscopic tasks (suturing). Results: Face validity was confirmed through questioning 44 experienced laparoscopic surgeons using global rating scales. MISTELS scores increased progressively with increasing laparoscopic experience (n = 215, P < 0.0001), and residents followed over time improved their scores (n = 24, P < 0.0001), evidence of construct validity. Results in the host institution did not differ from 5 beta sites (n = 215, external validity). MISTELS scores correlated with a highly reliable validated intraoperative rating of technical skill during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 19, r = 0.81, P < 0.0004; concurrent validity). Novice laparoscopists were randomized to practice/no practice of the transfer drill for 4 weeks. Improvement in intracorporeal suturing skill was significantly related to practice but not to baseline ability, career goals, or gender (P < 0.001). Conclusion: MISTELS is a practical and inexpensive inanimate system developed to teach and measure technical skills in laparoscopy. This system is reliable, valid, and a useful educational tool.",,"conference paper; controlled study; education program; human; human experiment; laparoscopic surgery; normal human; priority journal; resident; simulation; skill; surgeon; surgical training; suturing method; task performance; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Continuing; Educational Technology; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Models, Structural; Surgery; Teaching Materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344560212

However, it is still unclear how performance in a specific visual-spatial simulator context may change after training in other simulators with different visual-spatial components. In particular, the aim of this study was to test whether performance in the Procedicus Virtual Arthroscopy (VA) Knee Simulator would remain unchanged after a training session in three other simulators with different visual-spatial components. Methods: Twenty-eight medical students participated in a quasi-transfer study. They were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 14) and a control group (n = 14). Results: Performance in the Procedicus VA Knee Simulator did not improve after training in other simulators with different visual-spatial components (t-test p = NS). No significant correlation was found between the Procedicus VA Knee and the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer (MIST) simulators. Conclusion: One hour of training in different visual-spatial contexts was not enough to improve the performance in virtual arthroscopy tasks. It cannot be excluded, however, that experienced trainees could improve their performance, because perceived similarity between different situations is influenced by many psychological factors.

The study was also designed to determine whether the impact of the visual and auditory cues can be isolated during diagnosis of the hazard. In a study that included 40 participants, results show that trained observers can perceive more correctly a hazardous condition which is different from what one would predict based on psychophysics. The results also show that trained participants relied strongly on the auditory cues to diagnose the potential hazard and risk correctly whereas the untrained participants who had access to both auditory and visual senses perceived the potential hazard more incorrectly than those trained and more similarly to a traditional Stevens' psychophysical curve. Untrained subjects who had only auditory input had the most difficulty in distinguishing differences in the perception of hazard. This is important considering recent dialogue about whether there is a need to train for tasks that will be automated.

Initial stability leading to reduced micromotion and direct apposition of the bone against the implant are mainly responsible for proper load transfer and bone remodeling. The fit and fill of the implant is created by shaping and sizing a cavity within the bone to accommodate the implant, which is usually accomplished by standard machining operations such as broaching, milling and drilling. This paper presents our initial study of developing a bone drilling simulation system, with the goal of guiding a novice surgeon to practice the bone drilling operation. A virtual reality approach is taken to provide force feedback, in order to make the simulation system more intuitive and interactive. Octree is used to organize and manipulate the volumetric data representing the bone model. Adaptive surface rendering is chosen as the graphics display algorithm. Multithreading is used to address the different update rates required in the real-time graphic and haptic displays.","Bone drilling; Bone surgery simulation; Haptics; Octree","Algorithms; Biomechanics; Bone; Broaching; Computer graphics; Computer simulation; Computerized tomography; Drilling; Haptic interfaces; Implants (surgical); Magnetic resonance imaging; Orthopedics; Personnel training; Real time systems; Simulators; Surgery; Bone drilling; Bone surgery simulation; Octree haptics; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842662422

In our earlier SAE papers, we introduced a novel motion simulation approach termed Memory-based Motion Simulation (MBMS). MBMS utilizes existing motion databases and predicts novel motions by modifying existing 'root' motions through the use of the motion modification algorithm. MBMS overcomes some limitations of existing motion simulation models, as 1) it simulates different types of motions on a single, unified framework, 2) it simulates motions based on alternative movement techniques, and 3) like real humans, it can learn new movement skills continually over time. The current study evaluates the prediction accuracy of MBMS to prove its utility as a predictive tool for computer-aided ergonomics. A total of 627 whole-body one-handed load transfer motions predicted by the algorithm are compared with actual human motions obtained in a motion capture experiment. Computed prediction errors were compared to estimates of inherent variability in human motions. The results indicated that the motion modification algorithm can predict 3D whole-body motions accurately with errors that approximate the inherent variability of human motions.

Summary Background Data: The use of VR surgical simulation to train skills and reduce error risk in the OR has never been demonstrated in a prospective, randomized, blinded study. Methods: Sixteen surgical residents (PGY 1-4) had baseline psychomotor abilities assessed, then were randomized to either VR training (MIST VR simulator diathermy task) until expert criterion levels established by experienced laparoscopists were achieved (n = 8), or control non-VR-trained (n = 8). All subjects performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an attending surgeon blinded to training status, Videotapes of gallbladder dissection were reviewed independently by two investigators blinded to subject identity and training, and scored for eight predefined errors for each procedure minute (interrater reliability of error assessment r > 0.80). Results: No differences in baseline assessments were found between groups. Gallbladder dissection was 29% faster for VR-trained residents. Non-VR-trained residents were nine times more likely to transiently fail to make progress (P < .007, Mann-Whitney test) and five times more likely to injure the gallbladder or burn nontarget tissue (chi-square = 4.27, P < .04). Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group (1.19 vs. 7.38 errors per case; P < .008, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusions The use of VR surgical simulation to reach specific target criteria significantly improved the OR performance of residents during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This validation of transfer of training skills from VR to OR sets the stage for more sophisticated uses of VR in assessment, training, error reduction, and certification of surgeons.",,"chi square distribution; cholecystectomy; clinical trial; conference paper; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; human; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopy; operating room; performance; peroperative complication; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rank sum test; reliability; resident; scoring system; simulator; surgeon; surgical injury; surgical training; videotape; virtual reality; Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic; Clinical Competence; Double-Blind Method; Female; Gallbladder Diseases; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Observer Variation; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Surgery; Time Factors; User-Computer Interface",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036785870

In all three experiments the participants had to prevent the hoop from touching the wire as they moved it.

The use of a concept called tactical information deployment provides the surgeon with rapid access to reference information in the operating suite. Multimedia interactive CD-ROMs, with digitized movie clips, illustrations, sound bits, and the latest academic review of the literature arm the surgeon with a database that establishes an unprecedented clinical adaptive capability (CAC). The availability of this information is invaluable to surgeons in their initial advanced laparoscopic procedural efforts. Telementoring simulator opportunities are included to acclimate the participant to the process. If the process seems comprehensive, it is meant to be.

Accordingly, a video game was selected on the basis of its fidelity to the real-world game. It allowed two different methods of adjusting the virtual player's putting force in order to hole a putt: an analogue method that consisted of focusing on the virtual player's movement and a symbolic method that consisted of focusing on the movement of a gauge on a scale representing the virtual player's putting force. The participants had to use one of these methods with either the intention of making progress in actual putting or in a second condition to simply enjoy the game. Results showed a positive transfer of video playing to actual putting skill for the learning group and also, to a lesser degree, for the enjoyment group; but only when they used the symbolic method.

Spine biopsies are often done under computed tomography (CT) guidance and while this technique is effective, it can be time consuming since the biopsy needle must be advanced slowly and its position checked several times to ensure vital organs are not damaged. Quantifying performance during simulation will allow accurate feedback to the surgeon as well as the design engineers. Performance measures are also important to determine transfer of simulator training skills to actual surgical skills. The simulation protocol is in advanced development, and the steps include selecting the best CT slice for viewing the lesion, choosing the skin entry point, and advancing the needle to the biopsy location. Our methods for developing the system include the following: 1) A task analysis, which produces a detailed list of tasks needed to complete a goal, their order, and time to completion, 2) A function allocation assessment, which identifies critical task components with the goal of relieving the human workload by a reallocation of system functions, and 3) A simulator evaluation through subjective ratings and objective human performance measures.","Evaluation; Human-centered design; Spine biopsy; Surgical simulation; Task analysis","Biological organs; Computer simulation; Computerized tomography; Needles; Personnel training; Skin; Surgery; Function allocation; Human-centered design; Simulator evaluation; Spine biopsy simulator; Task analysis; Biopsy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032224296

Beginning with a brief history of simulations and surgery, we present a background to surgery simulators and then discuss the problem of limited human body models in past systems. We present our work at developing human body models beginning with the first virtual reality leg simulator in 1989. This model allowed simple tendon transfers and osteotomies with the computer able to predict the resulting mechanics and ability to walk. We also discuss the leg model's evolution into a performance machine which will allow a surgeon to predict position and subsequent function of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair. This is paralleled by Department of Defense work on a leg model that can have a simulated wound and predicts blood loss and its ability to function. We review computer-aided surgery and virtual reality technologies. We then present our work in plastic surgery computer-aided planning and predict the importance of this work for surgical training.",,"Computer aided instruction; Human form models; Medical applications; Surgery; Plastic surgery computer aided planning; Surgery simulators; Virtual reality leg simulator; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029735497

Results provide no evidence of transfer from a virtual reality training environment to a real-world task. There was no significant difference between the virtual reality training group and the group that received no training on the task. The group that received real-world training performed significantly better than both of the other two groups. The results question the utility of virtual training and suggest that in the present configuration, individuals learn performance characteristics specific only to the virtual reality context. Needed improvements to virtual reality for the purpose of enabling the transfer of training are indicated. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Human factors; Human-computer interaction; Training; Virtual reality","Human engineering; Personnel training; Transfer of training; Virtual reality; Ergonomics; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; data analysis; environment; female; human; information processing; learning; male; normal human; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027626120

However, limitations of current Virtual Reality technologies, e.g., low-fidelity real-time physics simulations and tracking problems, make it difficult to ascertain the full potential of finger-based 3D manipulation techniques. This paper decomposes 3D object manipulation into the component movements, taking into account both physical constraints and mechanics. We fabricate five physical devices that simulate these movements in a measurable way under experimental conditions. We then implement the devices in an immersive environment and conduct an experiment to evaluate direct finger-based against ray-based object manipulation. The key contribution of this work is the careful design and creation of physical and virtual devices to study physics-based 3D object manipulation in a rigorous manner in both real and virtual setups. © 2015 IEEE.",Finger-based manipulation; Immersive Cube-like Displays; Real/virtual world comparison,Virtual reality; 3D object manipulations; Experimental conditions; Finger-based manipulation; Immersive; Immersive environment; Physical constraints; Real/virtual world comparison; Virtual reality technology; User interfaces,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939200619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We explored visuomotor adaptation and spatial generalization of three-dimensional reaching movements performed in a virtual reality environment. We used a multiphase learning paradigm. First, subjects performed reaching movements to six targets without visual feedback (VF) (pre-exposure phase). Next, participants aimed at one target with veridical VF (baseline phase). Immediately after, they were required to adapt their movements to a triaxial visuomotor perturbation (horizontal, vertical, and sagittal translations) between actual hand motion and VF of hand motion in the virtual environment (learning phase). Finally, subjects aimed at the same targets as in the baseline (aftereffect) and pre-exposure phases (generalization) without VF (post-exposure phase). The results revealed spatial axis-dependent visuomotor adaptation capacities. First, subjects showed smaller intertrial variability along the horizontal compared to the sagittal and vertical axes during the baseline and learning phases. Second, although subjects were unaware of the visual distortion, they adapted their movements to each component of the triaxial perturbation. However, they showed reduced learning rate and less persistent adaptation (aftereffect) along the vertical than the horizontal and sagittal axes. Similarly, subjects transferred the newly learned visuomotor association to untrained regions of the workspace, but their average level of generalization was smaller along the vertical than the horizontal and sagittal axes. Collectively, our results suggest that adapting three-dimensional movements to a visual distortion involves distinct processes according to the specific sensorimotor integration demands of moving along each spatial axis. This finding supports the idea that the brain employs a modular decomposition strategy to simplify complex multidimensional visuomotor tasks.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discusses the development and application of a virtual reality (VIR) classroom environment for the neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The head-mounted display VIR system provides a controlled stimulus environment where cognitive challenges can be presented along with the precise delivery and control of distracting auditory and visual stimuli. This level of experimental control allows for the development of attention assessment tasks that are more similar to what is found in the real world and could improve the ecological validity of measurement and treatment in this area. Development of the virtual classroom used a Virtual Research V8 head-mounted display; Ascension Systems head, hand, and leg tracking; and is run on an SGI Onyx platform. Within the classroom, children with ADHD are assessed for reaction time (RT) on immersive visual and 3-dimensional audio attention tasks. Typical classroom distractors are systematically manipulated within the VIR environment, and head turning and general motor movement are also assessed. Methodology for a planned pilot project is described.

Existing approaches have not been able to mimic accurately the complexity of the aircraft maintenance process, reporting limited transfer capabilities and student preparedness for the workplace. This use of virtual reality technology will enable educators to create and students to experience the complex aircraft maintenance environment in an educational classroom, a setting where it has not yet been successfully created using traditional multimedia-based technologies. This model will emphasize the curriculum development and workplace preparedness needed by modern aircraft maintenance technology for local, state and national audiences. The primary objectives of this research are curriculum enhancement and assessment of VR as a pedagogical tool. This innovative approach is the first effort to extend tested VR technology to the aircraft maintenance technology curriculum in a two-year college. The outcome of this research will lead to the following: an innovative, high-impact model for curriculum application in aircraft maintenance technology for college students and industry employees; an increased workplace pool of aircraft maintenance technicians prepared for the transition from learning to workforce; a program providing the use of VR technology as a pedagogical tool. The successful completion of this effort will fill a state and national need for well-prepared students entering the aircraft maintenance industry and will provide a better understanding of the use of VR as a pedagogical tool. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.",,Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering technology; Inspection; Maintenance; Students; Virtual reality; Asynchronous delivery; Curriculum development; Educational classrooms; Transfer capabilities; Aircraft,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029123984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

assembly and maintenance training ,,Transfer of Skills Evaluation for Assembly and Maintenance Training,"One of the research topics within the EU-project SKILLS 1 was the training of Industrial Maintenance and Assembly (IMA) tasks. The IMA demonstrator developed comprehends two different training platforms, one based on technologies of Virtual Reality (VR) and the other one on Augmented Reality (AR). To qualify the efficiency of the developed training systems different studies have been conducted, followed by a final “Transfer of Skill” evaluation that has been performed by service technicians at the “SIDEL industrial training centre” in Parma. This evaluation included qualitative methods (feedback collection in questionnaires) as well as quantitative methods (experiments with control groups). The results demonstrate that both platforms are useful and suitable training tools for IMA tasks, and that the AR training decreased the number of unsolved errors in the task.",1761125939,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Gavish, Nirit;Teresa Gutierrez Seco;Webel, Sabine;Rodriguez, Jorge;Peveri, Matteo;Bockholt, Uli",,," © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2011", 10.1051/bioconf/20110100028, Conference Proceedings, 2011-12-15,2011,2273-1709,, English, English,,, Les Ulis,2011,BIO Web of Conferences,2011,1,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/transfer-skills-evaluation-assembly-maintenance/docview/1761125939/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,, n/a,,," Assembly , Augmented reality , Computer applications , Training , Virtual reality , Platforms , Technicians , Plant maintenance , Control methods , Maintenance training , Training , Evaluation",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=proceeding&amp;atitle=Transfer+of+Skills+Evaluation+for+Assembly+and+Maintenance+Training&amp;author=Gavish%2C+Nirit%3BTeresa+Gutierrez+Seco%3BWebel%2C+Sabine%3BRodriguez%2C+Jorge%3BPeveri%2C+Matteo%3BBockholt%2C+Uli&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=BIO+Web+of+Conferences&amp;issn=2273-1709&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study evaluated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, developed within the scope of the SKILLS Integrated Project, for industrial maintenance and assembly (IMA) tasks training. VR and AR systems are now widely regarded as promising training platforms for complex and highly demanding IMA tasks. However, there is a need to empirically evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional training methods. Forty expert technicians were randomly assigned to four training groups in an electronic actuator assembly task: VR (training with the VR platform twice), Control-VR (watching a filmed demonstration twice), AR (training with the AR platform once), and Control-AR (training with the real actuator and the aid of a filmed demonstration once). A post-training test evaluated performance in the real task. Results demonstrate that, in general, the VR and AR training groups required longer training time compared to the Control-VR and Control-AR groups, respectively. There were fewer unsolved errors in the AR group compared to the Control-AR group, and no significant differences in final performance between the VR and Control-VR groups, probably due to a ceiling effect created by the use of two training trials in the selected task for participants who were expert technicians. The results suggest that use of the AR platform for training IMA tasks should be encouraged and use of the VR platform for that purpose should be further evaluated.

VR simulation training allows users to gain new skills and apply them to real-life situations. However, the learning curve of this technology from a novice level could influence the expected learning results of a training session. A training approach based on the combination of VR and gamification could speed up this overall learning process and not just for a novice. In this paper we evaluate how gamification in a VR training session can improve the efficiency of the training and the accuracy of the task execution in a real-world practical test. In the training scenario of this study, 50 randomly assigned participants were divided into two groups. The groups were assigned to a gamified and a non-gamified version of the same VR training and were then guided through a step-by-step tutorial outlining how to solve an assembly task. Performance differences were evaluated based on time taken and specific errors made during the training session. The results of this study show, in general, that beneficial effects can be attributed to the use of gamification in the conducted VR training simulation, particularly for the VR novice participants. © 2019 IEEE.",Assembly task; Gamification; Learning transfer; Training; Virtual reality; Virtual training,Personnel training; Virtual reality; Assembly tasks; Beneficial effects; Controlled environment; Gamification; Learning Transfer; Training simulation; Virtual reality training; Virtual training; E-learning,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074257749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, there are two shortcomings for nowadays virtual assembly training systems. One is that the operators cannot move around the virtual environment in a natural way as people activity in the real world: they are constrained in a fixed position or can only move in a limited space. The other is that most of the virtual assembly training systems are based on geometry constraint modeling only, which lacks haptics feedback. A new type haptics-based virtual environment system for assembly training of complex products is described in this paper. A new low-cost motion simulator is designed and integrated with the virtual environment to realize free walking by human. An automatic data integration interface is developed to transfer geometry, topology, assembly, and physics information from a computer-aided design system to a VR application, and a hierarchical constraint-based data model is rebuilt to construct the virtual assembly environment. Physics-based modeling and haptics feedback are undertaken to simulate the realistic assembly operations. The application examples and evaluation experiments demonstrate that both motion simulator and haptics have great value for training of assembly processes. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.",Assembly training; Haptics; Motion simulator; Physics-based modeling; Virtual reality,Application examples; Assembly operations; Assembly process; Complex products; Computer-aided design systems; Constraint-based; Data integration; Evaluation experiments; Geometry constraints; Haptics; Limited space; Motion simulator; Physics-based modeling; Training Systems; Virtual assembly; Virtual environments; VR applications; Computer aided design; E-learning; Simulators; Topology; Virtual reality; Assembly,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855678280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten individuals, mean age of 51.4 (± 6.7 years), participated of eight 60-minute sessions comprising kinesiotherapy (15min), Nintendo Wii (30min) and Learning transfer (15min) exercises. After training, nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant improvement in total FIM (p = .01) and BERG scores (p = .00), and in some of their subitems: FIM - dressing lower body (p = .01), transfer to bathtub/shower (p = .02) and locomotion: stairs (p = .03); BERG - reaching forward with outstretched arm (p = .01), retrieving object from the floor (p = .04), turning 360 (p = .01), placing alternate foot on step (p < .01), standing with one foot in front (p = .01), and one leg stand (p = .03).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Does the learning of a balance and stability skill exhibit time-course phases and transfer limitations characteristic of the acquisition and consolidation of voluntary movement sequences? Here we followed the performance of young adults trained in maintaining balance while standing on a moving platform synchronized with a virtual reality road travel scene. The training protocol included eight 3 min long iterations of the road scene. Center of Pressure (CoP) displacements were analyzed for each task iteration within the training session, as well as during tests at 24h, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-training to test for consolidation phase (""offline"") gains and assess retention. In addition, CoP displacements in reaction to external perturbations were assessed before and after the training session and in the 3 subsequent post-training assessments (stability tests). There were significant reductions in CoP displacements as experience accumulated within session, with performance stabilizing by the end of the session. However, CoP displacements were further reduced at 24h post-training (delayed ""offline"" gains) and these gains were robustly retained. There was no transfer of the practice-related gains to performance in the stability tests. The time-course of learning the balance maintenance task, as well as the limitation on generalizing the gains to untrained conditions, are in line with the results of studies of manual movement skill learning. The current results support the conjecture that a similar repertoire of basic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity may underlay skill (procedural, ""how to"" knowledge) acquisition and skill memory consolidation in voluntary and balance maintenance tasks.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to verify the transference/generalization of gains obtained by training in Virtual Reality environments (VR) to similar balance tasks in real environment in patients with chronic sequels of Stroke. Participants: Twenty-nine chronic stroke patients. Interventions: Three sessions of balance training in VR using five games from Nintendo Wii FitTM for experimental group (EG). Verbal orientation about falls preventions for control group (CG). Main outcome measures: The transference/generalization of gains obtained in VR training was assessed through performance in four balance tests with similar demand than games using a force plate in two assessment time points: at baseline (BA) and at end of study (EA). Results: The ANOVA for repeated measure showed that there were statistically significant improvements for all trained games after the training. However, there were no statistical significant differences in the balance tests performance between BA and EA, for both groups.

Both groups experienced two slips, one during baseline and the other during the transfer of training trial. The training group underwent 12 simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a virtual reality scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group performed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected during all the sessions. Results demonstrated a reduced incidence of falls in the training group during the transfer of training trial as compared to the control group. The training group was able to transfer reactive control strategies learned during training to the second slip trial. The reactive adjustments included reduced slip distance. Additionally, gait parameters reflective of gait instability (stride length, step width, variability in stride velocity) reduced after walking in the VR environment for 15–20 min.

Materials and Methods: This study included 29 people with chronic stroke randomized into two groups: experimental (EG, n = 16) and control (CG, n = 13). The EG performed three sessions of balance training with VR using a platform-based videogame (Nintendo Wii Fit system™) for 1 week. The CG received no intervention. Transfer was evaluated through balance tests on the force platform Balance Master™, performed before and after the intervention period, for both groups. Results: The analysis of variance for repeated measures for game performance in the EG showed statistically significant improvement in scores in all five games after training (AT). In contrast, similar analysis for balance tests for the EG and CG showed no significant differences in performance index scores derived from the Balance Master tests after the intervention period for both groups. Conclusion: People with chronic stroke showed performance improvement AT with VR, but there was no transfer of the gains obtained to an untrained task with similar balance demands. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Learning; Paresis; Postural balance; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Virtual reality exposure therapy,adult; body equilibrium; cerebrovascular accident; complication; devices; female; human; male; middle aged; procedures; psychology; stroke rehabilitation; virtual reality; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Functional Performance; Postural Balance; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068605388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The training group experienced 12 simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a VR scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group completed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography data were collected during all the sessions. Results demonstrated the proactive adjustments such as increased trunk flexion at heel contact after training. Reactive adjustments included reduced time to peak activations of knee flexors, reduced knee coactivation, reduced time to trunk flexion, and reduced trunk angular velocity after training.

This system depends on a structured posture space, which comprises a set of dance elements that represent key moments - 'postures', that typically will be so briefly held as to experience as a fleeting moment in a flux - in the dance movements whose performance we are attempting to assess. The recording captured from the Kinect allows the parsing of dance movement into a structured posture space using the spherical self-organizing map (SSOM). From this, a unique descriptor can be obtained by following gesture trajectories through posture space on the SSOM, which appropriately reflects the subtleties of ballet dance movements. Consequently, the system can recognize the category of movement the student is attempting, and this allows us make a quantitative assessment of individual movements. Based on the experimental results, the proposed system appears to be very effective for recognition and offering generalization across instances of movement. Thus, it is possible for the construction of assessment and visualization of ballet dance movements performed by the student in an instructional, virtual reality setting. © 2014 IEEE.",CAVE virtual reality environment; dance assesment; dance traning system; gesture recognition; spherical-self-organizing map,Caves; Conformal mapping; E-learning; Gesture recognition; Self organizing maps; Students; Assesment; Computer-based system; dance traning system; Gesture trajectories; Kinect sensors; Quantitative assessments; Skeleton joints; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930464608,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However precision motor tasks that require high accuracy have been rarely studied in the context of VE, especially in Large Screen Image Display (LSID) platforms. An example of such a motor task is the basketball free throw, where the player has to throw a ball in a 46cm wide basket placed at 4.2m away from her. In order to determine the best VE training conditions for this type of skill, we proposed and compared three training paradigms. These training conditions were used to compare the combinations of different user perspectives: first (1PP) and third-person (3PP) perspectives, and the effectiveness of visual guidance. We analysed the performance of eleven amateur subjects who performed series of free throws in a real and immersive 1:1 scale environment under the proposed conditions. The results show that ball speed at the moment of the release in 1PP was significantly lower compared to real world, supporting the hypothesis that distance is underestimated in large screen VEs. However ball speed in 3PP condition was more similar to the real condition, especially if combined with guidance feedback. Moreover, when guidance information was proposed, the subjects released the ball at higher - and closer to optimal - position (5-7% higher compared to no-guidance conditions). This type of information contributes to better understand the impact of visual feedback on the motor performance of users who wish to train motor skills using immersive environments. Moreover, this information can be used by exergames designers who wish to develop coaching systems to transfer motor skills learned in VEs to real practice.

billiards,,Embodied virtual reality for the study of real-world motor learning,"Motor-learning literature focuses on simple laboratory-tasks due to their controlled manner and the ease to apply manipulations to induce learning and adaptation. Recently, we introduced a billiards paradigm and demonstrated the feasibility of real-world-neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and mobile-brain-imaging. Here we developed an embodied virtual-reality (VR) environment to our real-world billiards paradigm, which allows to control the visual feedback for this complex real-world task, while maintaining sense of embodiment. The setup was validated by comparing real-world ball trajectories with the trajectories of the virtual balls, calculated by the physics engine. We then ran our learning protocol in the embodied VR. Subjects played billiard shots when they held the physical cue and hit a physical ball on the table while seeing it all in VR. We found comparable learning trends in the embodied VR to those we previously reported in the physical real-world task. Embodied VR can be used for learning real-world tasks in a highly controlled environment which enables applying visual manipulations, common in laboratory-tasks and rehabilitation, to a real-world full-body task. Embodied VR enables to manipulate feedback and apply perturbations to isolate and assess interactions between specific motor-learning components, thus enabling addressing the current questions of motor-learning in real-world tasks. Such a setup can be used for rehabilitation, where VR is gaining popularity but the transfer to the real-world is currently limited, presumably, due to the lack of embodiment.

In a between-subjects experiment, 100 participants were trained to assemble a 3D cube in one of four conditions (physical, virtual and with trainer&#x0027;s verbal assistance or not). The results demonstrate that the best-performing conditions, both in terms of successful assemblies and time performance, are the ones that the physical objects are included in the training, while no significant difference is found when the trainer&#x0027;s verbal assistance is present or absent during training. Additionally, we address the validity of a practical TCXB list as a tool for supporting the design of VIT systems.

However, it is unclear how the amount of correspondence between a virtual interaction metaphor to the real-world equivalent, otherwise known as dimensional symmetry, affects bimanual pscyhomotor skills training and how skills learned in the virtual simulation transfer to the real world. How does the number of degrees of freedom enhance or hinder the learning process? Does the increase in dimensional symmetry affect cognitive load? In an empirical evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of a natural 6-DOF interaction metaphor to a simplified 3-DOF metaphor. Our simulation interactively educates users in the step-by-step process of taking a precise measurement using calipers and micrometers in a simulated technical workbench environment. We conducted a usability study to evaluate the user experience and pedagogical benefits using measures including a pre and post cognition questionnaire over all levels of Bloom's taxonomy, workload assessment, system usability, and real world psychomotor assessment tasks. Results from the pre and post cognition questionnaires suggest that learning outcomes improved throughout all levels of Bloom's taxonomy for both conditions, and trends in the data suggest that the 6-DOF metaphor was more effective in real-world skill transference compared to the 3-DOF metaphor. © 2015 IEEE.",Bimanual interaction; dimensional symmetry; psychomotor skills education,Blooms (metal); Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Education; Human computer interaction; Personnel training; Surveys; Taxonomies; Virtual reality; Bi-manual interaction; Education and training; Empirical evaluations; Immersive virtual environments; Interaction metaphors; Number of degrees of freedom; Precise measurements; Virtual interactions; E-learning,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954500994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/t23111-000] (9999-23111-000),,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The training of new employees is essential to ensure premium quality products and processes. New technologies for training such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) receive a growing amount of attention by the scientific community, especially in the industrial domain. Due to its possibility to work hands-free while providing users with necessary augmented information, HMDs can enhance the quality and efficiency of assembly training tasks. However, comprehensive evaluations in industrial environments regarding the training transfer using augmented reality (AR) technologies are still very limited. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by conducting a user study with two groups and 30 participants, measuring the training transfer. We compare the effects of two slightly different HMD-based training applications. The first group complete a tutorial, beginner, intermediate and expert training level, while the second group received an additional quiz level. Results show that group two needed 17% more time to complete the training but made 79% less sequence mistakes compared to the first group.

After that, transfer of training to the actual assembly was evaluated. Performance measures used to assess transfer of training include time to complete task and number of frustration points during task.

Many studies have investigated the nature of these spatial representations. It is well established that we use allocentric information in real-time and memory-guided movements. Most studies relied on small-scale and static experiments, leaving it unclear whether similar paradigms yield the same results on a larger scale using dynamic objects. We created a virtual reality task that required participants to encode the landing position of a virtual ball thrown by an avatar. Encoding differed in the nature of the task in that it was either purely perceptual (“view where the ball landed while standing still”—Experiment 1) or involved an action (“intercept the ball with the foot just before it lands”—Experiment 2). After encoding, participants were asked to place a real ball at the remembered landing position in the virtual scene. In some trials, we subtly shifted either the thrower or the midfield line on a soccer field to manipulate allocentric coding of the ball’s landing position. In both experiments, we were able to replicate classic findings from small-scale experiments and to generalize these results to different encoding tasks (perception vs. action) and response modes (reaching vs. walking-and-placing). Moreover, we found that participants preferably encoded the ball relative to the thrower when they had to intercept the ball, suggesting that the use of allocentric information is determined by the encoding task by enhancing task-relevant allocentric information. Our findings indicate that results previously obtained from memory-guided reaching are not restricted to small-scale movements, but generalize to whole-body movements in large-scale dynamic scenes. © 2020, The Author(s).",Allocentric; Egocentric; Perception and action; Spatial representation; Virtual reality,adult; article; body movement; brain; female; foot; human; human experiment; male; memory; perception; soccer; virtual reality; walking,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086027347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study design: we had 64 individuals, 32 of which were individuals with DMD and 32 were typically developing individuals. Methods: The groups practiced two coincidence timing tasks. In the more tangible button-press task, the individuals were required to ‘intercept’ a falling virtual object at the moment it reached the interception point by pressing a key on the computer. In the more abstract task, they were instructed to ‘intercept’ the virtual object by making a hand movement in a virtual environment using a webcam. Results and Conclusions: For individuals with DMD, conducting a coincidence timing task in a virtual environment facilitated transfer to the real environment. However, we emphasize that a task practiced in a virtual environment should have higher rates of difficulties than a task practiced in a real environment.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Virtual environments can be used to promote improved performance in ?real-world? environments. Virtual environments offer the opportunity to create paradigms similar ?real-life? tasks, however task complexity and difficulty levels can be manipulated, graded and enhanced to increase likelihood of success in transfer of learning and performance.

Whereas such perturbations are useful for studying how the central nervous system adapts and generalizes to novel dynamics, they are rarely encountered in daily life. The most common perturbations that we experience are changes in the weights of objects that we hold. Here, we use a center-out, free-reaching task, in which we can manipulate the weight of a participant's hand to examine adaptation and generalization following naturalistic perturbations. In both trial-by-trial paradigms and block-based paradigms, we find that learning converges rapidly (on a timescale of approximately two trials), and this learning generalizes mostly to movements in nearby directions with a unimodal pattern. However, contrary to studies using more artificial perturbations, we find that the generalization has a strong global component. Furthermore, the generalization is enhanced with repeated exposure of the same perturbation. These results suggest that the familiarity of a perturbation is a major factor in movement generalization and that several theories of the neural control of movement, based on perturbations applied by robots or in virtual reality, may need to be extended by incorporating prior influence that is characterized by the familiarity of the perturbation. ©2013 the American Physiological Society.",Familiarity; Generalization function; Motor generalization; Reaching movements; State-space model,"adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; hand function; hand movement; human; learning; male; motor performance; priority journal; sensorimotor function; task performance; virtual reality; weight change; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Biomechanics; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Hand; Humans; Male; Movement; Psychomotor Performance",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871868651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-immersive virtual environments (VEs) are popular interventions to promote motor learning in children with hemiplegic CP. Greater understanding of performance variability as compared to typically developing (TD) peers during motor learning in VEs may inform clinical decisions about practice dose and challenge progression. Purpose: (1) To quantify within-child (i.e., across different timepoints) and between-child (i.e., between children at the same timepoint) variability in motor skill acquisition, retention and transfer in a non-immersive VE in children with CP as compared to TD children; and (2) To explore the relationship between the amount of within-child variability during skill acquisition and learning outcomes. Methods: Secondary data analysis of 2 studies in which 13 children with hemiplegic CP and 67 TD children aged 7–14 years undertook repeated trials of a novel standing postural control task in acquisition, retention and transfer sessions. Changes in performance across trials and sessions in children with CP as compared to TD children and between younger (7–10 years) and older (11–14 years) children were assessed using mixed effects models. Raw scores were converted to z-scores to meet model distributional assumptions. Performance variability was quantified as the standard deviation of z-scores. Results: TD children outperformed children with CP and older children outperformed younger children at each session. Older children with CP had the least between-child variability in acquisition and the most in retention, while older TD children demonstrated the opposite pattern. Younger children with CP had consistently high between-child variability, with no difference between sessions. Within-child variability was highest in younger children, regardless of group. Within-child variability was more pronounced in TD children as compared to children with CP. The relationship between the amount of within-child variability in performance and performance outcome at acquisition, retention and transfer sessions was task-specific, with a positive correlation for 1 study and a negative correlation in the other. Conclusions: Findings, though preliminary and limited by small sample size, can inform subsequent research to explore VE-specific causes of performance variability, including differing movement execution requirements and individual characteristics such as motivation, attention and visuospatial abilities. © Copyright © 2021 Cheng, Anderson and Levac.",cerebral palsy; children; motor learning; variability; virtual environment; virtual reality,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103329101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cook and colleagues [5] systematically reviewed 609 studies with 35226 medical trainees and reported that medical simulation training is consistently associated with large effect sizes for outcomes in the areas of knowledge, skills, and behaviours, and moderate effects for patient-related outcomes. An additional fundamental question is whether subjective or objective performance gains, seen during VR training, will transfer into real life situations [6]. [...]investigation of the main factors that can aid effective learning transfer is needed. In our virtual simulation, we provided vibration at the top of the hand instead of torque force, a visual colour change of the bolt and the wheel instead of visible rotation and resistance forces, and increased sound intensity instead of the more complex signal change that would be observed in a real tool.",2504776513,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Cooper, Natalia;Millela, Ferdinando;Cant, Iain;White, Mark D;Meyer, Georg",," University of Liverpool

Two visual cues, A1 and B1, were followed by a tone (O1), and another two cues, A2 and B2, were followed by another tone (O2). During differential Pavlovian conditioning, A1 was paired with an instructed unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a flashing white screen, whereas A2 was not. All cues and outcomes were then presented at test, in the absence of the US, and suppression ratios were calculated for multiple response topographies (shots, hits, and breaks). Clear evidence of the suppression of shots was seen for A1 and B1, with no suppression being seen for either A2 or B2. Presentations of O1 and O2 resulted in significant suppression of shots and hits, whereas only O1 led to the suppression of breaks. The US expectancy ratings were consistent with these behavioral results. The findings are discussed in the light of differing accounts of acquired equivalence.

The accuracy needs to be conveyed in a multimodal fashion with varying parameterisations still being quantified, and these are a function of task, prior knowledge, sensory efficacy and human perception. Virtual reality (VR) has been integrated from a didactic perspective in many serious games and shown to be effective in the pedological process. This paper interrogates whether didactic processes introduced into a VR serious game, by taking advantage of augmented virtuality to modify game attributes, can be effective for both beginners and experts to a task. The task in question is subjective performance in a clay pigeon shooting simulation. The investigation covers whether modified game attributes influence skill and learning in a complex motor task and also investigates whether this process is applicable to experts as well as beginners to the task. VR offers designers and developers of serious games the ability to provide information in the virtual world in a fashion that is impossible in the real world. This introduces the question of whether this is effective and transfers skill adoption into the real world and also if a-priori knowledge influences the practical nature of this information in the pedagogic process. Analysis is conducted via a between-subjects repeated measure ANOVA using a 2 × 2 factorial design to address these questions. The results show that the different training provided affects the performance in this task (N= 57). The skill improvement is still evidenced in repeated measures when information and guidance is removed. This effect does not exist under a control condition. Additionally, we separate by an expert and non-expert group to deduce if a-priori knowledge influences the effect of the presented information, it is shown that it does not. © 2019, The Author(s).",Learning; Serious game; Training; Virtual reality,E-learning; Personnel training; Sensory perception; Virtual reality; Augmented virtualities; Human perception; Learning; Physical phenomena; Priori knowledge; Repeated measures; Skill development; Subjective performance; Serious games,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067692541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to a general understanding of mental practice by investigating the utility of and participant reaction to a virtual reality maintenance training among underground coal mine first responders. Design/methodology/approach: Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) developed software to provide opportunities for mine rescue team members to learn to inspect, assemble and test their closed-circuit breathing apparatus and to practice those skills. In total, 31 mine rescue team members utilized OMSHR's BG 4 Benching Trainer software and provided feedback to the development team. After training, participants completed a brief post-training questionnaire, which included demographics, perceived training climate and general training evaluation items. Findings: The results overall indicate a generally positive reaction to and high perceived utility of the BG 4 benching software. In addition, the perceived training climate appears to have an effect on the perceived utility of the mental practice virtual reality game, with benchmen from mines with more positive training climates reporting greater perceived efficacy in the training's ability to prepare trainees for real emergencies. Originality/value: This paper helps to broaden current applications of mental practice and is one of the few empirical investigations into a non-rehabilitation virtual reality extension of mental practice. This paper also contributes to the growing literature advocating for greater usage of accurate and well-informed mental practice techniques, tools and methodologies, especially for occupational populations with limitations on exposure to hands-on training.

Virtual reality environments are suggested as an effective alternative for performance of daily life activities. However, there is no evidence in the literature on the use of virtual reality in this population. Objective: Assess motor performance through a motor learning protocol in a coincident timing task. Methods: 10 participants with LGMD and 10 healthy individuals were selected and included in the study to perform a non-immersive virtual reality task divided into three phases: acquisition (20 attempts), retention (5 attempts), and transfer (5 attempts, with speed increase). Results: It is observed that the accuracy of movement improves from the beginning to the end of the acquisition (p = 0.01); however, there is a marginal difference between the groups in block A1 (p = 0.089). Regarding the variability of touches, observed by the variable error, both groups improved performance in all phases. Conclusion: Even with lower performance than the control group at the beginning of the practice, individuals with LGMD showed the potential to optimize motor function during the practice of a non-immersive virtual reality activity and were able to match their performance with the control group after a few attempts. © The authors (2020). this article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

coincidence-timing ,,Short-term motor learning through non-immersive virtual reality task in individuals with down syndrome,"Background Down syndrome (DS) has unique physical, motor and cognitive characteristics. Despite cognitive and motor difficulties, there is a possibility of intervention based on the knowledge of motor learning. However, it is important to study the motor learning process in individuals with DS during a virtual reality task to justify the use of virtual reality to organize intervention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the motor learning process in individuals with DS during a virtual reality task. Methods A total of 40 individuals participated in this study, 20 of whom had DS (24 males and 8 females, mean age of 19 years, ranging between 14 and 30 yrs.) and 20 typically developing individuals (TD) who were matched by age and gender to the individuals with DS. To examine this issue, we used software that uses 3D images and reproduced a coincidence-timing task. Results The results showed that all individuals improved performance in the virtual task, but the individuals with DS that started the task with worse performance showed higher difference from the beginning. Besides that, they were able to retain and transfer the performance with increase of speed of the task. Conclusion Individuals with DS are able to learn movements from virtual tasks, even though the movement time was higher compared to the TD individuals. The results showed that individuals with DS who started with low performance improved coincidence- timing task with virtual objects, but were less accurate than typically developing individuals.",1894173839,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Carlos Bandeira de Mello Monteiro;Talita Dias da Silva;de Abreu, Luiz Carlos;Fregni, Felipe;Vieira de Araujo, Luciano;Fernando Henrique Inocencio Borba Ferreira;Leone, Claudio",,, Copyright BioMed Central 2017, 10.1186/s12883-017-0852-z, Journal Article,,2017,,, English, English,,, London,2017,BMC Neurology,2017,17,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/short-term-motor-learning-through-non-immersive/docview/1894173839/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,, n/a,,," Motor ability , Computer applications , Down syndrome , Three dimensional imaging , Motor skill learning , Age , Cognitive ability , Virtual reality , Motor task performance , Keyboards , Down's syndrome , Skills"," Down syndrome , Virtual reality , Rehabilitation , User-computer interface , Physical therapy modalities",,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Short-term+motor+learning+through+non-immersive+virtual+reality+task+in+individuals+with+down+syndrome&amp;author=Carlos+Bandeira+de+Mello+Monteiro%3BTalita+Dias+da+Silva%3Bde+Abreu%2C+Luiz+Carlos%3BFregni%2C+Felipe%3BVieira+de+Araujo%2C+Luciano%3BFernando+Henrique+Inocencio+Borba+Ferreira%3BLeone%2C+Claudio&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=BMC+Neurology&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existing methods for teaching children how to cross the street safely are difficult to transfer to real life situations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality (VR) environment in teaching children how to cross a street safely. Method: Eighty-six children (55 girls and 31 boys), aged 7-12 years, participated in the study. The children were observed while crossing a real street and tested on a test in the virtual environment (VE) prior to and following VR training. Results: The children in the training group significantly improved their street crossing abilities in the VR simulation as well as in the real street crossing in comparison to the control group. Street crossing became safer with age however, no differences were found between boys and girls. Conclusions: This low-cost and readily available street crossing simulation had a positive effect on children's street crossing behavior and on their self-reported satisfaction. ©2006 IEEE.",,Cost effectiveness; Medical problems; Roads and streets; Street crossing; Street crossing behavior; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41649095719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
driving ,,"Can Driving-Simulator Training Enhance Visual Attention, Cognition, and Physical Functioning in Older Adults?","Virtual reality offers a good possibility for the implementation of real-life tasks in a laboratory-based training or testing scenario. Thus, a computerized training in a driving simulator offers an ecological valid training approach. Visual attention had an influence on driving performance, so we used the reverse approach to test the influence of a driving training on visual attention and executive functions. Thirty-seven healthy older participants (mean age: 71.46 ± 4.09; gender: 17 men and 20 women) took part in our controlled experimental study. We examined transfer effects from a four-week driving training (three times per week) on visual attention, executive function, and motor skill. Effects were analyzed using an analysis of variance with repeated measurements. Therefore, main factors were group and time to show training-related benefits of our intervention. Results revealed improvements for the intervention group in divided visual attention; however, there were benefits neither in the other cognitive domains nor in the additional motor task. Thus, there are no broad training-induced transfer effects from such an ecologically valid training regime. This lack of findings could be addressed to insufficient training intensities or a participant-induced bias following the cancelled randomization process.",2002922416,,,Scholarly Journals," Institute of Physiology and Anatomy, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany , Institute of Physiology and Anatomy, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany , Institute of Training and Computer Science in Sport, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany , Institute of Training and Computer Science in Sport, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany","Haeger, Mathias;Bock, Otmar;Memmert, Daniel;Hüttermann, Stefanie",,," Copyright © 2018 Mathias Haeger et al.; This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.", 10.1155/2018/7547631, Journal Article,,2018,2090-2204,, English, English,,, New York,2018,Journal of Aging Research,2018,2018,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/can-driving-simulator-training-enhance-visual/docview/2002922416/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,,,,," Laboratories , Neurosciences , Psychology , Computer & video games , Older people , Cognitive ability , Memory , Age , Studies , Visual task performance , Cognition & reasoning , Germany",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Can+Driving-Simulator+Training+Enhance+Visual+Attention%2C+Cognition%2C+and+Physical+Functioning+in+Older+Adults%3F&amp;author=Haeger%2C+Mathias%3BBock%2C+Otmar%3BMemmert%2C+Daniel%3BH%C3%BCttermann%2C+Stefanie&amp;volume=2018&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Aging+Research&amp;issn=2090-2204&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Literature shows that the young novice drivers are not careless drivers but they are clueless drivers' - clueless because of their inability to predict the risk ahead of time that might materialize on the forward roadway. Other error-feedback training programs exist that emphasize the teaching of risk awareness and perception skills to young drivers. In the current study, a Virtual reality based risk awareness and perception training program (V-RAPT) was developed on the Oculus Rift and evaluated on a driving simulator. The training program provides 360 degrees' views of 6 high risk driving scenarios towards training the young driver to anticipate and mitigate latent hazards. Twenty-four participants in three experiment groups were trained on one of 3 training programs-VRAPT, RAPT and Control, and were evaluated on a driving simulator. Eye movements were collected throughout the experiment. The simulator evaluation drives included six near-transfer scenarios used in the training and four far-transfer scenarios not used in the training but validated previously in other similar studies. The young drivers trained on the V-RAPT were found to anticipate a significantly greater proportion (86.25%) of the potential latent hazards as compared to the RAPT trained young drivers (62.36%) and control trained drivers (30.97%). The VR-based training program is shown to be effective in improving young drivers' ability to anticipate latent threats.

We investigated this issue for locomotor behavior and tested the generality of Fajen and Warren's [2003] steering dynamics model. Participants walked to a stationary goal while avoiding a stationary obstacle in matched physical and virtual environments. There were small, but reliable, differences in locomotor paths, with a larger maximum deviation (Δ = 0.16 m), larger obstacle clearance (Δ = 0.16 m), and slower walking speed (Δ = 0.13 m/s) in the virtual environment. Separate model fits closely captured the mean virtual and physical paths (R2 > 0.98). Simulations implied that the path differences are not because of walking speed or a 50% distance compression in virtual environments, but might be a result of greater uncertainty about the egocentric location of virtual obstacles. On the other hand, paths had similar shapes in the two environments with no difference in median curvature and could be modeled with a single set of parameter values (R2 > 0.95). Fajen and Warren's original parameters successfully generalized to new virtual and physical object configurations (R2 > 0.95). These results justify the use of virtual environments to study locomotor behavior. © 2007, ACM.

A persistent issue, however, has been a lack of data guiding (1) the ideal degree of integration into traditional pilot training and (2) the optimal amount of structure for student pilots' training experience. The goal of this study was to evaluate the aforementioned PTN model when applied to the U.S. Air Force Academy's flight training program with special emphasis on the ideal degree of structure for airmanship success. To this end, a quasi-experimental approach was utilized, which included 60 USAFA cadets enrolled in the Powered Flight Program who were pseudo-randomly assigned to three independent groups with varying degrees of structure. The groups (i.e., High Structured, Scaffolded, and Low Structured Groups) represented a spectrum of VR-training curriculum structure ranging from a rigid, lineal objective-completion model (akin to traditional flight training) to an unguided, Montessori-like model. With group assignment as the independent variable, live-flight performance was used as the dependent variable, which was quantified using flight grade cards, number of 'landing tabs' (i.e., modified solos) awarded, and a subjective Instructor Pilot rating. Subjective feedback was also obtained from students in each condition. Initial effectiveness data indicated an increased level of perceived self-efficacy in coordination with increased virtual reality simulator time as well as an accelerated rate of positive transfer to real aircraft from the strictly structured and scaffolded groups. The results of this study allow for initial recommendations for forthcoming airmanship training and undergraduate pilot training augmentation efforts across the Department of Defense. © 2019 IEEE.",,Curricula; Military aviation; Structural optimization; Virtual reality; Artificial intelligence technologies; Department of Defense; Experimental approaches; Independent variables; Perceived self-efficacy; Training experiences; U.s. air force academies; Virtual reality simulator; Training aircraft,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068579778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such evaluation is motivated by the need to facilitate transfer of model/knowledge from VE to the Real Environment (RE), where it is crucial for the VE to trigger similar user behavior as in the RE. This paper discusses the application of such concept to evaluate interactions of forklift operation in the VE. First, a Virtual Reality (VR) forklift simulator is developed using motion capture and 3D reconstruction methods to mimic HMI of the real forklift operation. Then, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is used for temporal evaluation of operation behaviors in VE and RE. Results of DTW (i.e. distance and correlation) are used as objective measures to evaluate fidelity of VE during forklift operations on the simulator. Results suggest the proposed forklift simulator triggers operation behavior which is similar (highly correlated) to that of real forklift operation. The contributions of this paper are (a) the novel VR forklift simulator system to realize interactions of real forklift in the VE, and (b) the proposed objective measures for temporal evaluation of the fidelity of VE. © 2019 IEEE.",,Behavioral research; Intelligent robots; Man machine systems; Materials handling equipment; Simulators; Dynamic time warping algorithms; Evaluation methodologies; Highly-correlated; Human-machine interaction; Objective measure; Real environments; Simulator systems; Temporal evaluation; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078030425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Human locomotor adaptation requires feedback and feed-forward control processes to maintain an appropriate walking pattern. Adaptation may require the use of visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory environment and back, as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight, the prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our previous paper, we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however, larger overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects, in the absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback, are believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because, in the absence of relevant external dynamic cues such as optic flow, reliance on body-based cues is enhanced during gait tasks through multisensory integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of optic flow on tactile-stimulated split-belt adaptation as a paradigm to facilitate the sensorimotor adaptation process. Twenty healthy young adults, separated into two matched groups, participated in the study. All participants performed an overground walking trial followed by a split-belt treadmill adaptation protocol. The tactile group (TC) received vibratory plantar tactile stimulation only, whereas the virtual reality and tactile group (VRT) received an additional concurrent visual stimulation: a moving virtual corridor, inducing perceived self-motion. A post-treadmill overground trial was performed to determine adaptation transfer. Interlimb coordination of spatiotemporal and kinetic variables was quantified using symmetry indices and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Marked changes of step length characteristics were observed in both groups during split-belt adaptation. Stance and swing time symmetries were similar in the two groups, suggesting that temporal parameters are not modified by optic flow. However, whereas the TC group displayed significant stance time asymmetries during the post-treadmill session, such aftereffects were absent in the VRT group. The results indicated that the enhanced transfer resulting from exposure to plantar cutaneous vibration during adaptation was alleviated by optic flow information. The presence of visual self-motion information may have reduced proprioceptive gain during learning. Thus, during overground walking, the learned proprioceptive split-belt pattern is more rapidly overridden by visual input due to its increased relative gain. The results suggest that when visual stimulation is provided during adaptive training, the system acquires the novel movement dynamics while maintaining the ability to flexibly adapt to different environments.

gait training ,,Validation of wearable visual feedback for retraining foot progression angle using inertial sensors and an augmented reality headset,"Background Gait retraining interventions using real-time biofeedback have been proposed to alter the loading across the knee joint in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Despite the demonstrated benefits of these conservative treatments, their clinical adoption is currently obstructed by the high complexity, spatial demands, and cost of optical motion capture systems. In this study we propose and evaluate a wearable visual feedback system for gait retraining of the foot progression angle (FPA). Methods The primary components of the system are inertial measurement units, which track the human movement without spatial limitations, and an augmented reality headset used to project the visual feedback in the visual field. The adapted gait protocol contained five different target angles ranging from 15 degrees toe-out to 5 degrees toe-in. Eleven healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill, and the protocol was performed using both an established laboratory visual feedback driven by optical motion capture, and the proposed wearable system. Results and conclusions The wearable system tracked FPA with an accuracy of 2.4 degrees RMS and ICC=0.94 across all target angles and subjects, when compared to an optical motion capture reference. In addition, the effectiveness of the biofeedback, reflected by the number of steps with FPA value ±2 degrees from the target, was found to be around 50% in both wearable and laboratory approaches.

The hardware and software framework of the virtual reality (VR) system, the method to simulate the virtual scene and human, the flow of simulation for operating were given. Three operations which complete the process of obtaining food from cupboard and heating food in a microwave oven, and three types of objects in degree of freedom(DOF) were given detailed analysis. The three operations are: grasp-transfer-release free object, push/pop drawer, open/close cabinet door. The three types of objects are: 6 DOF objects which can be moved to any position and orientation, cabinet door which can be rotated around a fixed axis within a range of angle, drawer which can be moved along a direction within a range of distance. The algorithm and C++ code to implement the operation on the three types of objects using the VR system were given. The operation system was applied successfully to the verification of design for the cupboard in the space kitchen of the future long-term manned spacecraft. The results showed that the operation system was a real-time system, could be used to all operations in spacecraft, and was a useful system for verification of designs in developing and training for mission preparation.

For a VR simulation to elicit effective transfer of training to the real-world, it must provide a sufficient level of validity, that is, it must be representative of the real-world skill. In order to develop the most effective simulations, assessments of validity should be carried out prior to implementing simulations in training. The aim of this work was to test elements of the physical fidelity, psychological fidelity and construct validity of a VR golf putting simulation. Self-report measures of task load and presence in the simulation were taken following real and simulated golf putting to assess psychological and physical fidelity. The performance of novice and expert golfers in the simulation was also compared as an initial test of construct validity. Participants reported a high degree of presence in the simulation, and there was little difference between real and virtual putting in terms of task demands. Experts performed significantly better in the simulation than novices (p =.001, d = 1.23), and there was a significant relationship between performance on the real and virtual tasks (r =.46, p =.004). The results indicated that the simulation exhibited an acceptable degree of construct validity and psychological fidelity. However, some differences between the real and virtual tasks emerged, suggesting further validation work is required. © 2020, The Author(s).",Construct validity; Simulation; Sport; Training; VR,Golf; User experience; Construct validity; Nuclear decommissioning; Real-world; Task demand; Test elements; Training purpose; Transfer of trainings; VR simulation; Virtual reality,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092909275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They offer both practical and pedagogical benefits, but there are concerns about the effect that perceptual deficiencies in VR systems (e.g. reduced haptic information, and stereoscopic display distortions) may have on learning and performance. ‘Specificity of learning’ theories suggest that VR could be ineffective (or even detrimental) if important differences (e.g. perceptual deficiencies) exist between practice and real task performance conditions. Nevertheless, ‘structural learning’ theories suggest VR could be a useful training tool, despite these deficiencies, because a trainee can still learn the underlying structure of the behaviour. We explored these theoretical predictions using golf putting as an exemplar skill. Method: In Experiment 1 we used a repeated measures design to assess putting accuracy (radial error) and quiet eye duration of expert golfers (n = 18) on real putts before and after 40 VR ‘warm up’ putts. In Experiment 2, novice golfers (n = 40) were assigned to either VR or real-world putting training. Putting accuracy and quiet eye durations were then assessed on a real-world retention test. Results: Both visual guidance (quiet eye) and putting accuracy were disrupted temporarily when moving from VR to real putting (Experiment 1). However, real-world and VR practice produced comparable improvements in putting accuracy in novice golfers (Experiment 2). Conclusion: Overall, the results suggest that: (i) underlying skill structures can be learned in VR and transferred to the real-world; (ii) perceptual deficiencies will place limits on the use of VR. These findings demonstrate the challenges and opportunities for VR as a training tool, and emphasise the need to empirically test the costs and benefits of specific systems before deploying VR training. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Quiet eye; Skill acquisition; Sport; Stereoscopic; Transfer; VR,article; clinical article; gaze; golf; human; human experiment; learning; motor performance; prediction; virtual reality; warm up,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086586041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"An influential idea in cognitive neuroscience is that perception and action are highly separable brain functions, implemented in distinct neural systems. In particular, this theory predicts that the functional distinction between grasping, a skilled action, and manual estimation, a type of perceptual report, should be mirrored by a split between their respective control systems. This idea has received support from a variety of dissociations, yet many of these findings have been criticized for failing to pinpoint the source of the dissociation. In this study, we devised a novel approach to this question, first targeting specific grasp control mechanisms through visuomotor adaptation, then testing whether adapted mechanisms were also involved in manual estimation-a response widely characterized as perceptual in function. Participants grasped objects in virtual reality that could appear larger or smaller than the actual physical sizes felt at the end of each grasp. After brief exposure to a size perturbation, manual estimates were biased in the same direction as the maximum grip apertures of grasping movements, indicating that the adapted mechanism is active in both tasks, regardless of the perception-action distinction. Additional experiments showed that the transfer effect generalizes broadly over space (Exp. 1B) and does not appear to arise from a change in visual perception (Exp. 2). We discuss two adaptable mechanisms that could have mediated the observed effect: (a) an afferent proprioceptive mechanism for sensing grip shape; and (b) an efferent visuomotor transformation of size information into a grip-shaping motor command.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Grip force has been studied widely in a variety of interaction and movement tasks, however, not much is known about the timing of the grip force control in preparation for interaction with objects. For example, it is unknown whether and how the temporal preparation for a collision is related to (the prediction of) the impact load. To study this question, we examined the anticipative timing of the grip force in preparation for impact loads. We designed a collision task with different types of load forces in a controlled virtual environment. Participants interacted with a robotic device (KINARM, BKIN Technologies, Kingston) whose handles were equipped with force sensors which the participants held in precision grip. Representations of the hand and objects were visually projected on a virtual reality display and forces were applied onto the participant's hand to simulate a collision with the virtual objects. The collisions were alternating between the two hands to allow transfer and learning between the hands. The results show that there is immediate transfer of object information between the two hands, since the grip force levels are (almost) fully adjusted after one collision with the opposite hand. The results also show that the grip force levels are nicely adjusted based on the mass and stiffness of the object. Surprisingly, the temporal onset of the grip force build up did not depend on the impact load, so that participants avoid slippage by adjusting the other grip force characteristics (e.g., grip force level and rate of change), therefore considering these self-imposed timing constraints. With the use of catch trials, for which no impact occurred, we further analyzed the temporal profile of the grip force. The catch trial data showed that the timing of the grip force peak is also independent of the impact load and its timing, which suggests a time-locked planning of the complete grip force profile.

This obviously presents a major challenge in the rehabilitation of a paretic limb since voluntary control of physical movement is limited. Here, we describe a novel training scheme we have developed that has the potential to circumvent this major challenge. We exploited the voluntary control of one hand and provided real-time movement-based manipulated sensory feedback as if the other hand is moving. Visual manipulation through virtual reality (VR) was combined with a device that yokes left-hand fingers to passively follow right-hand voluntary finger movements. In healthy subjects, we demonstrate enhanced within-session performance gains of a limb in the absence of voluntary physical training. Results in healthy subjects suggest that training with the unique VR setup might also be beneficial for patients with upper limb hemiparesis by exploiting the voluntary control of their healthy hand to improve rehabilitation of their affected hand. © 2017 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.",Behavior; Cross-education; Finger sequence; Issue 127; Motor learning; Sensory feedback; Virtual reality; Visual perception,hand; human; motor performance; movement (physiology); physiology; virtual reality; Hand; Humans; Motor Skills; Movement; Virtual Reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031003576,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore important to design an effective training and assessment strategy to facilitate the potentials of each child in readiness to drive the device. The use of virtual reality (VR) technology for wheelchair training purposes is therefore considered. The skills acquired during training in a virtual reality system should be observable in the functional activities of the learner. It is necessary to evaluate the degree and the permanence of the skills learnt from the virtual environment to other activities outside the training environment. The mode of evaluation applied during conventional wheelchair training could provide the basis upon which permanence of skills is determined after training in virtual reality. Thus, an induction factor is proposed as a measure of the transfer of powered wheelchair control skills from virtual reality to the functional activities of daily living by the learner. The outcomes show that virtual reality technology could offer an appropriate means of providing powered wheelchair training that can be tailored to the needs of the learner. © 2009 IOS Press.

This study aimed to examine the usability of a newly designed virtual reality (VR) environment simulating the operation of an automated teller machine (ATM) for assessment and training. Design. Part I involved evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of a non-immersive VR program simulating an ATM (VR-ATM). Part II consisted of a clinical trial providing baseline and post-intervention outcome assessments. Setting. A rehabilitation hospital and university-based teaching facilities were used as the setting. Participants. A total of 24 persons in the community with acquired brain injury (ABI) - 14 in Part I and 10 in Part II - made up the participants in the study. Interventions. In Part I, participants were randomized to receive instruction in either an ""early"" or a ""late"" VR-ATM program and were assessed using both the VR program and a real ATM. In Part II, participants were assigned in matched pairs to either VR training or computer-assisted instruction (CAI) teaching programs for six 1-hour sessions over a three-week period. Outcome Measures. Two behavioral checklists based on activity analysis of cash withdrawals and money transfers using a real ATM were used to measure average reaction time, percentage of incorrect responses, level of cues required, and time spent as generated by the VR system; also used was the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination. Results. The sensitivity of the VR-ATM was 100% for cash withdrawals and 83.3% for money transfers, and the specificity was 83% and 75%, respectively. For cash withdrawals, the average reaction time of the VR group was significantly shorter than that of the CAI group (p = 0.021). We found no significant differences in average reaction time or accuracy between groups for money transfers, although we did note positive improvement for the VR-ATM group. Conclusion. We found the VR-ATM to be usable as a valid assessment and training tool for relearning the use of ATMs prior to real-life practice in persons with ABI. © 2010 Fong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adult; article; brain injury; clinical trial; computer assisted therapy; computer interface; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; daily life activity; female; human; instrumentation; male; methodology; middle aged; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; sensitivity and specificity; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Brain Injuries; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reaction Time; Sensitivity and Specificity; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; User-Computer Interface",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951541583,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the ecological validity of the simulation is often taken for granted without having been formally established. If participants were to perceive the real situation and its virtual equivalent in a different fashion, the generalization of the results obtained in virtual reality to real life would be highly questionable. We tested the ecological validity of virtual reality in this context by comparing the timing of interceptive actions based upon actually falling objects and their simulated counterparts. The results show very limited differences as a function of whether participants were confronted with a real ball or a simulation thereof. And when present, such differences were limited to the first trial only.

juggling ,,Transfer of Skill from a Virtual Reality Trainer to Real Juggling,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate transfer of training from a virtual reality environment that captures visual and temporal-spatial aspects of juggling, but not the motor demands of juggling. Transfer of skill to real juggling was examined by comparing juggling performance of novices that either experienced both the virtual training protocol and real juggling practice, or only practiced real juggling. After ten days of training, participants who have alternated between real and virtual training demonstrated comparable performance to those who only practiced real juggling. Moreover, they adapted better to instructed changes in temporal-spatial constraints. These results imply that juggling relevant skill subcomponents can be trained in the virtual environment, and support the notion that cognitive aspects of a skill can be separately trained to enhance the acquisition of a complex perceptual-motor task.

The aim of this research is to evaluate the transferability of two aspects of procedural skills, that is, procedural knowledge and technical skills. We established one group with a lecture and three virtual training groups with a combination of output and input devices: a monitor and keyboard/mouse, a head-mounted display (HMD) and joypad, and an HMD and wearable sensors. The task for assessment was a lifeboat launching operation that requires a participant to memorize a 10-step procedure utilizing 14 different pieces of equipment that should be manipulated in each step. Before and after training, we evaluated the participants' procedural knowledge and technical skill on a real lifeboat. The monitor and keyboard/mouse group showed the best performance in a procedural knowledge assessment that addressed visually induced recollections from the real lifeboat. Alternatively, in the assessment of technical skills that determined manipulation ability that requires word-based mnemonics, the HMD and wearable sensors group outperformed the other groups. Moreover, the results showed that the virtual training was a more efficient training format for short-term training than a lecture due to the freedom of observation viewpoint, despite simulator sickness.

Given the risks involved with PW use, safe and effective training methods are needed. Virtual reality training allows users to practice difficult tasks in a safe environment. An additional benefit is that augmented feedback can be provided to optimize learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether providing augmented feedback during powered wheelchair simulator training results in superior performance, and whether skills learned in a virtual environment transfer to real PW driving. Methods: Forty healthy young adults were randomly allocated to two groups: one received augmented feedback during simulator training while the control group received no augmented feedback. PW driving performance was assessed at baseline in both the real and virtual environment (RE and VE), after training in VE and two days later in VE and RE (retention and transfer tests). Results: Both groups showed significantly better task completion time and number of collisions in the VE after training and these results were maintained two days later. The transfer test indicated better performance in the RE compared to baseline for both groups. Because time and collisions interact, a post-hoc 2D Kolmogonov-Smirnov test was used to investigate the differences in the speed-accuracy distributions for each group; a significant difference was found for the group receiving augmented feedback, before and after training, whereas the difference was not significant for the control group. There were no differences at the retention test, suggesting that augmented feedback was most effective during and immediately after training. Conclusions: PW simulator training is effective in improving task completion time and number of collisions. A small effect of augmented feedback was seen when looking at differences in the speed-accuracy distributions, highlighting the importance of accounting for the speed-accuracy tradeoff for PW driving. © 2019 The Author(s).",Augmented feedback; Powered wheelchair; Training; Virtual reality,adult; Article; environmental factor; feedback system; human; human experiment; information technology; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; measurement accuracy; normal human; priority journal; retention time; skill; training; velocity; virtual reality; computer interface; computer simulation; controlled study; feedback system; female; male; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; randomized controlled trial; simulation training; wheelchair; young adult; Computer Simulation; Feedback; Female; Humans; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Simulation Training; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; Wheelchairs; Young Adult,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060140090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional evaluation is critical for the optimization of prosthesis performance during device design and parameter tuning phase. Therefore, we implemented a low-cost physics-based virtual reality environment (VRE) capable of simulating wide range of object grasping and manipulation tasks to enable human-in-the-loop optimization. Importantly, our novel VRE can assess user performance quantitatively using movement kinematics and interaction forces. We present a preliminary experiment to validate our VRE. Four able-bodied subjects performed object transfer tasks with a simulated myoelectric one DoF soft-synergy prosthetic hand, while wearing braces to restrain different levels of wrist motion. We found that the task completion time was similar across conditions, however limited wrist pronation led to more shoulder compensatory motion whereas challenging object orientation caused more torso compensatory motion. © 2019 IEEE.",,Virtual reality; Activities of Daily Living; Functional evaluation; Functional performance; Movement kinematics; Object interactions; Task completion time; Upper limb prosthesis; Virtual-reality environment; Artificial limbs,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077877471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While practicing, students are expected to self-evaluate their performance which may be difficult without timely feedback from a professional. Research into computer-assisted music instrument tutoring (CAMIT) attempts to address this through the use of emerging technologies. In this paper, we study CAMIT for mixed reality (MR) by developing MR:emin, an immersive MR music learning environment for the theremin, an electronic music instrument that is controlled without physical contact. MR:emin integrates a physical theremin with the immersive learning environment. To better understand the effectiveness of such environments, we perform a user study with MR:emin comparing traditional music learning with two virtual learning environments, an immersive one and a non-immersive one. In a between-groups study, 30 participants were trained to play a sequence of notes on the theremin using one of the three training environments. Results of our statistical analysis show that performance error during training is significantly smaller in the immersive MR environment. This does not necessarily lead to improved performance after training; analysis of post-training improvement indicates that immersive training results in the smallest amount of improvement. Participants, however, indicate that the MR:emin environment is more engaging and increases confidence during practice. We discuss potential factors leading to the decrease in learning and provide some environment guidelines to aid in the design of engaging immersive music learning environments. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Immersive learning environments; Learning transfer; Mixed reality; Music pedagogy; Training,Computer aided instruction; Computer music; Mixed reality; Personnel training; Emerging technologies; Environment guidelines; Immersive learning; Learning environments; Learning Transfer; Music pedagogy; Performance error; Virtual learning environments; E-learning,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068827721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transparent walls, a VR possibility that goes beyond real-world options, were beneficial during training and on a direct measure of learning spatial layouts.

A modified TC via virtual reality (VR) may be suitable for the elderly owing to the immediate guidance and feedback regarding movement accuracy. This study explored the cognitive and physical effects of a VR-based TC (VRTC) exercise program on older adults with cognitive impairment (CI). Methods: Sixty older adults with CI were cluster-assigned to either the VRTC or the control group; the intervention was conducted twice weekly for 6 months. Outcomes included cognitive and physical functions. The movement accuracy score and attendance were recorded. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) and multiple regression analyses were performed. Results: Adjusted GEE analysis showed significant interaction effects in the 6-min walk test, 30-s sit-to-stand test, functional reach, 5-m gait speed, and abstract thinking and judgment. Overall, medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.50-0.82) were found in favor of the VRTC group. The average movement accuracy score in the first 3 months significantly predicted improvement in cognitive performance (p = 0.011). Conclusions: The VRTC exercise posed a protective effect for some cognitive and physical functions in older adults with CI. The more engaging the program, the greater the improvement in the cognitive performance. © 2018 S.

To date, most VR-based training systems have been situation based, but this paper examines the utility of VR for a different class of training: learning to execute exact motions, which are often required in sports and the arts. In this paper, we propose an interaction method, called Just Follow Me (JFM), that uses an intuitive ""ghost"" metaphor and a first-person viewpoint for effective motion training. Using the ghost metaphor (GM), JFM visualizes the motion of the trainer in real time as a ghost (initially superimposed on the trainee) that emerges from one's own body. The trainee who observes the motion from the first-person viewpoint ""follows"" the ghostly master as closely as possible to learn the motion. Our basic hypothesis is that such a VR system can help a student learn motion effectively and quickly, comparably to the indirect real-world teaching methods. Our evaluation results show that JFM produces training and transfer effects as good as - and, in certain situations, better than - in the real world. We believe that this is clue to the more direct and correct transfer of proprioceptive information from the trainer to the trainee.",,Ghost metaphor; Human computer interaction; Motion planning; Personnel training; Students; Virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036625537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality opens new opportunities for operator training in complex tasks. It lowers costs and has fewer constraints than traditional training. The ultimate goal of virtual training is to transfer knowledge gained in a virtual environment to an actual real-world setting. This study tested whether a maintenance procedure could be learnt equally well by virtual-environment and conventional training. Forty-two adults were divided into three equally sized groups: virtual training (GVT [generic virtual training]), conventional training (using a real tank suspension and preparation station) and control (no training). Participants then performed the procedure individually in the real environment. Both training types (conventional and virtual) produced similar levels of performance when the procedure was carried out in real conditions. Performance level for the two trained groups was better in terms of success and time taken to complete the task, time spent consulting job instructions and number of times the instructor provided guidance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article reports on the development and evaluation of a virtual reality training system (VRTS) for a specific machining task. A cognitive task analysis of expert machinists was conducted to examine whether this can be effective in developing a VRTS concerning tool length offsetting for a machining center. This analysis provided the necessary information for development and calibration of such a system. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the VRTS was evaluated by conducting an experiment with 29 mechanical engineering students. The VRTS set-up comprised a video projection of the machining center and a physical mock-up of its interface. The system demonstrated positive training transfer for the toll length offsetting task in terms of task accomplishment and of time to complete the task. No positive transfer was observed in terms of task accuracy, probably due to perceptual biases induced by the detailed specification of the VRTS. The present work provides evidence that cognitive task analysis was effective in identifying a number of key skills pertaining to the tool length offsetting task and in implementing ways to facilitate training in such tasks in a virtual environment. This article also demonstrates that even for tasks that include subtle perceptual skills VRTS may be beneficial regardless of the level of physical fidelity, provided that the cognitive organization of a task is adequately mapped in the system.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study evaluated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, developed within the scope of the SKILLS Integrated Project, for industrial maintenance and assembly (IMA) tasks training. VR and AR systems are now widely regarded as promising training platforms for complex and highly demanding IMA tasks. However, there is a need to empirically evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional training methods. Forty expert technicians were randomly assigned to four training groups in an electronic actuator assembly task: VR (training with the VR platform twice), Control-VR (watching a filmed demonstration twice), AR (training with the AR platform once), and Control-AR (training with the real actuator and the aid of a filmed demonstration once). A post-training test evaluated performance in the real task. Results demonstrate that, in general, the VR and AR training groups required longer training time compared to the Control-VR and Control-AR groups, respectively. There were fewer unsolved errors in the AR group compared to the Control-AR group, and no significant differences in final performance between the VR and Control-VR groups, probably due to a ceiling effect created by the use of two training trials in the selected task for participants who were expert technicians. The results suggest that use of the AR platform for training IMA tasks should be encouraged and use of the VR platform for that purpose should be further evaluated.

Smartphones, smartwatches and tablets are everyday objects and life without these unimaginable. New assistive systems such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are becoming increasingly important for various domains, especially for the industrial domain, because they claim to improve the efficiency and quality of procedural tasks. A range of scientific laboratory studies already demonstrated the potential of augmented reality (AR) technologies especially for training tasks. However, most researches are limited in terms of inadequate task complexity, measured variables and lacking comparisons. In this paper, we want to close this gap by introducing a novel multimodal HMD-based training application and compare it to paper-based learning for manual assembly tasks. We perform a user study with 30 participants measuring the training transfer of an engine assembly training task, the user satisfaction and perceived workload during the experiment. Established questionnaires such as the system usability scale (SUS), the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) and the Nasa Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) are used for the assessment. Results indicate significant differences between both learning approaches. Participants perform significantly faster and significantly worse using paper-based instructions. Furthermore, all trainees preferred HMD-based learning for future assembly trainings which was scientifically proven by the UEQ. © 2018 IEEE.",Augmented Reality; Evaluation; Head Mounted Displays; Training,Augmented reality; NASA; Personnel training; Surveys; Assembly trainings; Collaborative systems; Evaluation; Head mounted displays; Laboratory studies; Learning approach; System Usability Scale (SUS); Training applications; Helmet mounted displays,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062171885,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Within the framework of cognitive rehabilitation using virtual reality (VR), one of the major challenges is to study beforehand the effectiveness of the virtual-real transfer of learning and to define cognitive aids. The aim of this experiment was to verify if, after learning spatial knowledge (i.e., a route) in VR, performances can be transferred to reality, then maintained in real time, and improved with the aid of an active navigation (i.e., using a joystick). Ninety student volunteers from the University of Bordeaux 2 (45 men and 45 women) participated in the experiment. The virtual environment (VE) used for learning was a replica of an area of Bordeaux. The factors tested were retention delay (Immediate vs. 48 hours) and type of navigation (Passive virtual vs. Active virtual vs. Real), using three recall tasks: wayfinding, freehand sketch and photograph classification. Our results showed that the virtual-real transfer was not degraded by a retention delay of 48 hours and that active navigation allowed performances to be optimized.

As virtual reality becomes integrated into medical practices, the same questions that confronted the developers of flight simulation also apply to those in the medical domain. Does this technology work for training and education? If so, how well does it work? How much does it cost? Is it less expensive than the alternative training methods? In order to answer these questions the authors have taken a look at the same problems in the history of military simulation. The four techniques used to assess the value of military simulation have been, and still are, task analyses (a detailed, timed description of the actual tasks), standard experimental designs (i.e. the pre-test, post-test control group design), transfer-of-training experiments (where the evaluation metric is the actual task) and various combinations of the three. At present the only evaluation technique being used for VR in medical education is the task analysis.",Standard experimental designs; Task analyses; Transfer effectiveness ratio; Transfer of training,article; computer simulation; human; medical education; medical practice; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; surgical training; virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030992792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the generalizability of synchrony effects, and to eliminate confounds of suggestion, competence and shared intention typical of standard laboratory and field experiments, we used an Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment. Participants, represented as virtual humans, took part in a joint movement activity with two other programmed virtual humans. The timings of the co-participant characters' movements were covertly manipulated to achieve synchrony or non-synchrony with the focal participant. Participants in the synchrony condition reported significantly greater social closeness to their virtual co-participants than those in the non-synchrony condition. Results indicate that synchrony in joint action causes positive social effects and that these effects are robust in a VR setting. The research can potentially inform the development of VR interventions for social and psychological wellbeing. © The Author(s)2018.",,adult; article; field experiment; human; intimacy; joint function; psychological well-being; virtual reality; adolescent; female; male; questionnaire; social behavior; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Social Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality; Young Adult,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042744157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mirror reflections,,Perceptual uncertainty and action consequences independently affect hand movements in a virtual environment,"When we use virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) environments to investigate behaviour or train motor skills, we expect that the insights or skills acquired in VR/AR transfer to real-world settings. Motor behaviour is strongly influenced by perceptual uncertainty and the expected consequences of actions. VR/AR differ in both of these aspects from natural environments. Perceptual information in VR/AR is less reliable than in natural environments, and the knowledge of acting in a virtual environment might modulate our expectations of action consequences. Using mirror reflections to create a virtual environment free of perceptual artefacts, we show that hand movements in an obstacle avoidance task systematically differed between real and virtual obstacles and that these behavioural differences occurred independent of the quality of the available perceptual information.

In particular, the Elements system, involving customized surface computing and tangible interfaces, produces strong treatment effects for upper-limb and cognitive function following traumatic brain injury. The present study evaluated the efficacy of Elements as a virtual rehabilitation approach for stroke survivors. Methods: Twenty-one adults (42-94 years old) with sub-acute stroke were randomized to four weeks of Elements virtual rehabilitation (three weekly 30-40 min sessions) combined with treatment as usual (conventional occupational and physiotherapy) or to treatment as usual alone. Upper-limb skill (Box and Blocks Test), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment and selected CogState subtests), and everyday participation (Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory) were examined before and after inpatient training, and one-month later. Results: Effect sizes for the experimental group (d = 1.05-2.51) were larger compared with controls (d = 0.11-0.86), with Elements training showing statistically greater improvements in motor function of the most affected hand (p = 0.008), and general intellectual status and executive function (p ≤ 0.001). Proportional recovery was two- to three-fold greater than control participants, with superior transfer to everyday motor, cognitive, and communication behaviors. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Conclusion: A course of Elements virtual rehabilitation using goal-directed and exploratory upper-limb movement tasks facilitates both motor and cognitive recovery after stroke. The magnitude of training effects, maintenance of gains at follow-up, and generalization to daily activities provide compelling preliminary evidence of the power of virtual rehabilitation when applied in a targeted and principled manner.

To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. Methods. Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. Results. Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. Conclusions. It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients' and the clinicians' time. The data in this study add support to the proposal to explore novel technologies for incorporation into current practice.

Further, the additional costs of high-resolution stereoscopic displays preclude their widespread use in business and educational settings.

However, a brief period of interaction by walking through the virtual environment with visual feedback can cause dramatic improvement in perceived distance. The goal of the current project was to determine how quickly improvement occurs as a result of walking interaction (Experiment 1) and whether improvement is specific to the distances experienced during interaction, or whether improvement transfers across scales of space (Experiment 2). The results show that five interaction trials resulted in a large improvement in perceived distance, and that subsequent walking interactions showed continued but diminished improvement. Furthermore, interaction with near objects (1-2 m) improved distance perception for near but not far (4-5 m) objects, whereas interaction with far objects broadly improved distance perception for both near and far objects. These results have practical implications for ameliorating distance underperception in immersive virtual reality, as well as theoretical implications for distinguishing between theories of how walking interaction influences perceived distance. © 2014 IEEE.",Distance perception; recalibration; virtual reality,Depth perception; Experiments; Visual communication; Current projects; Distance perception; Immersive virtual reality; Improved distance; Perceived distances; Recalibrations; Visual feedback; Walking through; Virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897409643,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many variables that may contribute to this difference have been investigated but none of them fully explain the distance compression. One approach to this problem that has implications for both VE applications and the study of perceptual mechanisms is to examine the influence of the feedback available to the user. Most generally, we asked whether feedback within a virtual environment would lead to more accurate estimations of distance. Next, given the prediction that some change in behavior would be observed, we asked whether specific adaptation effects would generalize to other indications of distance. Finally, we asked whether these effects would transfer from the VE to the real world. All distance judgments in the head-mounted display (HMD) became near accurate after three different forms of feedback were given within the HMD. However, not all feedback sessions within the HMD altered real world distance judgments. These results are discussed with respect to the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that may be involved in the observed adaptation effects as well as the benefits of feedback for VE applications.

Lower extremity training of individuals post-stroke who used a robot coupled with virtual environments was shown to transfer to improved over-ground locomotion. To elucidate an underlying mechanism that enabled this functional change we compared the kinetic outcomes of training with the robot-virtual reality (VR) system to the robot alone. Eighteen individuals post-stroke participated in a four-week training protocol. One group trained with the robot-VR system and the other group with the robot alone. Training parameters were comparable for the two groups; however, the improvements in moments and powers generated in the ankle and hip of subjects in the robot-VR group were significantly greater than those in the robot alone group.

Our experiments used a transfer-of-adaptation paradigm to test the idea that these two types of reaches are mediated by a common, early perceptual representation. Methods: Subjects reached in virtual reality to positions of visual targets or to match lengths of visible rods. Both tasks used the same set of reach endpoints and similar timing constraints; trajectories were almost indistinguishable. Feedback was given at the end of each reach by a visible marker indicating final hand position or by a second rod whose length indicated distance reached. During some runs, subjects received misleading position- or length-based feedback about the distance component of hand position. We examined the transfer of the resulting visuomotor adaptation between tasks. Results: Subjects showed near-complete adaptation to misleading positional feedback, but a few did not adapt to length-based feedback. Most subjects showed little or no transfer of adaptation between tasks; a small number showed partial or complete transfer. Examination of differences in reach latency between the tasks suggests that subjects who showed transfer of adaptation were using overlapping perceptual strategies in the two tasks; future experiments will examine the possibility that their perceptions of location were less accurate in the virtual reality than those of subjects who did not show transfer of adaptation. We will also attempt to determine what is being adapted in our tasks by examining the limb- and posture-specificity of the adaptation. Conclusions: Positional and length-based reaches are not mediated by a common, early perceptual representation; instead, information about position and length are kept separate until after visuomotor adaptation occurs.",,accuracy; adaptation; article; body position; body posture; controlled study; feedback system; hand movement; human; human experiment; latent period; movement perception; normal human; position effect; task performance; time; virtual reality; vision; visuomotor coordination,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4143056110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the recent ""structure learning"" hypothesis (Braun et al., 2009a), such rapid generalization of related motor skills relies on learning the dynamic and kinematic relationships shared by this set of skills. As a consequence, motor adaptation becomes constrained, effectively leading to a dimensionality reduction of the learning problem; at the same time, adaptation to tasks lying outside the structure becomes biased toward the structure. We tested these predictions by investigating how previously learned structures influence subsequent motor adaptation. Human subjects were making reaching movements in 3D virtual reality, experiencing perturbations either in the vertical or in the horizontal plane. Perturbations were either visuomotor rotations of varying angle or velocity-dependent forces of varying strength. We found that, after extensive training with both kinematic or dynamic perturbations, adaptation to unpracticed, diagonal, perturbations happened along the previously learned structure (vertical or horizontal), and resulting adaptation trajectories were curved. This effect is robust, can be observed on the single-subject level, and occurs during adaptation both within and across trials. Additionally, we demonstrate that structure learning changes involuntary visuomotor reflexes and therefore is not exclusively a high-level cognitive phenomenon.",,1529-2401,0270-6474,https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0958-12.2012,"Journal Article

As neglect is characterized by an impairment in exploring space that greatly affects daily living, VR could be a powerful tool compared to classical paper and pencil tasks and computer training. Nevertheless, available platforms are costly and obstructive. Here we describe a low cost platform for neglect rehabilitation, that using consumer equipments allows the patient to train at home in an intensive fashion. Method: We tested the platform on IB, a chronic neglect patient, who did not benefit from classical rehabilitation. Results: Our results show that IB improved both in terms of neglect and attention. Importantly, these ameliorations lasted at a follow up evaluation 5 months after the last treatment session and generalized to everyday life activities. Conclusions: VR platforms built using equipment technology and following theoretical principles on brain functioning may induce greater ameliorations in visuo-spatial deficits than classical paradigms possibly thanks to the real world scenarios in association with the «visual feedback» of the patient's own body operating in the virtual environment. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, the differences between learning in a VE and a real environment (RE) remain controversial. Purpose: To compare the topographical behavior and spatial representations of patients with traumatic brain injury navigating in a real environment and in a virtual reproduction of this environment. Methods: Twenty-seven subjects with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were consecutively included and allocated to one of two groups. The subjects were taught the same route in either the virtual environment or the real environment and had to recall it twice immediately after learning the route and once after a delay. At the end of these sessions, the subjects were asked to complete three representational tests: a map test, a map recognition test recognition and a scene arrangement test. Results: No significant difference was found between the two groups with regards to demographics, severity of brain injury or episodic memory. As a main result, the number of error rates did not significantly differ between the real and virtual environment [F (1, 25) = 0.679; p = 0.4176)]. Scores on the scene arrangement test were higher in the real environment [U = 32.5; p = 0.01]. Conclusions: Although spatial representations probably differ between the real and virtual environment, virtual reality remains a trusty assessment tool for spatial abilities. Implications for Rehabilitation The transfer of cognitive skills and strategy acquired during rehabilitation programs into daily life situations remains a matter of debate. Virtual reality might provide ecological and rehabilitation scenarios that can be used to look at the daily functioning of patients. The route learning performance after traumatic brain injury shows no significant difference between the real environment and its virtual reproduction in this study. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Cognitive rehabilitation; Topographical disorientation; Transfer; Virtual reality,adult; Brain Injuries; cognitive therapy; comparative study; computer simulation; depth perception; environment; female; human; learning; male; middle aged; neuropsychological test; physiology; recall; recognition; Adult; Brain Injuries; Cognitive Therapy; Computer Simulation; Environment; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition (Psychology); Space Perception,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879980435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as mostly artificial tasks have been investigated, transfer of results to tasks in sports and rehabilitation remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, the effect of different concurrent feedback was evaluated in trunk-arm rowing. It was then investigated whether multimodal audiovisual and visuohaptic feedback are more effective for learning than visual feedback only. Naïve subjects (N = 24) trained in three groups on a highly realistic virtual reality-based rowing simulator. In the visual feedback group, the subject’s oar was superimposed to the target oar, which continuously became more transparent when the deviation between the oars decreased. Moreover, a trace of the subject’s trajectory emerged if deviations exceeded a threshold. The audiovisual feedback group trained with oar movement sonification in addition to visual feedback to facilitate learning of the velocity profile. In the visuohaptic group, the oar movement was inhibited by path deviation-dependent braking forces to enhance learning of spatial aspects. All groups significantly decreased the spatial error (tendency in visual group) and velocity error from baseline to the retention tests. Audiovisual feedback fostered learning of the velocity profile significantly more than visuohaptic feedback. The study revealed that well-designed concurrent feedback fosters complex task learning, especially if the advantages of different modalities are exploited. Further studies should analyze the impact of within-feedback design parameters and the transferability of the results to other tasks in sports and rehabilitation. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Augmented feedback; Haptic guidance; Movement sonification; Multimodal feedback; Robot-assisted learning; Rowing simulator,"adult; Article; auditory feedback; error; facilitation; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; normal human; perception; priority journal; rowing; tactile feedback; task performance; ultrasound; virtual reality; visual feedback; hearing; learning; motor performance; physiology; psychomotor performance; sensory feedback; touch; vision; young adult; Adult; Auditory Perception; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motor Skills; Psychomotor Performance; Touch Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925536399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a new set-up based on virtual-reality (VR) and haptic-robotics allowing us to induce sensorimotor adaptation and to reproduce the effect of prism adaptation in a more ecologically valid, yet experimentally controlled context. Participants were exposed to an immersive VR environment while controlling a virtual hand via a robotic-haptic device to reach virtual objects. During training, a rotational shift was induced between the position of the participant's real hand and that of the virtual hand in order to trigger sensorimotor recalibration. The use of VR and haptic-robotics allowed us to simulate and test multiple components of sensorimotor adaptation: training either peripersonal or extrapersonal space and testing generalization for the non-trained sector of space, and using active versus robot-guided reaching movements. Results from 60 neurologically intact participants show that participants exposed to the virtual shift were able to quickly adapt their reaching movements to aim correctly at the target objects. When the shift was removed, participants showed a systematic deviation of their movements during open-loop tasks in the direction opposite to that of the shift, which generalized to un-trained portions of space and occurred also when their movements were robotically-guided during the adaptation. Interestingly, follow-up questionnaires revealed that when the adaptation training was robotically-guided, participants were largely unaware of the mismatch between their hand and the virtual hand's position. The stability of the aftereffects, despite the changing experimental parameters, suggests that the induced sensory-motor adaptation does not rely on low-level processing of sensory stimuli during the training, but taps into high-level representations of space. Importantly, the flexibility of the trained space and the option of robotically-guided movements open novel possibilities of fine-tuning the training to patients’ level of spatial and motor impairment, thus possibly resulting in a better outcome. © 2020 The Author(s)",Far space; Guided movement; Haptic robot; Hemispatial neglect; Passive movement; Prism adaptation; Virtual reality,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098145308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sequential visual isometric pinch task ,,Transfer of motor skill between virtual reality viewed using a head-mounted display and conventional screen environments,"Background Virtual reality viewed using a head-mounted display (HMD-VR) has the potential to be a useful tool for motor learning and rehabilitation. However, when developing tools for these purposes, it is important to design applications that will effectively transfer to the real world. Therefore, it is essential to understand whether motor skills transfer between HMD-VR and conventional screen-based environments and what factors predict transfer. Methods We randomized 70 healthy participants into two groups. Both groups trained on a well-established measure of motor skill acquisition, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), either in HMD-VR or in a conventional environment (i.e., computer screen). We then tested whether the motor skills transferred from HMD-VR to the computer screen, and vice versa. After the completion of the experiment, participants responded to questions relating to their presence in their respective training environment, age, gender, video game use, and previous HMD-VR experience. Using multivariate and univariate linear regression, we then examined whether any personal factors from the questionnaires predicted individual differences in motor skill transfer between environments. Results Our results suggest that motor skill acquisition of this task occurs at the same rate in both HMD-VR and conventional screen environments. However, the motor skills acquired in HMD-VR did not transfer to the screen environment. While this decrease in motor skill performance when moving to the screen environment was not significantly predicted by self-reported factors, there were trends for correlations with presence and previous HMD-VR experience. Conversely, motor skills acquired in a conventional screen environment not only transferred but improved in HMD-VR, and this increase in motor skill performance could be predicted by self-reported factors of presence, gender, age and video game use. Conclusions These findings suggest that personal factors may predict who is likely to have better transfer of motor skill to and from HMD-VR. Future work should examine whether these and other predictors (i.e., additional personal factors such as immersive tendencies and task-specific factors such as fidelity or feedback) also apply to motor skill transfer from HMD-VR to more dynamic physical environments.",2391396610,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Juliano, Julia M;Sook-Lei Liew",,," © 2020.

ski-slalom or exercise/rehab games ,,Learning better by repetition or variation? Is transfer at odds with task specific training?,"Objective Transfer of motor skills is the ultimate goal of motor training in rehabilitation practice. In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Method One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6–10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. Results ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to. Conclusion Based on these findings, we conclude that motor skills acquired in the VR environment, transfers to real world contexts in similar proportions for both TD and DCD children. The type of practice adopted does not seem to influence children’s ability to transfer skills acquired in an exergame to life situations but the number of identical elements does.",1880542232,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bonney, Emmanuel;Lemke, Dorothee Jelsma;Ferguson, Gillian D;Bouwien C M Smits-Engelsman",,," © 2017 Bonney et al.

smartphone based maze game ,,Improvements in motor tasks through the use of smartphone technology for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"Background: In individuals severely affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), virtual reality has recently been used as a tool to enhance community interaction. Smartphones offer the exciting potential to improve communication, access, and participation, and present the unique opportunity to directly deliver functionality to people with disabilities. Objective: To verify whether individuals with DMD improve their motor performance when undertaking a visual motor task using a smartphone game. Patients and methods: Fifty individuals with DMD and 50 healthy, typically developing (TD) controls, aged 10–34 years participated in the study. The functional characterization of the sample was determined through Vignos, Egen Klassifikation, and the Motor Function Measure scales. To complete the task, individuals moved a virtual ball around a virtual maze and the time in seconds was measured after every attempt in order to analyze improvement of performance after the practice trials. Motor performance (time to finish each maze) was measured in phases of acquisition, short-term retention, and transfer. Results: Use of the smartphone maze game promoted improvement in performance during acquisition in both groups, which remained in the retention phase. At the transfer phases, with alternative maze tasks, the performance in DMD group was similar to the performance of TD group, with the exception of the transfer to the contralateral hand (nondominant). However, the group with DMD demonstrated longer movement time at all stages of learning, compared with the TD group. Conclusion: The practice of a visual motor task delivered via smartphone game promoted an improvement in performance with similar patterns of learning in both groups. Performance can be influenced by task difficulty, and for people with DMD, motor deficits are responsible for the lower speed of execution. This study indicates that individuals with DMD showed improved performance in a short-term motor learning protocol using a smartphone. We advocate that this technology could be used to promote function in this population.",2231011506,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Capelini, Camila Miliani;Talita Dias da Silva;Tonks, James;Watson, Suzanna;Mayra Priscila Boscolo Alvarez;Lilian Del Ciello de Menezes;Francis Meire Favero;Fátima Aparecida Caromano;Massetti, Thais;Carlos Bandeira de Mello Monteiro",,," © 2017.

Evidence has demonstrated that virtual environments can be useful therapeutic tools with demonstrated positive outcomes. The purpose of this pilot investigation was to determine the effects of virtual immersive sensorimotor training intervention by quantifying 1) the training effect measured via change in performance pre-to post-intervention on the virtual reality exercises, 2) the difference in the in clinical measures of functional sensorimotor control, 3) the injury incidence rate, and 4) on-field performance during soccer competitions. Statistical analyses were used to describe differences between an experimental and a control group. Participants were recruited from the men and women's soccer teams at two universities in the United States. Participants at one university were in the experimental group (n = 78) and received virtual immersive sensorimotor training, consisting of nine novel exercises in headset virtual reality, twice each week for six weeks. Participants at the second university were in the control group (n = 52). The virtual exercises were developed with reference to the rehabilitative principles of neuroplasticity to train various neurologic processes, contributing to overall sensorimotor control. This includes vestibular, visual and oculomotor activities, cervical neuromotor control training, movement coordination, and postural/balance exercises. The results indicate significant positive training effects pre-to post-intervention in seven of the nine training exercises (p ≤ 0.005) and improvement in clinical tests of cervical neuromotor control, balance, and inspection time (p ≤ 0.009) in the experimental group compared to the control. One of the virtual training exercises was positively associated with on-field performance (p = 0.022). No differences in injury rate or overall on-field performance metrics between the experimental and control were detected. This research study provides evidence of training and positive transfer from virtual to real-world environments, supporting the use of these novel virtual exercises to improve measures of sensorimotor control in healthy soccer athletes. © 2020 The Authors",Clinical research; Exercise; Musculoskeletal system; Neurology; Neuroscience; Sensorimotor control; Sports injury prevention; Virtual reality,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088391353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This training can be conducted in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR, VR) to enhance its effectiveness and speed. When the skills are transferred to the actual application, it is referred to as positive training transfer. However, thus far, it is unclear which training, AR or VR, achieves better results in terms of positive training transfer. We compare the effectiveness of AR and VR for spatial memory training in a control-room scenario, where users have to memorize the location of buttons and information displays in their surroundings. We conducted a within-subject study with 16 participants and evaluated the impact the training had on short-Term and long-Term memory. Results of our study show that VR outperformed AR when tested in the same medium after the training. In a memory transfer test conducted two days later AR outperformed VR. Our findings have implications on the design of future training scenarios and applications. © 2018 IEEE.",and virtual realities; augmented; Evaluation/methodology; H.5.1-Information Interfaces and Presentation: Multimedia Information Systems-Artificial; H.5.2-Information Interfaces and Presentation: Multimedia Information Systems-Ergonomics; Theory and methods,E-learning; Ergonomics; Information systems; Information use; Virtual reality; augmented; Evaluation/methodology; MultiMedia Information Systems; Multimedia information systems-artificial; Theory and methods; User interfaces,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053846424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

University Blvd., Tucson, AZ  85719, United States","Past studies suggest that learning a spatial environment by navigating on a desktop computer can lead to significant acquisition of spatial knowledge, although typically less than navigating in the real world. Exactly how this might differ when learning in immersive virtual interfaces that offer a rich set of multisensory cues remains to be fully explored. In this study, participants learned a campus building environment by navigating (1) the real-world version, (2) an immersive version involving an omnidirectional treadmill and head-mounted display, or (3) a version navigated on a desktop computer with a mouse and a keyboard. Participants first navigated the building in one of the three different interfaces and, afterward, navigated the real-world building to assess information transfer. To determine how well they learned the spatial layout, we measured path length, visitation errors, and pointing errors. Both virtual conditions resulted in significant learning and transfer to the real world, suggesting their efficacy in mimicking some aspects of real-world navigation. Overall, real-world navigation outperformed both immersive and desktop navigation, effects particularly pronounced early in learning. This was also suggested in a second experiment involving transfer from the real world to immersive virtual reality (VR). Analysis of effect sizes of going from virtual conditions to the real world suggested a slight advantage for immersive VR compared to desktop in terms of transfer, although at the cost of increased likelihood of dropout. Our findings suggest that virtual navigation results in significant learning, regardless of the interface, with immersive VR providing some advantage when transferring to the real world.

This chapter provides a synopsis of existing knowledge about transfer in sport, with the view that such a synopsis might generate ideas for further scientific inquiry, as well as helping to guide coach and player development. Transfer is discussed in terms of the following discriminators of expert performance in sport: anticipation; pattern recall; pattern recognition; and decision making. The chapter defines anticipation as the capability to use visual information in the immediate environment to predict what will occur in order to achieve the motor skill goal. It discusses empirical evidence of transfer within sports relative to performance and learning, encompassing video simulation, virtual reality, or in situ methodologies. The chapter also discusses empirical evidence of transfer between sports and, in particular, in regard to the sampling of sports. It describes theories of transfer and studies that have attempted to test theoretical predictions. The chapter suggests practical applications for practitioners based upon theory and empirical findings. It outlines future research directions that require focussed investigation to advance understanding of transfer, which, in turn, can help advance what is known in the field of sport expertise and skill learning.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Obstacle crossing, such as stepping over a curb, becomes more challenging with natural aging and could lead to obstacle-related trips and falls. To reduce fall-risk, obstacle training programs using physical obstacles have been developed, but come with space and human resource constraints. These barriers could be removed by using a virtual obstacle crossing training program, but only if the learned gait characteristics transfer to a real environment. We examined whether virtual environment obstacle crossing behavior is transferred to crossing real environment obstacles. Forty participants (n = 20 younger adults and n = 20 older adults) completed two sessions of virtual environment obstacle crossing, which was preceded and followed by one session of real environment obstacle crossing. Participants learned to cross the virtual obstacle more safely and that change in behavior was transferred to the real environment via increased foot clearance and alterations in foot placement before and after the real environment obstacle. Further, while both age groups showed transfer to the real environment task, they differed on the limb in which their transfer effects applied. This suggests it is plausible to use virtual reality training to enhance gait characteristics in the context of obstacle avoidance, potentially leading to a novel way to reduce fall-risk.

This study examined adaptation in gait stability and its interlimb transfer in a virtual obstacle avoidance task. Twelve young adults walked on a treadmill while wearing a virtual reality headset with their body state represented in the virtual environment. At random times, but always at foot touchdown, 50 virtual obstacles of constant size appeared 0.8 m in front of the participant requiring a step over with the right leg. Early, mid and late adaptation phases were investigated by pooling data from trials 1–3, 24–26 and 48–50. One left-leg obstacle appearing after 50 right-leg trials was used to investigate interlimb transfer. Toe clearance and the anteroposterior margin of stability (MoS) at foot touchdown were calculated for the stepping leg. Toe clearance decreased over repeated practice between early and late phases from 0.13 ± 0.05 m to 0.09 ± 0.04 m (mean ± SD, p < 0.05). MoS increased from 0.05 ± 0.02 m to 0.08 ± 0.02 m (p < 0.05) between early and late phases, with no significant differences between mid and late phases. No differences were found in toe clearance and MoS between the practiced right leg for early phase and the single trial of the left leg. Obstacle avoidance during walking in a virtual environment stimulated adaptive gait improvements that were related in a nonlinear manner to practice dose, though such gait adaptations seemed to be limited in their transferability between limbs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Falls; Gait stability; Motor adaptation; Motor transfer; Obstacle avoidance,Virtual reality; Constant sizes; Fall; Gait stabilities; Motor adaptation; Motor transfers; Obstacles avoidance; Toe clearances; Virtual obstacle; Virtual-reality headsets; Young adults; Collision avoidance,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102344941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the addition of virtual reality (VR) training could further improve muscle strength, mood state, and functional status for patients with acute stroke is unknown. Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of VR training on muscle strength, mood state (depression, anxiety), and functional status in patients following acute stroke. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with acute ischemic stroke (N = 152) were selected and randomly assigned with a 1:3 randomization ratio to either experimental group (EG) or comparison group (CG). Both groups received early rehabilitation. The EG received an extra 5 days of VR training (15 min of time, two times a day), started 24 hr to 3 days poststroke. Muscle strength, mood state, and functional status were collected at admission and at the day of discharge. Generalized estimating equations were applied to examine the intervention effects. Results: A total of 143 participants (94%) completed the study, and 145 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Participants in the EG reported increased muscle strength of upper and lower limbs in both affected and unaffected sides, decreased depression and anxiety, and increased functional status at discharge. When the group–time interaction was examined, the EG had greater increased upper limb muscle strength of the unaffected side (ß = 0.34, p <.001) and decreased depression and anxiety scores (ß = −2.31, p =.011; ß = −1.63, p =.047) at discharge compared with the CG. However, there was no difference in the functional status change scores from baseline between EG and CG. Linking Evidence to Action: A poststroke program that includes both early rehabilitation and VR training has greater benefit in relation to mood state and muscle strength at discharge than early rehabilitation alone. Therefore, an early physical rehabilitation program that includes VR training for acute stroke inpatients should be considered for implementation in clinical settings. © 2020 Sigma Theta Tau International",anxiety; depression; early rehabilitation; functional status; mood state; muscle strength; stroke; virtual reality training,affect; aged; cerebrovascular accident; complication; controlled study; convalescence; female; functional status; human; male; middle aged; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; stroke rehabilitation; time factor; treatment outcome; virtual reality exposure therapy; Affect; Aged; Female; Functional Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Recovery of Function; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082185856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of teaching intracorporeal knot tying (ICKT) by VR simulation only. Methods: Twenty novices underwent structured training of basic skills training on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer simulator (Mentice AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) followed by knot tying training on the LapSim simulator (Surgical Science, Gothenburg, Sweden). They were assessed pre- and post-training on a video trainer. Assessment of performance included motion tracking and video-based checklist. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used, and P < .05 was deemed significant. Results: All participants completed a correct knot as compared with only 25% before VR training. Time to completion was 66% faster and knot quality 45% better after VR training. Significant reduction in number of movements (P = .006) and distance traveled (P < .000) by both hands after VR training. Conclusions: Teaching ICKT by VR simulators only is feasible and effective.

Background A key assumption of VR training is that the learned skills and experiences transfer to the real world. Yet, in certain application areas, such as VR sports training, the research testing this assumption is sparse. Design Real-world table tennis performance was assessed using a mixed-model analysis of variance. The analysis comprised a between-subjects (VR training group vs control group) and a within-subjects (pre- and post-training) factor. Method Fifty-seven participants (23 females) were either assigned to a VR training group (n = 29) or no-training control group (n = 28). During VR training, participants were immersed in competitive table tennis matches against an artificial intelligence opponent. An expert table tennis coach evaluated participants on real-world table tennis playing before and after the training phase. Blinded regarding participant's group assignment, the expert assessed participants' backhand, forehand and serving on quantitative aspects (e.g. count of rallies without errors) and quality of skill aspects (e.g. technique and consistency). Results VR training significantly improved participants' real-world table tennis performance compared to a no-training control group in both quantitative (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.08) and quality of skill assessments (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.10).

For VR training to effectively simulate real-world tennis performance, it must recreate the contextual information and movement behaviours present in the real-world environment. It is therefore critical to assess the representativeness of VR prior to implementing skill training interventions. We constructed a VR tennis environment designed for training perceptual-cognitive skill, with the aim of assessing its representativeness and validating its use. Participants movement behaviours were compared when playing tennis in VR and real-world environments. When performing groundstrokes, participants frequently used the same stance in VR as they did in the real-world condition. Participants experienced a high sense of presence in VR, evident through the factors of spatial presence, engagement and ecological validity being high, with minimal negative effects found. We conclude that Tennis VR is sufficiently representative of real-world tennis. Our discussion focuses on the opportunity for training perceptual-cognitive skill and the potential for skill transfer. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",artificial intelligence; interactive training; perception action coupling; Skill,adult; article; artificial intelligence; ecological validity; female; human; human experiment; male; perception; simulation training; skill; standing; tennis; virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091186202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This risk is due to deficits in posterior chain and hip recruitment associated with aberrant frontal knee loads. The identification of these risk factors has led to targeted neuromuscular training (NMT) interventions to enhance hip neuromuscular control during such tasks. Despite the successful modification of ACL injury risk factors following NMT, the transfer of these corrected movement patterns to the sport-specific contexts has not been directly evaluated. Sport-specific virtual reality (VR) may provide the best method to measure training transfer to realistic sport performance, while still allowing appropriate experimental control and high-fidelity performance measurements. The current study examined the effect of a biofeedback-driven augmented NMT (aNMT) on skill transfer of ACL-injury resistant movement patterns during performance of sport-specific VR scenarios. Five trained athletes participated, and their performance on an unanticipated cutting task was assessed in VR prior to and after six weeks of aNMT. A significant 87% reduction in internal hip rotation was observed on the plant leg during the loading phase of cutting (p =.05), along with an observed 116% reduction during the push-off phase (p =.02), from pre-to post-training. A non-significant trend of a 19% reduction in knee abduction was also observed (p =.15). This study is the first that has utilized free ambulatory wireless VR to assess injury risk in athletes during performance of sport-specific tasks. The reduction in internal hip rotation and knee abduction align with previous findings on laboratory based tests. The current results are the first step in the validation of sport-specific VR as a tool for understanding injury risk during simulation of real-world sport performance. © 2017 IEEE.",anterior cruciate ligament; cutting; soccer; sport; virtual reality,Biofeedback; Cutting; Health risks; Risk assessment; Virtual reality; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Competitive sports; Experimental control; Neuromuscular control; Performance measurements; soccer; Sport performance; Sports,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034266510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

typing ,,Text Entry in Immersive Head-Mounted Display-based Virtual Reality using Standard Keyboards,"We study the performance and user experience of two popular mainstream text entry devices, desktop keyboards and touchscreen keyboards, for use in Virtual Reality (VR) applications. We discuss the limitations arising from limited visual feedback, and examine the efficiency of different strategies of use. We analyze a total of 24 hours of typing data in VR from 24 participants and find that novice users are able to retain about 60% of their typing speed on a desktop keyboard and about 40-45\% of their typing speed on a touchscreen keyboard. We also find no significant learning effects, indicating that users can transfer their typing skills fast into VR. Besides investigating baseline performances, we study the position in which keyboards and hands are rendered in space. We find that this does not adversely affect performance for desktop keyboard typing and results in a performance trade-off for touchscreen keyboard typing.",2071304978,,,Working Papers,,"Grubert, Jens;Witzani, Lukas;Ofek, Eyal;Pahud, Michel;Kranz, Matthias;Kristensson, Per Ola",,," © 2018.

However, there is a lack in the evidences about the transfer's potential of the gains obtained in the VR to real environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the transfer of gains obtained through training in VR to motor function of the PUL tested in real environment (RE) in individuals with chronic sequels of stroke (CSS). Participants: Twenty-two patients with chronic sequels of stroke with a mean age of 66.4 ±7.14 years, 15 men and 7 women, mean time post stroke, 4.1± 5.14 years; 13 with left hemiparesis. Interventions: Three sessions of training in VR using four games of the Nintendo Wii (NW) that elicited large and fast upper limb movements. Main outcome measures: Goniometric measures were used as the main outcome to evaluate the transfer of gain to range of motion. As well as a computerizing test was used to evaluate the transfer of gains to movement velocity. Additionally, the scores obtained from the patients in the four games were also used as measure of learning. All measures were evaluated in two assessment time points: baseline (BA) and at end of study (EA). Results: The ANOVA for repeated measure showed that there were statistically significant improvements for all trained games and transfer tests (range of motion and movement velocity). Conclusions: Patients with CSS were able to transfer the gains obtained in the VR to motor function, specifically in range of motion and movement velocity in the PUL. © 2015 ACM.",Rehabilitation; Stroke; Upper limb; Virtual reality exposure therapy,E-learning; Function evaluation; Interactive computer graphics; Virtual reality; Motor function; Outcome measures; Range of motions; Real environments; Repeated measures; Stroke; Upper limbs; Virtual reality exposure therapies; Patient rehabilitation,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959293287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality is a frequently used tool in vocational training. Nevertheless, its efficiency has not been systematically tested. The main goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a virtual environment (VE) for learning a complex procedure in the biomedical domain. Two experiments were performed. The first one assessed internal validity of the VE, which is the effectiveness of using a VE in the process of learning a new procedure. The second one tested external validity of the VE, which is the participants' ability to reproduce the acquired skills in a real context. We find that internal and external validity must be evaluated before using a virtual environment in long-term procedure learning. The results of such evaluations are a basis for future experiments aiming to optimize learning conditions in a VE and transferring the acquired skills in a real context.

Yet how it induces performance gains of interlimb coordination in the bimanual movements between trained limb and the opposite, untrained limb is unclear. The present study designed a game-like interactive system for physical practice, in which an avatar's hands could be controlled itself or by the subject during a bimanual movement task in an immersive virtual reality environment. Participants practiced with the bimanual task by simultaneously drawing non-symmetric three-sided squares (e.g., U and C) to learn limb coordination with the following training strategies: (1) performing and seeing a bimanual task (BH-BH); (2) performing a unimanual task with right hand and seeing a bimanual action (RH-BH); (3) not performing a task but seeing a bimanual action (noH-BH); (4) performing and seeing a unimanual task (RH-RH). We found that the learning performance was better after BH-BH and RH-BH compared with other training strategies. In addition, we examined the effects of virtual hand representations on the learning performance after RH-BH. We found that the performance after training was increased with the realism level of virtual hands. These findings suggest that the proposed approach of RH-BH with realistic virtual hand would result in transfer of coordination skill to the unpracticed hand, which puts forward a new approach for learning and rehabilitation of coordination skill in patients with unilateral motor deficit in immersive environments. © 2020 IEEE.",Avatar hands; bimanual movement; coordination skill; virtual reality,Patient rehabilitation; Transfer learning; User interfaces; Bimanual movement; Co-ordination skills; Immersive environment; Immersive virtual reality; Interactive system; Learning performance; Performance Gain; Training strategy; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085471846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on simulation show skills learned in VR can be successfully transferred to a real-world task. Recently, with improvements in technology, VR simulators have been developed to allow complex medical procedures to be practiced without risking the patient.Method: Three studies are reported. In Study 1, 35 consultant interventional radiologists took part in a cognitive task analysis to empirically establish the key competencies of the Seldinger procedure. In Study 2, 62 participants performed one simulated procedure, and their performance was compared by expertise. In Study 3, the transferability of simulator training to a real-world procedure was assessed with 14 trainees.Results: Study 1 produced 23 key competencies that were implemented as performance measures in the simulator. Study 2 showed the simulator had both face and construct validity, although some issues were identified. Study 3 showed the group that had undergone simulator training received significantly higher mean performance ratings on a subsequent patient procedure.Conclusion: The findings of this study support the centrality of validation in the successful design of simulators and show the utility of simulators as a training device.Application: The studies show the key elements of a validation program for a simulator. In addition to task analysis and face and construct validities, the authors highlight the importance of transfer of training in validation studies. © 2011 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",interventional radiology; simulation; training; validation; virtual reality,"Cognitive task analysis; Construct validity; Interventional; Interventional radiology; Interventional radiology training; Key elements; Medical procedures; Performance measure; Performance ratings; Real-world task; simulation; Simulator training; Skill acquisition; Task analysis; validation; Validation Program; Validation study; Virtual reality simulator; Human engineering; Job analysis; Personnel training; Radiation; Radiology; Virtual reality; Simulators; adult; article; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; human; interventional radiology; reproducibility; task performance; teaching; Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Humans; Radiology, Interventional; Reproducibility of Results; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82055170541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the central nervous system builds and maintains internal representations of such skilled hand-object interactions has attracted significant attention over the past three decades. Nevertheless, two major gaps exist: a) how digit positions and forces are coordinated during natural manipulation tasks, and b) what mechanisms underlie the formation and retention of internal representations of dexterous manipulation. This dissertation addresses these two questions through five experiments that are based on novel grip devices and experimental protocols. It was found that high-level representation of manipulation tasks can be learned in an effector-independent fashion. Specifically, when challenged by trial-to-trial variability in finger positions or using digits that were not previously engaged in learning the task, subjects could adjust finger forces to compensate for this variability, thus leading to consistent task performance. The results from a follow-up experiment conducted in a virtual reality environment indicate that haptic feedback is sufficient to implement the above coordination between digit position and forces. However, it was also found that the generalizability of a learned manipulation is limited across tasks. Specifically, when subjects learned to manipulate the same object across different contexts that require different motor output, interference was found at the time of switching contexts. Data from additional studies provide evidence for parallel learning processes, which are characterized by different rates of decay and learning. These experiments have provided important insight into the neural mechanisms underlying learning and control of object manipulation. The present findings have potential biomedical applications including brain-machine interfaces, rehabilitation of hand function, and prosthetics.

The VE system is intended for application in clinical assessment and rehabilitation of the elderly with CNS dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. The VE Laboratory at the University of Southern California has developed a suite of ImmersaDesk-format, 3-dimensional (3D) projection-based VEs, with scenarios targeting assessment of visuospatial skills, including visual field-specific reaction time (RT), depth perception, 3D field dependency (virtual rod and frame test), static and dynamic manual target tracking in 3D space, and spatial rotation. Ss were administered a standard neuropsychological battery and a suite of VE-delivered visuospatial tasks. Issues addressed include VE-related side effects; the relationship between performance on VE measures and standard neuropsychological tests; gender-specific performance differences; the relationship between immersive tendencies, presence ratings and VE performance; learning and generalization; and VE visuospatial performance differences between younger and older Ss.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined whether the human motor system uses a modular decomposition strategy to learn the visuomotor map, the relationship between visual inputs and motor outputs. A learning paradigm was investigated in which the visual feedback of the hand was perturbed during pointing movements so that a single location in visual space was remapped to 2 different hand positions depending on the starting location of the movement. 32 Ss were exposed in a virtual reality setup to 2 different visuomotor perturbations. Despite the conflicting pairing between visual and motor space, Ss learned the 2 starting-point-dependent visuomotor mappings, and the generalization of this learning to intermediate starting locations demonstrated an interpolation of the 2 learned maps. Results provide evidence that the brain may use a modular decomposition strategy during learning.

Evidence suggests visuomotor learning deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the exact nature of these deficits and the ability of dopamine medication to improve them are under-explored. Previous studies suggested that learning driven by large and small movement errors engaged distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether PD patients have a generalized impairment in visuomotor learning or selective deficits in learning from large explicit errors which engages cognitive strategies or small imperceptible movement errors involving primarily implicit learning processes. Visuomotor learning skills of non-medicated and medicated patients were assessed in two reaching tasks in which the size of visuospatial errors experienced during learning was manipulated using a novel three-dimensional virtual reality environment. In the explicit perturbation task, the visuomotor perturbation was applied suddenly resulting in large consciously detected initial spatial errors, whereas in the implicit perturbation task, the perturbation was gradually introduced in small undetectable steps such that subjects never experienced large movement errors. A major finding of this study was that PD patients in non-medicated and medicated conditions displayed slower learning rates and smaller adaptation magnitudes than healthy subjects in the explicit perturbation task, but performance similar to healthy controls in the implicit perturbation task. Also, non-medicated patients showed an average reduced deadaptation relative to healthy controls when exposed to the large errors produced by the sudden removal of the perturbation in both the explicit and implicit perturbation tasks. Although dopaminergic medication consistently improved motor signs, it produced a variable impact on learning the explicit perturbation and deadaptation and unexpectedly worsened performance in some patients. Considered together, these results indicate that PD selectively impairs the ability to learn from large consciously detected visuospatial errors. This finding suggests that basal ganglia-related circuits are important neural structures for adaptation to sudden perturbations requiring awareness and high-cost action selection. Dopaminergic treatment may selectively compromise the ability to learn from large explicit movement errors for reasons that remain to be elucidated. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",3D reaching movements; Basal ganglia; Virtual reality; Visuomotor learning,"dopamine receptor stimulating agent; adaptation; adult; aged; article; clinical article; depth perception; dopaminergic activity; drug mechanism; drug targeting; female; human; learning; male; motor performance; Parkinson disease; priority journal; psychomotor performance; stimulus response; task performance; virtual reality exposure therapy; visual adaptation; visual stimulation; visuomotor adaptation; visuomotor coordination; Adaptation, Physiological; Aged; Antiparkinson Agents; Biomechanics; Cognition; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson Disease; Psychomotor Performance",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872252190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we report on the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of using the VR augmented cycling kit to improve cardiorespiratory (CR) fitness of individuals in the chronic phase poststroke. METHODS:: Four individuals with chronic stroke (47-65 years old and ≥3 years poststroke), with residual lower extremity impairments (Fugl-Meyer 24-26/34), who were limited community ambulators (gait speed range 0.56-1.1 m/s) participated in this study. Safety was defined as the absence of adverse events. Feasibility was measured using attendance, total exercise time, and ""involvement"" measured with the presence questionnaire (PQ). Efficacy of CR fitness was evaluated using a submaximal bicycle ergometer test before and after an 8-week training program. RESULTS:: The intervention was safe and feasible with participants having 1 adverse event, 100% adherence, achieving between 90 and 125 minutes of cycling each week, and a mean PQ score of 39 (SD 3.3). There was a statistically significant (13%; P = 0.035) improvement in peak VO2, with a range of 6% to 24.5%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:: For these individuals, poststroke, VR augmented cycling, using their heart rate to set their avatarÊs speed, fostered training of sufficient duration and intensity to promote CR fitness. In addition, there was a transfer of training from the bicycle to walking endurance. VR augmented cycling may be an addition to the therapistÊs tools for concurrent training of mobility and health promotion of individuals poststroke.

Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Immersive virtual reality can expose humans to novel training and sensory environments, but motor training with virtual reality has not been able to improve motor performance as much as motor training in real-world conditions. An advantage of immersive virtual reality that has not been fully leveraged is that it can introduce transient visual perturbations on top of the visual environment being displayed. The goal of this study was to determine whether transient visual perturbations introduced in immersive virtual reality modify electrocortical activity and behavioral outcomes in human subjects practicing a novel balancing task during walking. We studied three groups of healthy young adults (5 male and 5 female for each) while they learned a balance beam walking task for 30 min under different conditions. Two groups trained while wearing a virtual reality headset, and one of those groups also had half-second visual rotation perturbations lasting ~10% of the training time. The third group trained without virtual reality. We recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and movement kinematics. We hypothesized that virtual reality training with perturbations would increase electrocortical activity and improve balance performance compared with virtual reality training without perturbations. Our results confirmed the hypothesis. Brief visual perturbations induced increased theta spectral power and decreased alpha spectral power in parietal and occipital regions and improved balance performance in posttesting. Our findings indicate that transient visual perturbations during immersive virtual reality training can boost short-term motor learning by inducing a cognitive change, minimizing the negative effects of virtual reality on motor training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that transient visual perturbations in virtual reality during balance training can boost short-term motor learning by inducing a cognitive change, overcoming the negative effects of immersive virtual reality. As a result, subjects training in immersive virtual reality with visual perturbations have equivalent performance improvement as training in real-world conditions. Visual perturbations elicited cortical responses in occipital and parietal regions and may have improved the brain’s ability to adapt to variations in sensory input. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

Adaptation may require the use of visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory environment and back, as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight, the prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our previous paper, we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however, larger overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects, in the absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback, are believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because, in the absence of relevant external dynamic cues such as optic flow, reliance on body-based cues is enhanced during gait tasks through multisensory integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of optic flow on tactile-stimulated split-belt adaptation as a paradigm to facilitate the sensorimotor adaptation process. Twenty healthy young adults, separated into two matched groups, participated in the study. All participants performed an overground walking trial followed by a split-belt treadmill adaptation protocol. The tactile group (TC) received vibratory plantar tactile stimulation only, whereas the virtual reality and tactile group (VRT) received an additional concurrent visual stimulation: a moving virtual corridor, inducing perceived self-motion. A post-treadmill overground trial was performed to determine adaptation transfer. Interlimb coordination of spatiotemporal and kinetic variables was quantified using symmetry indices and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Marked changes of step length characteristics were observed in both groups during split-belt adaptation. Stance and swing time symmetries were similar in the two groups, suggesting that temporal parameters are not modified by optic flow. However, whereas the TC group displayed significant stance time asymmetries during the post-treadmill session, such aftereffects were absent in the VRT group. The results indicated that the enhanced transfer resulting from exposure to plantar cutaneous vibration during adaptation was alleviated by optic flow information. The presence of visual self-motion information may have reduced proprioceptive gain during learning. Thus, during overground walking, the learned proprioceptive split-belt pattern is more rapidly overridden by visual input due to its increased relative gain. The results suggest that when visual stimulation is provided during adaptive training, the system acquires the novel movement dynamics while maintaining the ability to flexibly adapt to different environments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Biomechanics; Gait; Motor control; Motor learning; Sensory; Vibration; Virtual reality,"adaptation; adult; Article; association; environmental factor; female; gait; human; human experiment; learning; locomotion; male; motor control; normal human; optic flow; priority journal; proprioception; sensorimotor integration; standing; tactile feedback; tactile stimulation; task performance; training; treadmill test; vibration sense; virtual reality; visual feedback; visual stimulation; visuomotor coordination; adaptation; exercise test; motor activity; optic flow; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; spatial behavior; time factor; touch; young adult; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Optic Flow; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Spatial Behavior; Time Factors; Touch; Young Adult",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955637735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though full rotation is no longer a technical challenge, physical translation is still restricted through limited tracked areas. While rotational information has been shown to be important, the benefit of the translational component is still unclear with mixed results in previous work. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-method experiment to compare four levels of translational cues and control: none (using the trackpad of the HTC Vive controller to translate), upper-body leaning (sitting on a 'NaviChair', leaning the upper-body to locomote), whole-body leaning/stepping (standing on a platform called NaviBoard, leaning the whole body or stepping one foot off the center to navigate), and full translation (physically walking). Results showed that translational cues and control had significant effects on various measures including task performance, task load, and simulator sickness. While participants performed significantly worse when they used a controller with no embodied translational cues, there was no significant difference between the NaviChair, NaviBoard, and actual walking. These results suggest that translational body-based motion cues and control from a low-cost leaning/stepping interface might provide enough sensory information for supporting spatial updating, spatial awareness, and efficient locomotion in VR, although future work will need to investigate how these results might or might not generalize to other tasks and scenarios. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Adaptive control; cognitive informatics; human computer interaction; human factors; user interface; virtual reality,Computer graphics; Software engineering; Efficient locomotion; Sensory information; Simulator sickness; Spatial awareness; Spatial updating; Technical challenges; Translational component; Virtual locomotion; Controllers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096885584,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, results so far are conflicting potentially due to the lack of challenge imposed by the movements in those games. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess to which extent two similar skiing games challenge balance, as reflected in center of mass (COM) movements relative to their Functional Limits of Stability (FLOS). Methods Thirty young and elderly participants performed two skiing games, one on the Wii Balance board (Wiiski), which uses a force plate, and one with the Kinect sensor (Kinski), which performs motion tracking. During gameplay, kinematics were captured using seven opto-electronical cameras. FLOS were obtained for eight directions. The influence of games and trials on COM displacement in each of the eight directions, and maximal COM speed, were tested with Generalized Estimated Equations. Results In all directions with anterior and medio-lateral, but not with a posterior component, subjects showed significantly larger maximal %FLOS displacements during the Kinski game than during the Wiiski game. Furthermore, maximal COM displacement, and COM speed in Kinski remained similar or increased over trials, whereas for Wiiski it decreased. Conclusions Our results show the importance of assessing the movement challenge in games used for balance training. Similar games impose different challenges, with the control sensors and their gain settings playing an important role. Furthermore, adaptations led to a decrease in challenge in Wiiski, which might limit the effectiveness of the game as a balance-training tool. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Aging; Balance; Balance training; Elderly; Virtual reality,adult; aged; Article; body equilibrium; camera; data analysis software; electronics; female; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; motion analysis system; movement (physiology); priority journal; scoring system; skiing; virtual reality; adolescent; biomechanics; body equilibrium; kinesiotherapy; physiology; procedures; skiing; video game; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Postural Balance; Skiing; Video Games; Virtual Reality; Young Adult,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030858846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An experiment evaluated the application of virtual fixtures as an aid for guiding a user in a path navigation task. The task was performed with or without force field guidance of virtual fixtures, and then transferred to the condition with no virtual fixtures. Results showed significant learning and transfer effects measured by performance time and path length. However, training using virtual fixtures with force guidance had comparable results to training with graphic only fixtures representing the path.

In a 2 × 2 experiment design, we investigated a large-screen immersive display (LSID) with a head-mounted display (HMD), and the presence versus absence of gravity. Advantages of the HMD include interacting with the simulation in a more natural manner as compared to using a large-screen immersive display due to the similarities between the interactions afforded in the virtual compared to the real-world task. Suspending the laws of physics may have an effect on usability and in turn could affect learning outcomes. Our dependent variables consisted of a pre and post cognition questionnaire, quantitative performance measures, perceived workload and system usefulness, and a psychomotor assessment to measure to what extent transfer of learning took place from the virtual to the real world. Results indicate that the HMD condition was preferable to the immersive display in several metrics while the no-gravity condition resulted in users adopting strategies that were not advantageous for task performance. © 2017 IEEE.",and virtual realities; augmented; H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems - Artificial,Personnel training; Units of measurement; User interfaces; Virtual reality; augmented; Dependent variables; H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems - Artificial; Head mounted displays; Large-screen immersive displays; Simulation fidelity; Training simulation; Transfer of learning; Helmet mounted displays,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019003187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

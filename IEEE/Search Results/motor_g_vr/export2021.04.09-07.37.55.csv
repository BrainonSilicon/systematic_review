Current RL algorithms generally work for the tasks with immediate rewards delivery, and lack of efficiency in delayed reward task. Prefrontal cortex, including medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), has been demonstrated to assign credit to intermediate steps, which reinforces preceding action more efficiently. In this paper, we propose to simulate the functionality of mPFC activities as intermediate rewards to train a RL based decoder in a two-step movement task. A support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to verify if the subject expects a reward due to the accomplishment of a subtask from mPFC activity. Then this discrimination result will be utilized to guide the training of the RL decoder for each step respectively. Here, we apply the Sarsa-style attention-gated reinforcement learning (SAGREL) as the decoder to interpret motor cortex(M1) activity to action states. We test on in vivo primary motor cortex (M1) and mPFC data collected from rats, where the rats need to first trigger the start and then press lever for rewards using M1 signals. SAGREL using intermediate rewards from mPFC activities achieves a prediction accuracy of 66.8% ± 2.0.% (mean ± std) %, which is significantly better than the one using the reward by the end of trial (45.9.% ± 1.2%). This reveals the potentials of modelling mPFC activities as intermediate rewards for the delayed reward tasks.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175964","","Task analysis;Decoding;Rats;Support vector machines;Presses;Firing;Learning (artificial intelligence)","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;support vector machines","movement intentions;brain-machine interfaces;delayed reward task;mPFC activity;intermediate rewards;RL based decoder;two-step movement task;support vector machine;Sarsa-style attention-gated reinforcement learning;internal reward;time delayed task;in vivo primary motor cortex","Animals;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Learning;Prefrontal Cortex;Rats;Reinforcement, Psychology;Reward","","","14","","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Guidance of general human behavior by expert navigation is expected to be realized through the development of wearable computing. We aim to apply this technology to first-aid treatment. If an injured or ill person requires first-aid treatment but only non-experts are nearby, guidance from an expert at a remote site would be necessary. We focus on the sharing of visual information between a first-aid expert at a remote critical care center and a non-expert at the patient's location. Visual information about the remote site is captured by a head-mounted camera worn by the assistant and is shared with the expert, thus providing rich information on the status of the patient, the environment and the situation. In a typical master-slave configuration, the shared visual information is tightly linked between the expert and the assistant; that is, the assistant views what the expert wants to see. However, a tight link or synchronization is required only in certain situations, rather than at all times. The aim of this research is to develop a virtual viewing direction operation system with image stabilization for asynchronous visual information sharing between an expert and an assistant. The proposed system consists of three main parts: image stabilization, virtual viewing direction operation and the relative orientation display. The effectiveness of the developed system was confirmed experimentally.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-7990-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598662","","Cameras;Visualization;Lenses;Motion compensation;Pixel;Robot sensing systems","image processing;virtual reality","virtual viewing direction operation system;image stabilization;asynchronous visual information sharing;computers;sensors;motors;wearable computing;human behavior;first-aid treatment;remote critical care center;head-mounted camera;master-slave configuration;relative orientation display","","2","","20","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our previous work [1], an optimal design of BMIs based on artificial sensory feedback was developed using model predictive control which relied on neuronal activity in the form of spiking. From a real implementation perspective, a more generalized framework that utilizes spiking is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a charge-balanced intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS) current and a network of spiking neurons are adopted to compensate the lost feedback information. Next, an artificial sensory feedback framework using the network of spiking neurons is designed based on model predictive control (MPC) strategy, and an optimization problem is formulated according to this framework. Since the charge-balanced ICMS current is composed of several integer parameters, the optimization problem also includes some integer decision variables and is hard to be solved. In this paper, a heuristic population-based search algorithm called particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve this optimization problem. Considering the updated particles may violate the input constraints, additional constraints are designed to guarantee that the decision variables can satisfy the input constraints. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the designed closed-loop BMIs during recovery of natural performance.","2378-5861","978-1-4799-8684-2","10.1109/ACC.2015.7171117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7171117","","Neurons;Optimization;Decoding;Trajectory;Algorithm design and analysis;Integrated circuit modeling;Joints","brain-computer interfaces;closed loop systems;feedback;neurophysiology;optimal control;particle swarm optimisation;predictive control;search problems","closed-loop brain-machine interfaces;MPC strategy;human-machine integration systems;cortical neuronal activity;impaired motor tasks restoration;optimal design;artificial sensory feedback;model predictive control;charge-balanced intra-cortical microstimulation;spiking neurons;feedback information;optimization problem;charge-balanced ICMS current;integer parameters;integer decision variables;heuristic population-based search algorithm;particle swarm optimization;PSO algorithm;input constraints;closed-loop BMI","","","","22","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The time-varying parametric modeling approach employs a nonlinear autoregressive with external input model, whose parameters are approximated by a set of multi-wavelet basis functions. A regularized orthogonal least squares (ROLS) algorithm is then used to produce a parsimonious or sparse regression model and estimate the associated model parameters. The time-varying Granger causality between nonstationary signals can be detected accurately by making use of both the good approximation properties of multi-wavelets and the good generalization performance of the ROLS in the presence of high-level noise. Two simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear causal detection respectively. The proposed method is then applied to real EEG signals of MI tasks. It follows that transient causal information flow over the time course between various sensorimotor related channels can be successfully revealed during the whole reaction processes. Experimental results from these case studies confirm the applicability of the proposed scheme and show its utility for the understanding of the associated neural mechanism and the potential significance for developing MI tasks based brain-computer interface systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2818789","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Natural Science Foundation; Open Fund Project of the Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory, Minjiang University; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; EPSRC Platform Programme, U.K.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325452","Granger causality;nonlinear time-varying systems;parametric estimation;multi-wavelets;regularized orthogonal least squares (ROLS);EEG","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Time-varying systems;Transient analysis;Task analysis;Autoregressive processes;Analytical models","autoregressive processes;brain-computer interfaces;causality;electroencephalography;least squares approximations;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;regression analysis;time-varying systems;wavelet transforms","EEG signals;motor imagery tasks;time-varying parametric modeling approach;external input model;regularized orthogonal least squares algorithm;ROLS;parsimonious regression model;sparse regression model;associated model parameters;time-varying Granger causality;brain-computer interface systems;sensorimotor;multiwavelet basis functions;nonlinear autoregressive;regularized orthogonal least squares;time-varying parametric modeling framework;transient Granger causality detection method;time-varying nonlinear causality detection;MI tasks based brain-computer interface systems;transient causal information flow;nonlinear causal detection;nonstationary signals","","5","","58","","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent efforts have aimed to improve the recording selectivity of PNIs, including by using spatiotemporal patterns from multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Before such a methodology can be translated to humans, its performance in chronic implantation scenarios must be evaluated. We investigated the performance of a CNN-based selective recording approach in the presence of encapsulation tissue, a common immune response to the implantation of a neural interface. This factor was simulated using anatomically accurate computational models of a rat sciatic nerve and nerve cuff electrode. Performance over time was examined in three conditions: training the CNN at baseline only, supervised retraining with explicitly labeled data at periodic intervals, and a semi-supervised self-learning approach. The periodic recalibration approach demonstrated the best results, with an average F1-score of 0.96 ± 0.04, 0.89 ± 0.08, and 0.80 ± 0.08 for SNRs of -5 dB, -10 dB, and -15 dB, respectively, across all time points. Thus, the periodic recalibration approach may be an effective solution to compensate for changes in signal recordings seen over time as a result of encapsulation tissue. The self-learning approach, in which a network is retrained periodically using predicted labels, generally showed degradation in classification performance over time, even as the frequency of training was increased, attributed to an eventual accumulation of mislabeled training data.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176736","","Encapsulation;Electrodes;Training;Calibration;Signal to noise ratio;Finite element analysis;Neural pathways","biological tissues;biomedical electrodes;convolutional neural nets;medical computing;neurophysiology;prosthetics;supervised learning","encapsulation tissue growth;peripheral nerve interfaces;autonomic information;nervous system;control signals;neuroprosthetic systems;recording selectivity;spatiotemporal patterns;multicontact nerve cuff electrodes;convolutional neural network;chronic implantation scenarios;CNN-based selective recording approach;common immune response;neural interface;anatomically accurate computational models;rat sciatic nerve;supervised retraining;explicitly labeled data;periodic intervals;semisupervised self-learning approach;periodic recalibration approach;signal recordings;classification performance;sensory information;motor information;neuromodulation systems;F1-score;mislabeled training data;SNR","Animals;Electrodes;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Rats;Sciatic Nerve;Signal-To-Noise Ratio","","","20","","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A detailed analysis of patters (e.g., labyrinths, letters and angles) was conducted in order to select three very distinguishable levels of difficulty that could be included in the system, and which would yield the greatest benefit in terms of assessment of coordination and strength issues as well as in training. Support algorithms (position, force, velocity, inertia and viscosity) were also developed and incorporated into the tasks in order to introduce general computer assistance to the mapping of the user's movements to the computer screen without overriding the user's commands to the robotic device. In order to evaluate performance (given by %accuracy and time) of the executed tasks, a sophisticated evaluation function was designed based on image analysis and edge detection algorithms.

Large models not only affect model generalization but also put a computational burden on computing an optimal solution especially when the goal is to implement the BMI in low-power, portable hardware. In this paper, three methods are presented to quantitatively rate the importance of neurons in neural to motor mapping, using single neuron correlation analysis, sensitivity analysis through a vector linear model, and a model-independent cellular directional tuning analysis for comparisons purpose. Although, the rankings are not identical, up to sixty percent of the top 10 ranking cells were in common. This set can then be used to determine a reduced-order model whose performance is similar to that of the ensemble. It is further shown that by pruning the initial ensemble neural input with the ranked importance of cells, a reduced sets of cells (between 40 and 80, depending upon the methods) can be found that exceed the BMI performance levels of the full ensemble.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300786","","Neurons;Portable computers;Algorithm design and analysis;Kinematics;Buildings;Explosions;Hardware;Sensitivity analysis;Vectors;Reduced order systems","neurophysiology;bioelectric potentials;medical computing;biomechanics;correlation methods;sensitivity analysis;cellular biophysics;handicapped aids","neurons;brain-machine interfaces algorithms;chronically recorded neuron activity;kinematic variables reconstruction;neural-motor mapping;single neuron correlation analysis;sensitivity analysis;vector linear model;model-independent cellular directional tuning analysis;reduced-order model","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Animals;Cerebral Cortex;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Female;Hand;Likelihood Functions;Macaca;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Movement;Nerve Net;Neurons;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","76","2","29","","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This architecture is part of a computational model of psychosocial dialogue skills, called Y_m_i_r_, that bridges between multimodal perception and multimodal action generation. To test the architecture, a prototype humanoid has been implemented, named G_a_n_d_a_ l_f_, who commands a graphical model of the solar system and can engage in task-directed dialogue with people using speech, manual and facial gesture.

The approach is based on Walter J. Freeman's studies concerning active and rest stages and deviations from Gaussianity. Specifically, we generalize his idea in order to include cases where the neuromodulations are sparse in time. Specifically, the transform maps the temporal sequences to a set of 12-norms where modulated patters are emphasized. In this way, the background, chaotic activity can be modeled as the main lobe of the distribution, while the relevant synchronizations (or desynchronizations) fall on the right (or left) tail of the density of such norms. We test the algorithm on two different datasets: alpha bursts on synthetic data simulated in the BESA software and low-gamma oscillations in the motor cortex from the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition 4 Dataset 4. The results are promising and place the Embedding Transform as a quick, single-parameter tool to effectively assess which channels (or regions) are actively engaged in particular behaviors and which are in a more silent type of stage.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512974","EEG;embedding;gaussianity;non-Stationarity","Transforms;Electroencephalography;Neuromodulation;Brain modeling;Probability density function;Electric potential;Tools","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","chaotic activity;single-parameter tool;single-channel electroencephalogram;brain-computer interface;embedding transform","Algorithms;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Rest","2","","21","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we focus on the model based analysis of the PN and compare the expected model performance with the observed one with real samples.We suggest a model of multi-unit (MU) activity as filtered inhomogeneous Poisson pulses of evoked activity contaminated by homogenous spontaneous activity and thermal noise (Filtered Poisson-Poisson-Gaussian model). By assigning the likelihood into the generalize log likelihood test (GLRT), we show that the best expected feature is energy detection. The model parameters were estimated based on the recorded peri-stimuli-time-histogram (PSTH) by chi-square goodness-of-fit minimization. Monte Carlo simulation showed that the thermal noise can be neglected in respect to the spontaneous activity and also predicted the order of the observed empiric detection performance in terms of detection probability and area under the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).","2373-0803","978-1-4244-2711-6","10.1109/SSP.2009.5278650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5278650","Brain Machine Interface;Neural Decoding;Brainstem;Classical Conditioning;SVM;Electrophysiology;Multi Unit;Poisson Model;GLRT;Detection;ROC;AUC;Simplex;Goodness-of-fit","Brain modeling;Machine learning;Electrodes;Computer vision;Parameter estimation;Neurons;Upper bound;Psychology;Disk recording;Relays","audio signal processing;brain models;brain-computer interfaces;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;neural nets;optimisation","audio stimuli detection;brain-machine interface;conditional learning rehabilitation;discrete motor learning;unconditional stimuli;conditional stimuli;Pontine Nucleus area;Inferior Olive area;multi-unit activity;Filtered Poisson-Poisson-Gaussian model;generalize log likelihood test;energy detection;peri-stimuli-time-histogram;chi-square minimization;goodness-of-fit minimization;Monte Carlo simulation;detection probability;empiric detection performance;receiver operation characteristic curve;thermal noise","","1","","11","","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tendon injuries are common and can be debilitating, and research suggests that a better understanding of their loading conditions could help mitigate injury risk and improve rehabilitation. To that end, we present a novel method of noninvasively assessing parameters related to mechanical load in the Achilles tendon using burst vibrations. Methods: These vibrations, produced by a small vibration motor on the skin superficial to the tendon, are sensed by a skin-mounted accelerometer, which measures the tendon's response to burst excitation under varying tensile load. In this study, twelve healthy subjects performed a variety of everyday tasks designed to expose the Achilles tendon to a range of loading conditions. To approximate the vibration motor-tendon system and provide an explanation for observed changes in tendon response, a 2-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems model was developed. Results: Reliable, characteristic changes in the burst response profile as a function of Achilles tendon tension were observed during all loading tasks. Using a machine learning-based approach, we developed a regression model capable of accurately estimating net ankle moment-which captures general trends in tendon tension-across a range of walking speeds and across subjects (R2 = 0.85). Simulated results of the mechanical model accurately recreated behaviors observed in vivo. Finally, preliminary, proof-of-concept results from a fully wearable system demonstrated trends similar to those observed in experiments conducted using benchtop equipment. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an untethered, unobtrusive system can effectively assess tendon loading during activities of daily life. Significance: Access to such a system would have broad implications for injury recovery and prevention, athletic training, and the study of human movement.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2020.3005353","National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health Smart and Connected Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127089","Achilles tendon;loading;tension;noninvasive;vibration;machine learning;burst response;haptic;wearable","Tendons;Vibrations;Accelerometers;Loading;Skin;Feature extraction;Injuries","accelerometers;biomedical communication;biomedical measurement;body sensor networks;gait analysis;injuries;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;muscle;physiological models;regression analysis;skin","Achilles tendon injuries;musculoskeletal system;mechanical structure;skin superficial;skin-mounted accelerometer;burst excitation;tensile load;burst response profile;tendon tension;wearable system;untethered system;unobtrusive system;Achilles tendon loading;vibration motor-tendon system;machine learning-based approach;regression model;two-degree-of-freedom mechanical system","","","","58","IEEE","26 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although there are current government programs, which aim to solve this problem, the use of telepresence systems can be another viable solution as doctors can still provide quality healthcare services even when located in a remote area. One limitation of medical telepresence robots is the lack of medical features. For this reason, the developed telepresence system includes a telepresence robot called Akibot with integrated medical devices such as otoscope, stethoscope, and ultrasound probe. Akibot is a highly maneuverable remotely controlled telepresence robot designed for general practice medical consultation between doctors and a patient on a remote area.

To ensure successful classification performance to BCI systems, researchers endeavor to extract appropriate features. However, these challenges are based on the conventional method. In this study, EEG signals related to MI tasks are classified using the convolutional neural network (CNN), which does not need a separate feature extraction. EEG records, which are generally evaluated as one-dimensional in machine learning problems, were taken into consideration as the image representation by using a novel method. The datasets were taken from a healthy subject. The subject was asked to move a cursor up and down on a computer screen, while his cortical potentials were taken. The EEG signals recorded over the 3.5-second time interval were evaluated for both the whole time and sub time intervals. Thus, the most effective time interval that has distinguishing features for EEG recordings related to different cursor movements was tried to be determined as well. As a result, it has been shown that the proposed model based on deep learning approach can successfully classify EEG signals related to cursor movements.","","978-1-7281-7565-2","10.1109/UBMK50275.2020.9219507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9219507","EEG;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks;Classification","Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Neurons","brain-computer interfaces;convolutional neural nets;electroencephalography;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","MI tasks;convolutional neural network;feature extraction;EEG records;machine learning;image representation;healthy subject;EEG signals;deep learning;motor imagery classification;EEG-based brain-computer interface systems;successful classification performance;BCI systems;cursor movement automatic detection;CNN","","1","","25","","12 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This tool set allowed us to configure 2.5 million simple nonlinear components (neurons) with 60 billion connections between them (synapses) such that the resulting model can perform eight different perceptual, motor, and cognitive tasks. To reverse-engineer the brain in this way, a method is needed that shows how large numbers of simple components, each of which receives thousands of inputs from other components, can be organized to perform the desired computations. We achieve this through the neural engineering framework (NEF), a mathematical theory that provides methods for systematically generating biologically plausible spiking networks to implement nonlinear and linear dynamical systems. On top of this, we propose the semantic pointer architecture (SPA), a hypothesis regarding some aspects of the organization, function, and representational resources used in the mammalian brain. We conclude by discussing Spaun, which is an example model that uses the SPA and is implemented using the NEF. Throughout, we discuss the software tool Neural ENGineering Objects (Nengo), which allows for the synthesis and simulation of neural models efficiently on the scale of Spaun, and provides support for constructing models using the NEF and the SPA. The resulting NEF/SPA/Nengo combination is a general tool set for both evaluating hypotheses about how the brain works, and for building systems that compute particular functions using neuron-like components.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779629","Neural computation;neural engineering framework (NEF);neural modeling;neuromorphic engineering;semantic pointer architecture (SPA);Spaun;spiking neural networks;Neural computation;neural engineering framework (NEF);neural modeling;neuromorphic engineering;semantic pointer architecture (SPA);Spaun;spiking neural networks","Neurons;Neuroscience;Brain modeling;Decoding;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Statistics;Network architecture","brain models;cognition;large-scale systems;medical computing;neural nets;neurophysiology;nonlinear dynamical systems;reviews","large-scale synthesis;functional spiking neural circuits;review;theoretical tool;software tool;brain model;cognitive task;simple nonlinear components;synapses;perceptual task;motor task;reverse-engineer;neural engineering framework;mathematical theory;biologically plausible spiking networks;nonlinear dynamical systems;semantic pointer architecture;organization resources;function resources;representational resources;mammalian brain;Neural ENGineering Objects;neural model synthesis;neural model simulation;Spaun scale;NEF/SPA/Nengo combination;neuron-like components","","44","","69","","27 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

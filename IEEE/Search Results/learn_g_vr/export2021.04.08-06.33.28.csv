The author has also developed a generalized synthesis approach to the design of such harness systems. Unwanted rotational inertial loads felt by the user are minimized while compliant constraints have been tailored to provide natural feedback forces. These ergonomic forces enhance the experience of virtual motion by partially substituting for the missing real-world dynamic loads encountered in locomotion. They also provide subtle, natural cues to the immersed user that aid the user in remaining centered. Unlike some other virtual locomotion systems, these devices are passive, relatively low-cost, easy and natural to use, making them minimally intrusive on the process of learning the simulated task","","1-4244-0907-1","10.1109/3DUI.2007.340776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4142847","","Ergonomics;Virtual environment;Virtual reality;Turning;Haptic interfaces;Human factors;User interfaces;Tracking;Magnetic heads;Aerospace engineering","ergonomics;virtual reality","ergonomic harness mechanism;full-body natural constrained motion;virtual environment;virtual reality harness mechanism;virtual locomotion sensing system;rotational inertial;natural feedback force;ergonomic force;virtual motion;real-world dynamic load;virtual locomotion system","","3","3","2","","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But they are generally stricken with high sample complexity, which puts forward a critical challenge for their application to real-world robots. Dynamic models are essential for robot control laws, but it is often hard to obtain accurate analytical dynamic models. Therefore a data-driven approach to learning models becomes significant for reinforcement learning to increase data efficiency. Model-based algorithms are effective methods to reduce sample complexity by learning the system dynamic model. However, in certain environments, it has been proven that learning an accurate system dynamic model is a formidable problem, and their asymptotic performance cannot achieve to the same level as model-free algorithms. In our work, we use an ensemble of deep neural networks to learn system dynamics and incorporate model uncertainty. Then in order to merge the high asymptotic performance of the advanced model-free methods, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is adopted to optimize robot control policy. Furthermore, it has been implemented within ROS for controlling a Baxter robot in the simulation environment.","","978-1-7281-6479-3","10.1109/ICARM49381.2020.9195341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195341","","Robots;Heuristic algorithms;Training;Neural networks;Learning (artificial intelligence);Data models;System dynamics","dexterous manipulators;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neural nets","data-driven approach;learning models;model-based algorithms;system dynamic model;model-free algorithms;deep neural networks;system dynamics;model uncertainty;model-free methods;deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm;robot control policy;Baxter robot;model-based reinforcement;model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms;real-world robots;robot control laws;analytical dynamic models;MFRL;DDPG;ROS","","","","24","","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can be said that the FFTC is based on a class of passive and distributive models with uncertainties. To compensate enormous uncertainties, a fuzzy fixed-time learning control (FFTLC) by learning two unknown coefficients for the upper bound of uncertainties in each subsystem is designed. As compared with radial basis function neural network, the computational complexity for the compensated uncertainties is much simple. It can be said that an FFTLC is based on a class of online active and distributive uncertain models. Due to the fixed-time control design, the transients often occur, particularly for the larger uncertainties or initial tracking error.

Nowadays, many different types of electronic systems exist for e-learning, m-learning, general electronic presentation systems for helping lecturers to make education more attractive and helpful for students. The electronic presentation systems offer teachers to prepare and present their educational materials in simpler way and allow presenting more information, figures and interesting documents for students. Such presentation systems are mainly helpful for teachers but presentation does not have to be attractive for students because they are not actively involved into the education. Current technologies offer Tablet PCs with new input - touch-screen display and stylus for writing some remarks into slides by hand. Both, teachers and students can use this input. But students are not still involved directly into the teaching process, thus a teacher has less information about students' knowledge. In addition, presentation systems are generally implemented in such way the teacher has to prepare all materials before its presentation. The paper presents a new interactive electronic presentation system for design and test of digital circuits. The developed system, named D&T Presenter allows integration of new methods into the education using interactive works with students based on on-line anonymous test and answer sheets during lectures.

However, the problem of how to precisely predict users' future requests and push or cache the proper content remains to be solved. In this paper, we investigate a joint pushing and caching policy in a general mobile edge computing (MEC) network with multiuser and multicast data. We formulate the joint pushing and caching problem as an infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision process (MDP). Our aim is not only to maximize bandwidth utilization but also to decrease the total quantity of data transmitted. Then, a joint pushing and caching policy based on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is proposed, which considers both long-term file popularity and short-term temporal correlations of user requests to fully utilize bandwidth. To address the curse of dimensionality, we apply a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose the joint base station and user cache optimization problem into two subproblems: the user cache optimization subproblem and the base station cache optimization subproblem. We apply value function approximation Q-learning and a deep Q-network (DQN) to solve these two subproblems. Furthermore, we provide some insights into the design of deep reinforcement learning in network caching. The simulation results show that the proposed policy can learn content popularity very well and predict users' future demands precisely. Our approach outperforms existing schemes on various parameters including the base station cache size, the number of users and the total number of files in multiple scenarios.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.3000396","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Program Major Science and Technology Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110932","Joint pushing and caching;deep reinforcement learning;mobile edge network","Base stations;Optimization;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth;Correlation;Markov processes;Throughput","cache storage;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;optimisation;telecommunication computing","hierarchical reinforcement learning;long-term file popularity;short-term temporal correlations;user requests;user cache optimization subproblem;base station cache optimization subproblem;deep Q-network;deep reinforcement learning;network caching;base station cache size;mobile edge computing network;optimal computing;infinite-horizon average-cost;Markov decision process;optimal caching;multiuser data;multicast data;pushing-caching policy;divide-and-conquer strategy;value function approximation","","2","","27","IEEE","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A bag-of-words approach is employed to build feature vectors for training the SVM classifiers, which utilizes the shape context descriptors computed from each scan point. The global localization process consists of two stages: coarse localization and fine localization. Coarse localization from the SVM-based place recognition selects candidate places where the robot may be located, and fine localization computes the relative poses to the candidate places with fast spectral scan matching and estimates the correct robot pose with a particle filter algorithm, in which the candidate poses are exploited as seeds for initial random sampling.

Besides, the mobility of teachers and students among European universities has increased notably, which is a very positive experience for both communities. In this regard, new educational alternatives have to be found for this purpose, not only to provide the possibility of studying a subject abroad, but also to improve cross-curricular capabilities. It is also a reality to be taken into account that an increasing number of students are already working in the industry while following up their studies. E-learning environments are the perfect answer to these requirements, where a varied range of activities and methodologies can be used for allowing to follow the subject virtually as well as promote general cross-curricular skills such as addressing an audience, team work and preparing documentation.

The neural network weight vector is very convenient to initialize by virtue of the improved critic learning formulation. Under the action of the approximate optimal control law, the stability issues for the closed-loop form of nominal and uncertain plants are analyzed, respectively. Simulation illustrations via a typical nonlinear system and a practical power system are included to verify the control performance.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2749641","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Natural Science Foundation; Early Career Development Award of SKLMCCS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053899","Adaptive critic;dynamical uncertainty;learning systems;neural networks;optimal control;robust stabilization","Robustness;Uncertainty;Optimal control;Nonlinear systems;Cost function;Robust control;Adaptive systems","adaptive control;closed loop systems;learning systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;robust control;uncertain systems","neural network weight vector;improved critic learning formulation;approximate optimal control law;stability issues;nonlinear systems;dynamical uncertainties;nonlinear control systems;adaptive critic control strategies;neural network learning component;robust stabilization scheme;approximate optimal controller;original uncertain dynamics;adaptive critic technique","","21","","32","","29 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the cross-modulation among different subchannel would greatly degrade the performance of system due to the non-linearity of the large-scale amplifier array. Hybrid precoding technology is a general candidate for this problem due to its capability for linearization, and the predistortion matrix would be the key factor for its performance. In this paper, a memory polynomial model is adopted for modelling nonlinear power amplifier (PA) and Recursive Least Square based digital predistortion (RLS-DPD) algorithm is proposed for parameter training for hybrid predistortion module. The proposed RLS algorithm extracts the parameters of the digital predistortion module through adaptive learning in the training phase. Adaptive learning refers to the process of using the filter parameters obtained at the previous moment to automatically adjust the parameters at the current moment according to the estimated error, which minimizes the cost function. The simulation results show that the RLS-DPD algorithm can reduce the system bit error rate by 27.778%, error vector magnitude (EVM) by 67.961 % at 8dB SNR, and enable the nonlinear OFDM signal to be demodulated correctly at the terminal.","","978-1-7281-9045-7","10.1109/ICEICT51264.2020.9334360","111 project; Beijing Nova Program; Beijing Science and Technology Plan Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9334360","nonlinear;hybrid precoding structure;MIMO-OFDM communication system;predistortion","Training;Adaptive learning;Adaptation models;Precoding;OFDM;Simulation;Predistortion","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;microwave power amplifiers;millimetre wave communication;millimetre wave power amplifiers;MIMO communication;nonlinear distortion;OFDM modulation;polynomials;precoding;telecommunication computing;terahertz waves;wireless channels","RLS-DPD algorithm;hybrid precoding architecture;MIMO-OFDM systems;terahertz communication;large-scale amplifier array;hybrid precoding technology;predistortion matrix;memory polynomial model;nonlinear power amplifier;hybrid predistortion module;adaptive learning;nonlinear OFDM signal;5G communication systems;6G communication systems;millimeter wave communication;recursive least square based digital predistortion algorithm;error vector magnitude","","","","13","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exploiting machine learning for these routing problems has received increasing attention in recent years due to its flexibility and localized mechanisms. However, with such an approach the resulting protocols often have additional memory and processing time requirements. Nevertheless, these requirements are within the reach of today's WSN hardware, however few substantial tests have been performed to clearly demonstrate this. This paper evaluates and discusses the results and experiences gained from implementing our reinforcement learning based multicast routing protocol (FROMS) in a testbed of ScatterWeb nodes. A comparison of our results is made to a well-known WSN routing scheme, namely a multicast variation of directed diffusion. Our evaluation includes several minor, but practical modifications to both protocols such as transmission backoffs and the use of acknowledgments.This paper offers three main contributions. First, we demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can be efficiently implemented on resource restricted devices and that they perform very well in multiple network scenarios. Second, we confirm the validity of simulation results obtained in a previous evaluation of FROMS, and at the same time gather delivery rates under realistic settings. Finally, we offer some general observations on properties and pitfalls of WSN implementations along with potential solutions.","2160-4894","978-0-7695-3393-3","10.1109/WiMob.2008.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654244","wireless sensor networks;routing;reinforcement learning;real hardware;testbed;scatterweb","Routing protocols;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Random access memory;Hardware;Machine learning","learning (artificial intelligence);multicast communication;routing protocols;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor network;multihop data dissemination;machine learning;WSN hardware;reinforcement learning based multicast routing protocol;ScatterWeb nodes;directed diffusion;transmission backoffs;resource restricted devices;FROMS protocol","","11","","18","","21 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, deterministic learning theory is incorporated with consensus theory to find a common neural network (NN) approximation of the nonlinear uncertain dynamics for the multi-robot system. Specifically, we first present a control scheme called cooperative deterministic learning using adaptive NNs to enable the robotic agents to track their respective reference trajectories on one hand, and to exchange their estimated NN weights online through networked communication on the other. As a result, a consensus about one common NN approximation for the nonlinear uncertain dynamics is achieved for all the agents.

However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies.

To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.","","978-1-7281-3182-5","10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970131","computational thinking;programming;learning resource;teacher support tools;ontology","","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;ontologies (artificial intelligence);teaching","ontology based approach;computational thinking;long learning process;programming languages;computer programming;computer science;computing classes;learning resources","","1","","15","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement-Learning (DRL) based SBS activation strategy that activates the optimal subset of SBSs to significantly lower the energy consumption without compromising the quality of service. In particular, we formulate the SBS on/off switching problem into a Markov Decision Process that can be solved by Actor Critic (AC) reinforcement learning methods. To avoid prohibitively high computational and storage costs of conventional tabular-based approaches, we propose to use deep neural networks to approximate the policy and value functions in the AC approach. Moreover, to expedite the training process, we adopt a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach together with a novel action refinement scheme.

A dynamic controller for a full six-degree-of-freedom manipulator has been developed based on a backpropagation neural network. Unsupervised learning called feedback error learning is used to train the net. Although absolutely no dynamic model or its parameters were known (the robot is treated as a complete black box), it implicitly learns the robot's dynamic properties through repetitive movement trials. Importantly, this black box model can automatically take care of some of the unmodeled effects such as friction and vibrations. Its control performance has been tested on a simulated PUMA 560, demonstrating fast learning and convergence. Furthermore, the neurocontroller exhibits adaptation to changing loads without load sensors, generalization over unlearned trajectories, and robustness against sensor noise.<>","","0-7803-0164-1","10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=155675","","Manipulator dynamics;Robots;Robotics and automation;Backpropagation;Neural networks;Unsupervised learning;Neurofeedback;Friction;Automatic control;Testing","learning systems;neural nets;robots","dynamic control;learning systems;six degree-of-freedom robot;manipulator;neural networks;feedback error learning;simulated PUMA 560;neurocontroller;sensor noise","","2","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The symmetry operations are the permutation of any pair of input or output signals and the interchange of ones and zeros in the input. A supervised learning protocol for feedforward neural networks is proposed based on such grouping of functions. The learning is assumed to take place in two stages. In the first stage, synaptic efficacies are adapted with a cost function that vanishes if the Boolean function that is represented belongs to the same symmetry class as the target one. The function thus chosen is taken as an archetype of the whole symmetry class. The second stage consists of performing a symmetry transformation to obtain a synaptic matrix that represents the target function. Simulations on small networks that show how this learning protocol increases the probability of generalization for most of the target functions are reported. This learning protocol can help to model dyslexic types of mistakes as arising from a partial learning.

However, obtaining reliable feedforward actions requires very accurate models, which are not always available for soft robots. Learning-based approaches are a promising solution to the problem. They proved to be an effective strategy achieving good tracking performance, while preserving the system intrinsic compliance. Nevertheless, learning methods require rich data sets, and issues of scalability and generalization still remain to be solved. This letter proposes a method to generalize learned control actions to execute a desired trajectory with different velocities - with the ultimate goal of making these learning-based architectures sample efficient.

The adaptation is driven by the spontaneous fluctuations in the system input and output, the covariance of which provides useful information about the changes in the system behavior. The control structure represents a novel form of associative reinforcement learning in which the reinforcement signal is implicitly given by the covariance of the input-output (I/O) signals. Theoretical foundations for the paradigm are derived using Lyapunov theory and are verified by means of computer simulations. The learning algorithm is applicable to a general class of nonlinear adaptive control problems. This on-line direct adaptive control method benefits from a computationally straightforward design, proof of convergence, no need for complete system identification, robustness to noise and uncertainties, and the ability to optimize a general performance criterion in terms of system states and control signals. These attractive properties of Hebbian feedback covariance learning control lend themselves to future investigations into the computational functions of synaptic plasticity in biological neurons.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.915341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915341","","Feedback;Adaptive control;Programmable control;Optimal control;Brain modeling;Adaptation model;Fluctuations;Learning;Computer simulation;Signal design","optimal control;Hebbian learning;adaptive control","feedback covariance learning;self-tuning optimal control;adaptive optimal control;Hebbian covariance synaptic adaptation;Hebbian feedback covariance learning;Lyapunov theory","","14","","48","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for the MIMO system with received SNR feedback, of which goal is to estimate the MIMO channel coefficients at a transmitter based on the received SNR feedback information from a receiver in the sense of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. For analysis, we consider two very common and widely adopted scenarios of fading: (i) quasi-static block fading and (ii) time-varying fading. In both fading scenarios, it is generally challenging to analytically tackle the channel estimation problem due to its nonlinearity and nonconvexity. To intelligently and effectively address this issue, deep learning is exploited in this paper. First, in the quasi-static block fading scenario, we propose a novel learning scheme for joint channel estimation and pilot signal design by constructing a deep autoencoder via a convolutional neural network (CNN). Also, in the time-varying fading scenario, a novel channel estimation scheme is developed by connecting a recurrent neural network (RNN) to a CNN. Moreover, in both fading scenarios, we present new and effective ways to train the proposed schemes using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address the practical issue of a limited number of actual channel samples (i.e., real-world data) required for training. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006518","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF); Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9131701","Autoencoder;channel estimation;convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;generative adversarial network (GAN);recurrent neural network (RNN);received SNR feedback;pilot signal design","Channel estimation;Signal to noise ratio;MIMO communication;Transmitters;Fading channels;Deep learning;Feature extraction","channel estimation;convolutional neural nets;fading channels;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;MIMO communication;recurrent neural nets;telecommunication computing;time-varying channels","recurrent neural network;RNN;generative adversarial networks;GANs;extensive numerical simulations;CNN;convolutional neural network;deep autoencoder;pilot signal design;wireless multiple-input multiple-output systems;joint channel estimation;quasistatic block fading scenario;deep learning;received SNR feedback information;MIMO channel coefficients;received signal-to-noise ratio;MIMO system;novel channel estimation scheme;time-varying fading scenario","","2","","41","CCBY","2 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These factors are optimized iteratively using machine learning, where the optimization can be efficiently solved by a small and shallow neural network with training data produced by the LAMS decoder. The neural network is built according to the parity check matrix of a PB-LDPC code with a QC structure which can greatly reduce the size of the neural network. Since, we optimize the factors once per decoding iteration, the optimization is not limited by the number of the iterations. Then, we give the optimized results of the factors in the LAMS decoder and perform decoding simulations for PB-LDPC codes in fifth generation mobile networks (5G).

Whereas previous work in 4D performance capture has shown impressive results in studio settings, the technology is still far from being accessible to a typical consumer who, at best, might own a single RGBD sensor. Thus, in this work, we propose a method to synthesize free viewpoint renderings using a single RGBD camera. The key insight is to leverage previously seen “calibration” images of a given user to extrapolate what should be rendered in a novel viewpoint from the data available in the sensor. Given these past observations from multiple viewpoints, and the current RGBD image from a fixed view, we propose an end-to-end framework that fuses both these data sources to generate novel renderings of the performer. We demonstrate that the method can produce high fidelity images, and handle extreme changes in subject pose and camera viewpoints. We also show that the system generalizes to performers not seen in the training data. We run exhaustive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed semi-parametric model (i.e. calibration images available to the neural network) compared to other state of the art machine learned solutions. Further, we compare the method with more traditional pipelines that employ multi-view capture. We show that our framework is able to achieve compelling results, with substantially less infrastructure than previously required.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-3293-8","10.1109/CVPR.2019.00994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8954320","3D from Single Image;Deep Learning ; Image and Video Synthesis","","calibration;cameras;image colour analysis;image sensors;image texture;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","single RGBD camera;semiparametric learning;volumetric performance capture;4D performance capture;studio settings;typical consumer;single RGBD sensor;free viewpoint renderings;calibration images;multiple viewpoints;current RGBD image;end-to-end framework;data sources;novel renderings;high fidelity images;camera viewpoints;training data;semiparametric model;employ multiview capture;machine learned solutions","","","","51","","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider the two agent setting where agents must learn modulation and demodulation schemes that enable them to communicate with each other in the presence of a power-constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We investigate whether learning is possible under different levels of information sharing between distributed agents that are not necessarily co-designed. We make use of the “Echo” protocol, a learning protocol where an agent hears, understands, and repeats (echoes) back the message received from another agent. Each agent uses what it sends and receives to train itself to communicate. To capture the idea of cooperation between agents that are “not necessarily co-designed,” we use two different populations of function approximators - neural networks and polynomials. In addition to diverse learning agents, we include non-learning agents that use fixed standardized modulation protocols such as QPSK and 16QAM. This is used to verify that the Echo approach to learning to communicate works independent of the inner workings of the agents, and that learning agents can not only learn to match the communication expectations of others, but can also collaboratively invent a successful communication approach from independent random initializations. In addition to simulation-based experiments, we implement the Echo protocol in physical software-defined radio experiments to verify that it can work with real radios. To explore the continuum between tight co-design of learning agents and independently designed agents, we study how learning is impacted by different levels of information sharing - including sharing training symbols, sharing intermediate loss information, and sharing full gradient information. The resulting learning techniques span supervised learning and reinforcement learning. We find that in general, co-design (increased information sharing) accelerates learning and that this effect becomes more pronounced as the communication task becomes harder.","","978-1-7281-3151-1","10.1109/ALLERTON.2019.8919749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919749","","Protocols;Demodulation;Information management;Training;Task analysis;Machine learning","AWGN channels;demodulation;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;protocols;quadrature amplitude modulation;quadrature phase shift keying;software agents;software radio;telecommunication computing","independently designed agents;information sharing;resulting learning techniques;supervised learning;reinforcement learning;communication task;wireless communication;demodulation schemes;power-constrained additive white Gaussian noise channel;distributed agents;Echo protocol;learning protocol;diverse learning agents;nonlearning agents;standardized modulation protocols;Echo approach;communication expectations;successful communication approach;tight co-design","","1","","45","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An analog computer implementation of an unsupervised neural network was investigated. Results indicate that the implementation of the nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the Outstar learning model are destabilized by unavoidable multiplicative biases produced by physical circuitry, attributable to 1/f noise drift. A multiplicative offset perturbation model was developed to simulate the instabilities discovered in the analog implementation. Timing and scaling optimizations are required to allow stable learning of spatial patterns. These results were generalized with the hypothesis that real-time unsupervised neural networks are nonimplementable in natural noise. The perturbation model facilitates the testing of this hypothesis. It seems that 1/f phenomena are teleologically related to physically occurring self-organizing systems.

Therefore, it is challenging to model the mapping from material and user interactions to haptic feedback in a way that generalizes over many variations of the user's input. Current methodologies are typically conditioned on user interactions, but require a separate model for each material. In this paper, we present a learned action-conditional model that uses data from a vision-based tactile sensor (GelSight) and user's action as input. This model predicts an induced acceleration that could be used to provide haptic vibration feedback to a user. We trained our proposed model on a publicly available dataset (Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit) that we augmented with GelSight measurements of the different materials.

A significant body of research has demonstrated how perception and action work in such environments, but most of this work has been done studying adults. Less is known about how physical and cognitive development affect perception and action in IVEs, particularly as applied to preteen and teenage children. Accordingly, in the current study we assess how preteens (children aged 8-12 years) and teenagers (children aged 15-18 years) respond to mismatches between their motor behavior and the visual information presented by an IVE. Over two experiments, we evaluate how these individuals recalibrate their actions across functionally distinct systems of movement. The first experiment analyzed forward walking recalibration after exposure to an IVE with either increased or decreased visual flow. Visual flow during normal bipedal locomotion was manipulated to be either twice or half as fast as the physical gait. The second experiment leveraged a prism throwing adaptation paradigm to test the effect of recalibration on throwing movement. In the first experiment, our results show no differences across age groups, although subjects generally experienced a post-exposure effect of shortened distance estimation after experiencing visually faster flow and longer distance estimation after experiencing visually slower flow. In the second experiment, subjects generally showed the typical prism adaptation behavior of a throwing after-effect error. The error lasted longer for preteens than older children. Our results have implications for the design of virtual systems with children as a target audience.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794072","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267487","Virtual environments;perceptual-motor recalibration;perception;children","Legged locomotion;Visualization;Virtual environments;Biomechanics;Calibration;Electronic mail","gait analysis;virtual reality;visual perception","teenage children;visual information;normal bipedal locomotion;physical gait;adaptation paradigm;throwing movement;post-exposure effect;visually faster flow;visually slower flow;throwing after-effect error;virtual systems;locomotive recalibration;immersive virtual environments;action work;physical development;cognitive development;visual flow;virtual reality;prism adaptation behavior;time 8 year to 12 year;time 15 year to 18 year","Adaptation, Physiological;Adolescent;Child;Female;Humans;Male;Perception;Psychomotor Performance;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Walking","","","81","Traditional","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through training on a large-scale video dataset, most existing approaches aim to explore disentangled appearance and pose representations of training frames. Then, the desired output with a specific appearance and pose can be synthesized via recombining learned representations. However, in some real-world applications, test images may lack the corresponding video ground-truth or follow a different distribution than the distribution of the training video frames (i.e., different domains), which largely limit the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose domain-independent pose representations that are compatible with and accessible by still images from a different domain. Specifically, we devise a two-stage self-supervised pose adaptation framework for general image animation tasks. A domain-independent pose adaptation generative adversarial network (DIPA-GAN) and a shuffle-patch generative adversarial network (Shuffle-patch GAN) are proposed to penalize the rationality of the synthesized frame's pose and appearance, respectively. Finally, experiments evaluated on various image animation tasks, which include same/cross-domain moving objects, facial expression transfer and human pose retargeting, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over prior literature. Impact Statement-Image animation is a popular technology in video production. Benefiting from the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), recent image animation algorithms have been widely used in real-world applications, such as virtual AI news anchor, virtual try-on, and face swapping. However, most existing methods are designed for specific cases. To animate a new portrait, users are asked to collect hundreds of images of the same person and train a new model. The technology proposed in this paper overcomes these training limitations and generalizes image animations. In the challenging cross-domain facial expression transfer task, the user study demonstrated that our technology achieved more than 20% increase in animation success rate. The proposed technology could benefit users in a wide variety of industries including movie production, virtual reality, social media and online retail.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2020.3031581","Australian Research Council Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229197","Adversarial learning;deep learning;representation learning","Animation;Task analysis;Training;Generative adversarial networks;Artificial intelligence;Solid modeling;Adaptation models","computer animation;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pose estimation;video signal processing;virtual reality","cross-domain image animation;video sequence;large-scale video dataset;learned representations;adaptation framework;general image animation tasks;adaptation generative adversarial network;shuffle-patch generative adversarial network;synthesized frame;video production;animation success rate;cross-domain facial expression transfer task;image animation algorithm;video ground-truth","","","","59","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome the challenges of unknown dynamics and prohibitive computation, we apply the concept of reinforcement learning and implement a deep Q-network (DQN). We first study the optimal policy for fixedpattern channel switching with known system dynamics and show through simulations that DQN can achieve the same optimal performance without knowing the system statistics. We then compare the performance of DQN with a Myopic policy and a Whittle Index-based heuristic through both more general simulations as well as real data trace and show that DQN achieves near-optimal performance in more complex situations.

A class of adaptive critic designs that can be classified as (model-free) action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming is used in the present project. Adaptive critic designs are defined as designs that approximate dynamic programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control over time in noisy, nonlinear environment. The present work uses a system, called ""critic"", to approximate the cost function in dynamic programming and thus to achieve optimal control. The goals of the present learning control design for automotive engines are emissions reduction and maintenance of optimal performance under various operating conditions. Using the data obtained from a test vehicle, we first develop a neural network model of the engine. A neural network controller is then designed based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control. In the simulation studies, the initial controller is trained using the neural network engine model developed rather than the actual engine. We have developed and tested self-learning neural network controllers for both engine torque and exhaust airfuel ratio control. For both control problems, good transient performance of the neural network controller has been observed. A distinct feature of the present technique is the controller's real-time adaptation capability based on real vehicle data which allows the neural network controller to be further refined and improved in real-time vehicle operation through continuous learning.","0743-1619","0-7803-8335-4","10.23919/ACC.2004.1383945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383945","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Automotive engineering;Engines;Neural networks;Dynamic programming;Optimal control;Torque control;Vehicles;Working environment noise","neurocontrollers;control system synthesis;optimal control;adaptive control;learning systems;pollution control;dynamic programming;internal combustion engines;torque control","automotive engine control;adaptive critic learning techniques;air-fuel ratio control;heuristic dynamic programming;optimal control;learning control design;emissions reduction;neural network;engine torque","","5","1","36","","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In categorical modularization, the components perform different versions of basically the same task, such as antibodies in the immune system. This second aspect is the more natural for acquiring strategies in games of conflict, An evolutionary learning system is presented which follows this second approach to automatically create a repertoire of specialist strategies for a game-playing system. This relieves the human effort of deciding how to divide and specialize. The genetic algorithm speciation method used is one based on fitness sharing.

OL-ELM-RPLS is an improvement to the online sequential extreme learning machine based on recursive least-squares (OS-ELM-RLS) introduced in [1]. Like in the batch extreme learning machine (ELM), in OS-ELM-RLS the input weights of a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) are randomly generated, however the output weights are obtained by a recursive least-squares (RLS) solution. However, due to multicollinearities in the columns of the hidden-layer output matrix caused by the presence of redundant input variables or by a large number of hidden-layer neurons, the problem of estimation the output weights can become ill-conditioned. In order to circumvent or mitigate such ill-conditioning problem, it is proposed to replace the RLS method by the recursive partial least-squares (RPLS) method. The identification methodology is proposed for two application problems: (1) construction of a inferential model, and (2) the learning of a model for the Generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm. The integration of the proposed adaptive identification method with the GPC results in an adaptive predictive control methodology. To validate and demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methodologies, they are applied on modeling of two public regression data sets and on control of the flow through a simulated valve.","1553-572X","978-1-4799-4032-5","10.1109/IECON.2014.7048477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048477","","Neurons;Tin;Vectors;Adaptation models;Predictive control;Predictive models;Input variables","adaptive control;feedforward neural nets;identification;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;least squares approximations;neurocontrollers;predictive control;regression analysis","adaptive identification;online sequential extreme learning machine;recursive partial least-squares method;OS-ELM-RPLS;batch extreme learning machine;single-hidden layer feedforward neural network;SLFN;output weights;multicollinearities;hidden-layer output matrix;redundant input variables;hidden-layer neurons;ill-conditioning problem;identification methodology;inferential model;generalized predictive control;GPC algorithm;adaptive predictive control methodology;regression data sets","","1","","19","","26 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the high path loss, the performance of mmWave-based HB is significantly impacted by channel degradation, especially when the number of the available transmission path is less than the transmission streams. Driven by deep learning (DL) based beamforming, we propose a non-orthogonal precoding based HB scheme for the deterioration of channel transmission. Instead of directly applying the neural network as the beamforming function, we present the insight and theoretical analysis of the beamforming strategy in the DL based HB. By studying the beamforming behavior, we designed and formulated deep learning driven hybrid beamforming method. Compared with the existing DL-based hybrid beamforming, the neural network in the proposed method acts as a general neural codebook, which avoids network training even channel changed. In the overloaded channel condition, the proposed deep learning driven non-orthogonal precoding can solve the problem of channel degradation, which improves the robustness for hybrid beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve significant performance improvement over existing ones in overloaded transmission conditions. We also designed and implemented our scheme over the FPGA platform, which shows a much lower hardware cost than other existing schemes.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2020.2991446","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9082619","Hybrid beamforming;MIMO systems;overloaded transmission;deep learning driven;non-orthogonal precoding;low computational complexity","Array signal processing;Radio frequency;MIMO communication;Neural networks;Deep learning;NOMA;Training","array signal processing;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);millimetre wave communication;neural nets;precoding;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","millimeter wave transmission;channel degradation;deep learning;nonorthogonal precoding;channel transmission;neural network;hybrid beamforming method;general neural codebook;overloaded channel condition;overloaded transmission conditions;millimeter wave communications;DL-based hybrid beamforming","","1","","37","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike many distributed algorithms which rely on all-time communication protocols, we propose an efficient method by switching between Bayesian and non-Bayesian regimes. In this model, agents exchange information only when their private signals are not informative enough; thence, by switching between the two regimes, agents efficiently learn the truth using only a few rounds of communications.

For this reason, the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that can identify drowsy driving states is a crucial and urgent topic of study. Many EEG-based BCIs have been developed as artificial auxiliary systems for use in various practical applications because of the benefits of measuring EEG signals.

However, the existing NOMA systems have a fundamental limit: high computational complexity and a sharply changing wireless channel make exploiting the characteristics of the channel and deriving the ideal allocation methods very difficult tasks. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper, we propose a novel and effective deep learning (DL)-aided NOMA system, in which several NOMA users with random deployment are served by one base station. Since DL is advantageous in that it allows training the input signals and detecting sharply changing channel conditions, we exploit it to address wireless NOMA channels in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, it is employed in the proposed NOMA system to learn a completely unknown channel environment. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network based on DL is incorporated into a typical NOMA system, enabling the proposed scheme to detect the channel characteristics automatically. In the proposed strategy, the LSTM is first trained by simulated data under different channel conditions via offline learning, and then the corresponding output data can be obtained based on the current input data used during the online learning process. In general, we build, train and test the proposed cooperative framework to realize automatic encoding, decoding and channel detection in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Furthermore, we regard one conventional user activity and data detection scheme as an unknown nonlinear mapping operation and use LSTM to approximate it to evaluate the data detection capacity of DL based on NOMA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient compared with conventional approaches. In addition, the accuracy of the LSTM-aided NOMA scheme is studied by introducing the well-known tenfold cross-validation procedure.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2018.2848294","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor; Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Jiangsu High-level Talent; 1311 Talent Plan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387468","Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);long short-term memory (LSTM);deep learning","NOMA;Machine learning;Resource management;Reliability;Wireless communication;Channel estimation;Training","AWGN channels;channel coding;computational complexity;decoding;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-access systems;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","offline learning;current input data;online learning process;additive white Gaussian noise channel;conventional user activity;data detection scheme;data detection capacity;LSTM-aided NOMA scheme;effective nonorthogonal multiple access scheme;essential multiple access technique;system capacity;spectral efficiency;future communication scenarios;high computational complexity;wireless channel;NOMA users;base station;input signals;wireless NOMA channels;end-to-end manner;completely unknown channel environment;short-term memory network;channel characteristics;channel conditions;NOMA systems;ideal allocation methods","","231","","33","","18 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The critic estimates the cost-to-go function which is tuned online using recursive equations derived from heuristic dynamic programming. Here, neural networks (NNs) are used both for the action and critic whereas any OLAs, such as radial basis functions, splines, fuzzy logic, etc., can be utilized. For the output-feedback counterpart, an additional NN is designated as the observer to estimate the unavailable system states, and thus, separation principle is not required.

Generally, the vehicle and the multi-axial hydraulic test rig behave strong nonlinearities, which requires a large number of iterations to correct the tracking error. Hence, the process of drive file (i.e., the input signals which drive the actuators of the test rig) generation is time-lengthy and tedious. A method that combines the ILC with the Quasi-Newton algorithm over the complex space (QNILC) is developed to speed up the drive file construction for the multi-axial vibration test rig. The impedance matrix can be updated with Broyden's method to reduce the modeling errors and make the iteration more robust. An auxiliary estimating loop is inserted into the iteration process to attain an optimal learning gain. The convergence of the proposed method has been proven to be monotonic. This approach is validated through simulation, where the target signals are the real-life spindle forces gathered from the wheel force transducer. The simulation results demonstrate that the QNILC can improve the convergence rate and increase the tracking accuracy than the current offline ILC. The QNILC reduces the iteration number from nine down to five to converge to the desirable index compared with the offline ILC using gain 0.5.

Previous research already investigated the effects of psychological processes such as immersion, flow and involvement in context of VRs. However, there are also more basic psychological processes such as perception and attention which both play a crucial role when creating and using VRs. Due to perceptual processes we perceive input from our environment and create a subjective reality in our mind which often does not correspond to the objective reality. Due to attentional processes, we are able to filter relevant information that is processed via our senses from all perceivable information. In the current study, we interviewed technicians about their degree of awareness and knowledge about such attentional and perceptual processes in general and within VRs. The findings showed that there is a lack of knowledge regarding these processes, suggesting that there is need for a broader discussion of the topic. This work aims to be the first step towards this direction.","","978-953-233-095-3","10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8400119","virtual realities;perception;attention;technicians","Psychology;Virtual reality;Entertainment industry;Computer architecture;Medical treatment;Information filters","psychology;virtual reality","Psychological background;virtual realities;VR;relevant information filtering","","","","21","","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the proposed learning method avoids the possibility of convergence toward the boundary of the parameter space, and is also capable of selecting the optimal order for a GMM with more enhanced stability than conventional methods using a flat prior. When applying the proposed learning method to construct a GMM classifier for electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition, the proposed GMM classifier achieves a high generalization ability and outperforms conventional classifiers in terms of recognition accuracy.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2015177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4785180","Bayesian–Laplace approaches;conjugate priors;electromyogram pattern recognition;Gaussian mixture models;maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates;multifunction myoelectric hand","Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Learning systems;Bayesian methods;Parameter estimation;Fourier transforms;Hidden Markov models;Probability density function;Maximum likelihood estimation;Brain modeling","Bayes methods;biology computing;biomechanics;electromyography;Gaussian processes;learning systems;pattern recognition","conjugate-prior-penalized learning;Gaussian mixture models;multifunction myoelectric hand control;Bayesian-Laplace approaches;electromyogram pattern recognition","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Muscle Contraction;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Robotics;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","22","","19","","18 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, some of the algorithms proposed so far are of high storage complexity. Others, being extensions of the Hopfield model, have quite limited storage capacity. Generalizing the work of Doya and Yoshizawa (1989) as well as Urbanczik (1990), the author derives an algorithm for training network of arbitrary connectivity with hidden units. The algorithm requires O(n)-storage in addition to the weight matrix. Numerical simulations, pertaining to the learning of limit cycles and to the modelling of Markov chains, show that quite complex temporal behaviour can be trained by this method.<>","","0-85296-531-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=140300","","Complexity theory;Learning systems;Neural networks","computational complexity;learning systems;neural nets","temporal structures;continuous backpropagation;recurrent neural networks;storage complexity;training network;weight matrix","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this context, we propose a Binary Log-linear Learning Algorithm (BLLA), which is distributed across cells and converges to a Nash equilibrium of the resource allocation game. This equilibrium is also an optimal for the resource allocation optimization problem. A key enabler for the analysis of the convergence are the proposed rules for computation of resistance of trees of perturbed Markov chains. The convergence of BLLA is proved for bounded and unbounded noise, with fixed and decreasing temperature parameter. A sufficient number of estimation samples is also provided that guarantees the convergence to an optimal state in a single cell scenario and close to an optimal state in a multi-cell scenario. We assess the performance of BLLA by extensive simulations by considering both bounded and unbounded noise cases and show that BLLA achieves higher sum data rate compared to the state-of-the-art.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2936345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807215","Distributed learning;potential games;resource allocation;power control;interference management;D2D networks","Device-to-device communication;Learning systems;Resource management;Noise measurement;Convergence;Linear programming;Interference","cellular radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","binary log-linear learning algorithm;multicell scenario;single cell scenario;perturbed Markov chains;resource allocation optimization problem;resource allocation game;Nash equilibrium;BLLA;generalized alpha-fair function;stochastic optimization problem;Device-to-Device wireless networks;resource allocation problem;distributed learning algorithm;D2D Networks;noisy-potential games","","","","41","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present an online identification method for such systems based on a generalized ADAptive LINear Element (ADALINE) neural network. It is well known ADALINE is slow in convergence which is not appropriate for online application and identification of time varying system. Two techniques are proposed to speed up convergence of learning, thus increase the capability of tracking time varying system parameters. One idea is to introduce a momentum term to the weight adjustment during convergence period. The other technique is to train the generalized ADALINE network multiple epochs with data from a sliding window of the system's input output data. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides a much faster convergence speed and better tracking of time varying parameters. The low computational complexity makes this method suitable for online system identification and real time adaptive control applications.","2378-5861","1-4244-0988-8","10.1109/ACC.2007.4282423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282423","System identification;neural network;ADALINE;tapped delay line feedback","System identification;Neural networks;Convergence;Time varying systems;Neurofeedback;Recurrent neural networks;Hopfield neural networks;Parameter estimation;Computational modeling;Computational complexity","adaptive control;learning systems;linear systems;neurocontrollers;parameter estimation;time-varying systems","linear time-varying systems;parameter estimation;generalized adaptive linear element neural network;convergence;sliding window;computational complexity;online system identification;adaptive control;ADALINE","","11","","16","","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Semiotic fusion of data from multiple sensory sources is a potential solution to the problem of landmine detection. This turns out to be significant, because notwithstanding the diversity of sensor technologies being used to attack the problem, there is no single effective landmine sensor technology. The only practical, general-purpose mine detector presently available is the trained dog. Most research into mine-detection technology seeks to emulate the dog's seemingly uncanny abilities. An ideal data-fusion system would mimic animal reaction, with the brain's perceptive power melding multiple sensory cues into an awareness of the size and location of a mine. Furthermore, the fusion process should be adaptive, with the skill at combining cues into awareness improving with experience. Electronic data-fusion systems reported in the countermine literature use conventional vector-based pattern recognition methods. Although neural nets are popular, they have never satisfactorily met the challenge. Despite years of investigation, nobody has ever found a vector space representation that reliably characterizes mine identity. This strongly suggests that the features have not been found because researchers have been looking for the wrong characteristics. The authors explore the feasibility of applying inductive learning to the problem of mine sensor-fusion.","1062-922X","0-7803-4053-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1997.637344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=637344","","Engines;Detectors;Laboratories;Pattern recognition;Landmine detection;Animals;Space technology;Instruments;Control systems;Diversity reception","weapons;learning by example;learning systems;sensor fusion;military systems;pattern recognition;symbol manipulation;military computing","landmine detection;inductive learning;fusion engine;symbols;symbol systems;semiotic data fusion;multiple sensory sources;animal reaction;brain perceptive power;multiple sensory cues;mine size awareness;mine location awareness;electronic data fusion systems;vector space representation;neural nets","","1","","33","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For maximum versatility of such motion patterns, they should be easily and efficiently adaptable for situations beyond those for which the motion was originally designed. In this work, we show how a challenging minigolf-like task can be efficiently learned by the robot using a basic hitting motion model and a task-specific adaptation of the hitting parameters: hitting speed and hitting angle. We propose an approach to learn the hitting parameters for a minigolf field using a set of provided examples. This is a non-trivial problem since the successful choice of hitting parameters generally represent a highly non-linear, multi-valued map from the situation-representation to the hitting parameters. We show that by limiting the problem to learning one combination of hitting parameters for each input, a high-performance model of the hitting parameters can be learned using only a small set of training data. We compare two statistical methods, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) in the context of inferring hitting parameters for the minigolf task.

In the recent years, deep learning (DL) has been introduced into AMC due to its outstanding identification performance. However, it is almost impossible to implement previously proposed DL-based AMC algorithms without large number of labeled samples, while there are generally few labeled sample and large unlabel samples in the realistic communication scenarios. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning (TL)-based semi-supervised AMC (TL-AMC) in a zero-forcing aided multiple-input and multiple-output (ZF-MIMO) system. TL-AMC has a novel deep reconstruction and classification network (DRCN) structure that consists of convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlabeled samples flow from CAE for modulation signal reconstruction, while labeled samples are fed into CNN for AMC. Knowledge is transferred from the encoder layer of CAE to the feature layer of CNN by sharing their weights, in order to avoid the ineffective feature extraction of CNN under the limited labeled samples. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of TL-AMC. In detail, TL-AMC performs better than CNN-based AMC under the limited samples. What's more, when compared with CNN-based AMC trained on massive labeled samples, TL-AMC also achieved the similar classification accuracy at the relative high SNR regime.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2020.2992128","Project Funded by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor; Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Jiangsu High-level Talent; Six Top Talents Program of Jiangsu; 1311 Talent Plan of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9085414","Automatic modulation classification;deep learning;convolutional neural network;transfer learning;multiple-input and multiple-output","Modulation;MIMO communication;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Equalizers","convolutional neural nets;cooperative communication;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;modulation;pattern classification;signal reconstruction;telecommunication computing","deep learning;AMC algorithms;generally few labeled sample;large unlabel samples;realistic communication scenarios;transfer learning-based semisupervised AMC;TL-AMC;deep reconstruction;unlabeled samples;modulation signal reconstruction;CNN-based AMC;massive labeled samples;semisupervised automatic modulation classification;ZF-MIMO systems;noncooperative communication systems;communications scenarios","","10","","46","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

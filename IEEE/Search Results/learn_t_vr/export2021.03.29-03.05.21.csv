So far teaching can be monitored by video, document camera or screen recordings or by a coach. This creates hard to edit video content. Also static questionnaires are used for outcome monitoring and problem solving purposes. This paper presents a new approach using dynamic HTML5 web pages with JavaScript enabling creating editable and searchable open source content on the fly in real time during lecture. Data can easily be transferred from the web page to data processing tools. This allows explorations by students. Based on this automated problem generation and solving is shown in an example of root mean square voltage calculation. Results can be sent to a server to implement a live feedback system. All data and programs are embedded in the web document. Therefore it is much easier to reuse content, evaluate style and improve lectures increasing efficiency of teaching.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-3191-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826079","Web based teaching;live feed back system;e-learning","Education;Web pages;Equations;Mathematical model;Laboratories;Servers;Electrical engineering","computer aided instruction;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;hypermedia markup languages;Internet;teaching","interactive tools;electrical engineering teaching;outcomes based teaching;outcomes based learning;teaching monitoring;video monitoring;document camera;screen recordings;static questionnaires;outcome monitoring;problem solving purposes;dynamic HTML5 Web pages;JavaScript;editable open source content;searchable open source content;data processing tools;automated problem generation;root mean square voltage calculation;live feedback system;Web document;lecture improvement;teaching efficiency","","","","11","","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human being is assumed to solve a problem through four processes: exploration process (EP), decision process (DP), behavior process (BP) and learning process (LP). We call the processes as human being's capability for solving problems. In this paper, we try to solve navigation problems by transferring this human being's capability into a mobile robot. Firstly, in the exploration process, the mobile robot collects the environment information and builds the map using the method called 'graph'. Secondly, in the decision process, the mobile robot selects a proper action on the basis of the percepted information and the generated 'graph'. Thirdly, in the behavior process, the selected action is implemented in accordance with the output of the FIS (fuzzy inference system). Finally, in the learning process, the parameters of 'graph' are updated via repeated implementing. We show that this method is promising for the mobile navigation problems through a number of simulations.","","0-7803-8730-9","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432325","","Fuzzy systems;Humans;Motion planning;Mobile robots;Mechanical engineering;Fuzzy control;Electronic mail;Control systems;Instruments;Navigation","fuzzy reasoning;mobile robots;navigation;learning systems;graph theory","map building;map localization;graph method;fuzzy inference system;human being;exploration process;decision process;behavior process;learning process;mobile robot;environment information;percepted information;mobile navigation","","","","9","","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This eliminates the need to instrument the vehicle with Pitot tubes and mechanical vanes, reducing associated cost, weight, maintenance requirements and likelihood of catastrophic mechanical failures. The system is trained to clone the behaviour of Pitot-tube measurements on thousands of instrumented simulated and real flights, and does not require a vehicle aerodynamics model. We demonstrate that safe guidance and navigation is possible in executing complex maneuvers in the presence of wind gusts without relying on airspeed sensors.

A mini-project in this context is a rather simple digital circuit which is utilized as a vehicle to transfer methods and knowledge to the students. Each mini-project has a practical application which can be understood easily and is implemented as an experiment on a special educational circuit board, GALEX, with an in-system programmable logic device, ispGAL22V10. The tool for design, synthesis and simulation is the evaluation version of the design environment, LOG/iC2. All lectures are held preferably in the laboratory with one PC and one GALEX board for each student. After presentation of the relevant theory in the lecture, each student has to design his own circuit for the lecture related mini-project. Hardware implementation is verified by external measurement. It is obvious that the systematic approach requires a design for testability from the very beginning. As a consequence, validation of all results is necessary and possible. Test vectors stored in a file must be used or even enhanced at every step of the design process. Students learn how to use all necessary hardware and software tools during the first mini-project in the very first lecture.

What the student can learn is the teacher's horizontal brush position trajectory, his normal pushing force against a virtual paper, and the distance between the teacher's brush and the virtual paper. Recognizing that it is impossible to display both the normal force information and the normal position information at the same time, we have implemented two methods of skill display: one is to use the haptic display device for displaying the position information, and the other is to use it for displaying the force information.

Haptic feedback has been proposed as a means to provide additional guidance cues that might improve training efficacy; however, recent studies have identified drawbacks to haptic guidance, including reliance on guidance forces and an inability to distinguish between forces that are part of the virtual environment and those that communicate task completion strategies. Recently, we proposed a novel approach to providing haptic guidance that separates task and guidance forces. We used a kinesthetic haptic interface to communicate task forces and a spatially separated tactile skin-stretch device to transmit guidance forces. Our experiments showed that feed-forward control using this paradigm was effective for improving performance in a trajectory following task. In this paper, we explore the potential for spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance to train a user to optimally control an inverted pendulum system. We present and execute a task and training protocol designed to determine whether error-based haptic feedback provided cutaneously can accelerate learning of a task, and whether participants can retain or transfer task skills even after guidance is no longer present. We found that subject performance improved while spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance was active. Despite this finding, performance in the pendulum balancing task was not affected once the haptic assistance was removed.","2324-7355","978-1-7281-0234-4","10.1109/HAPTICS45997.2020.ras.HAP20.11.2032900c","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086314","","","feedforward;haptic interfaces;pendulums;virtual reality","spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance;virtual sensorimotor task;haptic devices;virtual environments;guidance cues;guidance forces;kinesthetic haptic interface;task forces;spatially separated tactile skin-stretch device;error-based haptic feedback;haptic assistance;multimodal feedback;feed-forward control;inverted pendulum system","","","","27","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Training tasks are presented as a 3D game which captures children's attention and more effective visual motor integration (VMI) is anticipated than traditional paper materials. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the prototype. We also report a comparative study on handwriting performance of twenty participants grouped into four categories by education types (special vs. typical) and haptic devices (Phantom Omni™ vs. Novint Falcon™). As a result, we observed that the children quickly adjusted themselves to the system, and they sustained engagement at the word-writing tasks without any intervention. Results also showed improvements in tracing precision on the HAT system over time. Details of the results and lessons learned from the study are discussed.","","978-1-4799-0088-6","10.1109/WHC.2013.6548469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548469","Haptics;handwriting;children;skill;training;game;visual motor integration;VMI;dysgraphia","Haptic interfaces;Writing;Training;Games;Force;Educational institutions","computer aided instruction;force feedback;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces","Haptics Assisted Training system;HAT system;children handwriting;force feedback workstation;handwriting skill transfer;handwriting skill improvement;handwriting training system;special education classroom;local school district;occupational therapy;user hand guidance;stroke sequence;handwriting data;pen stroke;shapes;drawing;3D game;children attention;visual motor integration;VMI;handwriting performance;typical education;haptic device;Phantom Omni;Novint Falcon;word-writing task;tracing precision","","1","","21","","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although an introduction to PID control is referenced in many textbooks, practical PID tuning techniques applicable to the manufacturing field have not yet been established. As a result PID controllers are often tuned through the experience and intuition of technical staff and operators. In this paper, we introduce a basic PID control lecture outline which avoids complex numerical formulas. In our lectures, trainees can visually learn PID control using a PID Excel simulator, able to simulate process behavior in the case of control parameters changes.Generally, PID tuning techniques are divided into two categories; open-loop and closed-loop types. In the open-loop type, a step response test is required for PID tuning. From this test, the process gain Kp, dead time L and the time constant T are obtained to determine the PID parameters. In practice, step response tests are rarely implemented in the manufacturing field, due to their direct disturbance to production activity. As an alternative method, PID parameters can be determined through consistent oscillation using proportional control alone in a closed loop. However, as consistent oscillation potentially damages the plant facility, this PID tuning method is also not accessible in the field. Therefore, we propose a practical PID tuning method using damped oscillation generated by proportional control. We believe that in light of advanced automatic PID tuning systems utilizing AI technology being introduced in the near future, current service business development in this sector has a tendency to hide the underlying basic technology. To prevent the future industry from becoming blind to basic process control technology, we aim to contribute to the transfer of PID parameters tuning techniques to technical staff and operators working in plants.","1948-3457","978-1-7281-1164-3","10.1109/ICCA.2019.8900005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900005","","Tuning;PD control;PI control;Process control;Manufacturing;Oscillators;Education","computer aided instruction;control engineering education;control system analysis computing;control system synthesis;feedback;manufacturing systems;process control;production engineering computing;spreadsheet programs;three-term control;tuning","practical PID tuning method;advanced automatic PID tuning systems;basic process control technology;PID parameters;technical staff;basic feedback control education;proportional-integral-derivative control;practical PID tuning techniques;manufacturing field;result PID controllers;basic PID control lecture outline;PID Excel simulator;control parameters changes;closed-loop types;open-loop type","","","","12","","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In SWE the objectives are to apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to the procedural and object-oriented C# programming skills in order to implement code with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this laboratory the GUI allows the user to enter the values that represent the coefficients of a polynomial. The results of the GUI return whether the polynomial represents a stable or unstable system. In CCS the objectives are modeling the physical system and applying the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to analyze the closed loop system performance. In this lab students determine the mathematical model for an antenna azimuth position control system. They then apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to find all proportional gains for the controllers that meet certain performance requirements for the antenna position control system.

We call the processes as human being's capability for solving problems. We try to solve navigation problems by transferring this human being's capability into a mobile robot. Firstly, in the exploration process, the mobile robot collects the environment information and builds the map using the method called 'graph'. Secondly, in the decision process, the mobile robot selects a proper action on the basis of the percepted information and the generated 'graph'. Thirdly, in the behavior process, the selected action is implemented in accordance with the output of the FIS (fuzzy inference system). Finally, in the learning process, the parameters of 'graph' are updated via repeated implementing.

An ATM network is a high-speed packet-switching network for the data transmission layer of B-ISDN (broadband integrated services digital network) which provides multimedia services, including voice, data and video. Service quality control is one of the most crucial issues in realizing a flexible ATM network. It is a challenging research task to build an efficient network controller that can control the network traffic even when the precise characteristics of the source traffic are not known and the service quality requirements change over time. The proposed ATM network controller is flexible in function and simple in implementation because neural networks using backpropagation learn the relations between the offered traffic and service qualities. A training data selection method called leaky pattern tables is proposed for learning the accurate relations. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated by simulation of a basic call regulation model.<>","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=118589","","ISDN;Learning systems;Neural networks;Packet switching;Virtual computers","ISDN;learning systems;neural nets;packet switching;virtual machines","ATM communications network control;neural network;learning control method;service quality control;high-speed packet-switching network;B-ISDN;broadband integrated services digital network;multimedia services;network traffic;source traffic;backpropagation;leaky pattern tables;accurate relations;basic call regulation model","","25","1","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data obtained from experimental set is analyzed in the MATLAB program installed on the server. Similarly, MATLAB Web server (MWS) software is used to send and receive data over the Internet. Since all operation steps are executed from the server, clients do not need any special hardware or software unit. Thus, the system developed has an independent structure for the clients. Remotely located clients can operate and control the motor and conduct the experiment. Additionally, real laboratory environment and the experimental set can be monitored on the client computerpsilas screen while the experiment is being operated.

The main goal is to create for the user the illusion that the surrounding objects are covered by small sound continuously emitting sources in a particular and sustained way. Therefore, a virtual acoustic world is generated, where a physical object emit sounds from all the coordinates of its surface.

Simulation softwares are tools to support learning that facilitate the understanding of the concepts, but do not provide expertise to analyze and to build real systems with sensors, actuators, noise and offset. The didactic control benches seek to overcome this limitation, but are expensive and usually do not have great flexibility. The use of simple electrical circuits favors the concepts understanding to engineering students in the electricity area. The buck converter has an RLC circuit in the output, which means the control analysis can be studied from this circuit. The controller design is more complex because it involves the use of actuators. However, even for a lay student in Power Electronics, can be performed an assembly for the buck converter control is provided for the driver to the inverter switches. In this way, the student can browse concepts related to dynamic model, transient response, disturbance rejection and controller design without a field of Power Electronics.

But laboratory equipment can be expensive and students cannot take it with them to use it everywhere and at any time like a laptop computer or tablet. MoMoViLab provides a cloud solution for this issue by transferring experiments from the laboratory into a web browser. It follows the three principles of easy usability, modularity and scalability. MoMoViLab is designed to collaborate with common learning platforms like Moodle [1] or ILIAS [2]. The user interface only provides the functionality which is needed to carry out a specific experiment. Simulations are server-based, therefore no software has to be installed on students' devices and performance requirements are kept low. New graphical display elements, editors and simulation software can easily be included into the system. Due to its modularity, multiple instances of simulation servers can run on different (virtual) machines in a cloud infrastructure to be able to handle highly changing demands. MoMoViLab can start or shut down virtual machines automatically, depending on the current or estimated future workload.","","978-1-5386-9114-4","10.1109/EWME.2018.8629489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629489","","Cloud computing;Integrated circuit modeling;Web servers;Linear systems;Browsers;Virtual machining","circuit simulation;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;graphical user interfaces;laboratories;mobile computing;student experiments;virtual machines","MoMoViLab;mobile virtual lab;electronic circuit;cloud based modular lab;student experiment;learning platforms;usability;Web browser;virtual machines;cloud infrastructure;simulation servers;simulation software;user interface;output signals","","","","14","","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A web based tool for teaching hardware design based on the plain simple hardware description language","K. Becker","Technical University of Hamburg, Germany","2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)","5 Jun 2014","2014","","","88","93","In this paper, a new online learning tool is presented. The goal is to improve the learning experience for designing hardware on register transfer level (RTL)-level by facilitating collaboration and allowing a more agile development cycle. It also enables the inspection of the learning process of the students. When students have to learn RTL hardware-design, usually either Verilog or VHDL are used as hardware description language. Those languages do not just have an unfamiliar syntax and programming paradigm for the students (they are not sequential, but rather describe the wiring of components), they also come with complex tools. During the hands-on part of the lecture, a lot of time is spent in learning the functions (and bugs) of each tool involved. It also happens that VHDL was originally designed for a different purpose and thus accepts input that is not necessarily fit for synthesis for FPGAs, which are primarily used as target for those hardware designs. Much to the frustration of the students, it is also rather easy to create a mismatch between what the simulation does and how the design behaves on the actual hardware. This does not only result in a highly unsatisfying learning experience, as ”learning” is mostly about understanding the tools and their output, but it also distracts from the real goal of learning how to properly design hardware. A novel programming language called PSHDL, the ”plain simple hardware description language”, keeps the parallelism paradigm of VHDL and Verilog, but provides a significantly improved workflow. This workflow and its features are outlined in this paper. The improvements are not just for the student side, but also allow the teacher to take a direct look at the students' progress and learning path. This information could then be used to improve the whole learning experience.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-3191-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826073","","Syntactics;Semantics;Hardware;Light emitting diodes;Registers;Programming;Computer languages","computer aided instruction;electronic engineering education;hardware description languages;Internet;software prototyping;teaching","Web based tool;hardware design teaching;plain simple hardware description language;online learning tool;register transfer level-level;agile development cycle;learning process inspection;RTL hardware-design;Verilog;VHDL;learning experience;programming language;PSHDL;student progress;learning path","","1","","10","","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, a 6-DOF UR-5 industrial robot arm is equipped with sensors to observe the welding process. Human welder operates a virtualized welding torch, whose motion is tracked/recorded. A correlation between the welding current and welding speed controlled by human welder is proposed for GTAW pipe welding with specified welding conditions. Satisfactory welds with consistent penetration are generated in welding experiments under different welding currents. It is also concluded that for top part of the pipe welding, instead of manipulating a full set of welding parameters, adjusting welding speed is sufficient to generate satisfactory welds.

Although they show their strengths in blending the person and try-on clothing image and synthesizing the dis-occluded regions, their results for complex-posed persons are often unsatisfactory due to the limitations in their geometry deformation and texture-preserving capacity. To address these challenges, we propose CloTH-VTON+ for seamlessly integrating the image-based deep learning methods and the strength of the 3D model in shape deformation. Specifically, a fully automatic pipeline is developed for 3D clothing model reconstruction and deformation using a reference human model: first, the try-on clothing is matched to the target clothing regions in the simple shaped reference human model, and then the 3D clothing model is reconstructed. The reconstructed 3D clothing model can generate a very natural pose and shape transfer, retaining the textures of clothes. A clothing refinement network further refines the alignment, eliminating the misalignment due to the errors in human pose estimation and 3D deformation. The deformed clothing images are combined utilizing conditional generative networks to in-paint the dis-occluded areas and blend them all. Experiments on an existing benchmark dataset demonstrate that CloTH-VTON+ generates higher quality results in comparison to the state-of-the-art VTON systems and CloTH-VTON. CloTH-VTON+ can be incorporated into extended applications such as multi-pose guided and Video VTON.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059701","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354778","Online fashion;virtual try-on;hybrid approach;3D clothing reconstruction;generative network model","Clothing;Three-dimensional displays;Strain;Two dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Shape;Image reconstruction","clothing;computer graphics;feature extraction;image classification;image reconstruction;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);pose estimation;solid modelling;virtual reality","clothing image;geometry deformation;texture-preserving capacity;image-based deep learning methods;target clothing regions;simple shaped reference human model;clothing refinement network;deformed clothing images;hybrid image-based virtual try-on system;CloTH-VTON+;human pose estimation","","","","73","CCBY","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

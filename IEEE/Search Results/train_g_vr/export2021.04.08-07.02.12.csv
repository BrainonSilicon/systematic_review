Smartphones offer such low cost and easily available human-robot interface (HRI) controlling robots with tilt gestures. However, tilt gestures are not used in the more commonly available UGV control devices, such as joystick and button based gamepads. Tilt gestures have not been studied in terms of their effectiveness for controlling UGVs. If they are effective, then the low cost and high availability of smartphones running apps such as ROS Control can make a huge change in the world of HRI and control devices for UGV for the developing world. They can be ruggedized and are low cost, and more familiar to the general populace - which are factors that can help the adoption of robotics in India. This research explores the ease of use and effectiveness in controlling a UGV by benchmarking a tilt-based HRI (on the ROS Control app) with the more established joystick and button based HRI on a gamepad. A 40-person usability study using both devices in Gazebo, a robotic simulated environment, was conducted. Performance metrics (time on task and lane deviations) were measured, to indicate effectiveness. However, the statistical analysis conducted using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test shows a significant difference in the use of both the input devices in controlling a UGV favoring the gamepad. However, most of the participants report the tilt based app as more controllable and highly usable.","","978-1-5090-5838-9","10.1109/ISPCC.2017.8269699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8269699","Unmanned ground vehicle;Human Robot Interaction;Smart-Phone App","Robots;Input devices;Usability;Task analysis;Land vehicles;Training;Mobile communication","control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;interactive devices;mobile computing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;remotely operated vehicles;smart phones;statistical analysis;user interfaces","comparative empirical usability assessment;HRI input devices;mobile robot;Unmanned Ground Vehicle;free smartphone app;human-robot interface;tilt gestures;UGV control devices;button based gamepads;ROS Control app;40-person usability study;robotic simulated environment;performance metric;Wilcoxon Signed Rank test;statistical analysis","","1","","12","","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most machine learning techniques, human motor behavior is modeled as a generic stochastic process. However, the integration of a priori knowledge about underlying system structures can provide insights on otherwise unobservable intrinsic states that yield the superior prediction performance and increased generalization capabilities. Methods: We present a novel method for modeling human motor behavior that explicitly includes a neuroscientifically supported model of human motor control, in which the dynamics of the human arm are modeled by a mechanical impedance that tracks a latent desired trajectory. We adopt a Bayesian setting by defining Gaussian process (GP) priors for the impedance elements and the latent desired trajectory. This enables exploitation of a priori human arm impedance knowledge for regression of interaction forces through inference of a latent desired human trajectory. Results: The method is validated using simulated data, with particular focus on effects of GP prior parameterization and intention estimation capabilities. The superior prediction performance is shown with respect to a naive GP prior. An experiment with human participants evaluates generalization capabilities and effects of training data sparsity. Conclusion: We derive the correlations of an impedance-based GP model of human motor behavior that exploits a priori knowledge. Significance: The model effectively predicts interaction forces by inferring a latent desired human trajectory in previously observed as well as unobserved regions of the input space.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2018.2890710","ERC Starting; Control based on Human Models; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599006","Bayesian modeling;Gaussian processes;human motor control;human motor intention;human robot interaction;impedance;kernel structure","Impedance;Trajectory;Task analysis;Robots;Gaussian processes;Correlation;Motor drives","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;human-robot interaction;regression analysis","nonphysical interaction;human motor intention;human-robot interaction tasks;generic stochastic process;neuroscientifically supported model;human motor control;a priori human arm impedance knowledge;latent desired human trajectory;intention estimation capabilities;impedance-based GP model;human motor behavior;impedance-based Gaussian processes;Bayesian setting","Adult;Algorithms;Arm;Computer Simulation;Electric Impedance;Female;Humans;Intention;Male;Models, Biological;Movement;Normal Distribution;Psychomotor Performance;Young Adult","1","","53","Traditional","1 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The interface works in either an elastic tilt mode or an isometric balance mode offering different equilibrioceptive feedback to the user. Interested in how different levels of equilibrioceptive feedback influence the usability of this interface, a formal user study was conducted comparing the two modes in both separated and combined pitch and yaw travel tasks. Six of 30 subjects dropped out of the experiment because of cyber-sickness and were interviewed by the experimenter. Statistical analysis of data from the remaining subjects showed that although objectively there was no significant difference between the two modes regarding training effects and task performance, subjectively most subjects preferred the elastic tilt mode because of its intuitiveness, realism, fun, and sense of presence despite the greater fatigue and after effects (e.g., loss of balance) of using it. Based on the results we suggest a general preference of elastic devices and several design guidelines to future 3D VE travel interface designers.","","978-1-4673-1205-9","10.1109/3DUI.2012.6184181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184181","Isometric and elastic;3D travel interface;leaning-based interface;board interface","Three dimensional displays;Legged locomotion;Space exploration;Sensors;Position control;Gravity;Foot","data analysis;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;virtual reality","isometric surfboard interfaces;elastic surfboard interfaces;leaning-based travel;silver surfer comics;leaning-based surfboard interface;3D virtual environments;elastic tilt mode;isometric balance mode;equilibrioceptive feedback;cyber-sickness;statistical data analysis;3D VE travel interface designers","","5","","27","","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We attempt to address these challenges by proposing a dialogue management architecture that has an abstracted view of the world but yet is able to focus on relevant parts of the ontology at runtime. Specifically, we train a sub-domain identifier neural network that learns which features are relevant to the current turn and the immediate future, thus filtering out irrelevant information from the ontology and consequently the belief space at each dialogue turn. We then train a policy network that needs: a) to adapt to the sub-domain identifier's output; and b) to learn what information will carry over from previous turns and when it needs to be updated. We evaluate our method on a large information-seeking ontology that contains latent sub-domains. Our results in simulation and a small human trial show that the sub-domain identifier is able to generalise to unseen domains and achieve performance on par with a multi-domain dialogue manager where each sub-domain is carefully defined (golden standard).","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461754","Spoken Dialogue Management;Multiple Domains;Dialogue Policy;Policy Network","Ontologies;Electronics packaging;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Face;Neural networks","human computer interaction;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;neural nets;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","trained policy models;sub-domain identifier neural network;abstracted view;dialogue management architecture;multidomain dialogue systems;scalable information-seeking multidomain dialogue;multidomain dialogue manager;unseen domains;latent sub-domains;information-seeking ontology;policy network;dialogue turn;irrelevant information","","","","17","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to automatically recognize hand gesture from color and depth sequences, where noise and occlusion are common problems, we extract steric Haar-like features to robustly represent the complicated spatial information of the hand. A novel feature selection approach, which takes the advantage of class separability measure, is employed to effectively ferret out the most discriminative features. We also use sparse coding method to encode these features so that it is less prone to over-fitting even when only limited amount of training data are available. Generally speaking, spare Steric Haar-like (SSH) features are efficient to compute by using the self-padding integral volume, in addition to the advantage of robustness to noise and occlusion. These crucial features significantly improve the performance of tracking and classification.

But in many real-world scenarios, the agent is supplied with extremely sparse or even no rewards which makes learning fail and fall into ineffective exploration. In psychology, shaping is a method of animal training by reinforcing successive approximations of rewards to finally achieve the desired complex behavior. Inspired by this phenomenon of animal learning and reward as a signal in neuroscience, in this paper we solve the sparse reward problem by constructing a reward generator to generate inner-rewards and guide the agent learning control policies with deep neural networks. The proposed learning-based reward shaping does not require specific domain knowledge, but rather enable the agent to learn how to generate inner rewards to guide itself in any scenarios online jointly with the actual reinforcement learning process. To validate the performance in complex sparse reward problems, the proposed approach is evaluated in a challenging scenario, Football Academy in Google Research Football Environment, a newly released reinforcement learning environment with physics-based 3D simulator, instead of maze environments or grid world that are commonly used in research which are not sufficiently challenging. We compare the performance of our inner-rewards approach with two reinforcement algorithms (PPO and ICM + PPO). Experimental results show that our method improves the learning performance in terms of speed and quality, and also enables the agent to learn generalized skills applied to novel scenarios.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207302","Reinforcement learning;Football game;Reward shaping;Inner-rewards","Reinforcement learning;Games;Sports;Computational modeling;Neuroscience;Task analysis;Markov processes","computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","animal training;animal learning;reward generator;learning-based reward shaping;complex sparse reward problems;Google Research Football Environment;reinforcement learning environment;sparse reward games;reward signal frames;adaptive inner-reward shaping;goal-directed learning;psychology;neuroscience;agent learning control policies;deep neural networks;Football Academy;physics-based 3D simulator;maze environments","","","","29","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These agents use the pixels of the screen as inputs and changing them could harm their performance. In this work, we evaluate agents' sensibility to texture changes. The agents are trained to play a First-Person Shooter game and then are presented to different versions of the same scenario, in which the only difference among them is texture changes. As the testbed, we use a ViZDoom scenario with a static monster that should be killed by the agent. Four agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks in four different scenarios. Then, every agent is tested in all four scenarios. We show that although every agent can learn the behaviors to win the game when playing the same version in which it was trained, they cannot generalize to all other versions. Only in one case, the agent had a good performance in a different scenario. Most of the time, the agent moved randomly or just stood still, and shot continuously, indicating that it could not understand the current screen. Even when the background textures were kept the same, the agent could not identify the enemy. Thus, to ensure proper behavior, an agent needs to be retrained not only if the problem changes, but also when only the visual aspects of the problem are modified.","2159-6662","978-1-7281-8432-6","10.1109/SBGames51465.2020.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9291626","autonomous agents;deep reinforcement learning;digital games;first-person shooter games","Games;Training;Neural networks;Task analysis;Autonomous agents;Visualization;Unmanned aerial vehicles","computer games;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image texture","FPS games;graphical updates;modern digital games;PC game versions;autonomous agents;convolutional neural networks;first-person shooter game;ViZDoom scenario;background textures;Deep Q-network agent sensibility","","","","31","","25 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we present an algorithm for learning by demonstration in which the teacher operates in two phases. The teacher first demonstrates the task to the learner. The teacher next critiques learner performance of the task. This critique is used by the learner to update its control policy. In our implementation we utilize a 1-Nearest Neighbor technique which incorporates both training dataset and teacher critique. Since the teacher critiques performance only, they do not need to guess at an effective critique for the underlying algorithm. We argue that this method is particularly well-suited to human teachers, who are generally better at assigning credit to performances than to algorithms.

Inferring the forces applied to the person's body by the garment might enable a robot to provide more effective assistance and give the robot insight into what the person feels. However, complex mechanics govern the relationship between the robot's end effector and these forces. Using a physics-based simulation and data-driven methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of inferring forces across a person's body using only end effector measurements. Specifically, we present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that at each time step takes a 9-dimensional input vector of force, torque, and velocity measurements from the robot's end effector and outputs a force map consisting of hundreds of inferred force magnitudes across the person's body. We trained and evaluated LSTMs on two tasks: pulling a hospital gown onto an arm and pulhng shorts onto a leg. For both tasks, the LSTMs produced force maps that were similar to ground truth when visualized as heat maps across the limbs. We also evaluated their performance in terms of root-mean-square error. Their performance degraded when the end effector velocity was increased outside the training range, but generalized well to limb rotations. Overall, our results suggest that robots could learn to infer the forces people feel during robot-assisted dressing, although the extent to which this will generalize to the real world remains an open question.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989718","","Force;Clothing;End effectors;Force measurement;Estimation;Legged locomotion","clothing;end effectors;force control;human-robot interaction;mean square error methods;service robots;velocity control","applied forces;robot-assisted dressing;garment;complex mechanics;physics-based simulation;data-driven methods;long short-term memory network;LSTM;9-dimensional input vector;velocity measurements;force map;inferred force magnitudes;hospital gown;heat maps;root-mean-square error;end effector velocity;training range","","12","","24","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing circuit diagram simulation tools are mostly based on GUI interface and rely on users to click or drag icons with mouse, which requires them to be familiar with the software and distracts a great deal of their attention from the circuit diagram itself. Although a lot of previous works have devoted to designing algorithmic solution to recognize hand-drawn circuit diagrams automatically, there still exists strict constraints on users' drawing habits and stroke orders. In order to address these inconveniences, this paper proposes a novel sketch recognition algorithm named LS4D. It uses graph to model the input strokes and their relationships, and leverages cycles by local strokes to detect some circuit components. Theoretical derivations have demonstrated that LS4D can efficiently recognize diagrams with different drawing styles and arbitrary stroke orders. To furthermore illustrate the practical value of the proposed approach, we construct a prototype of pen-based circuit diagram system based on LS4D , which enables users to draw circuit diagrams directly on the digital screen without any other restriction. An experiment of 158 samples collected from 17 users is conducted on the designed platform. Our approach has achieved 93.04% recognition accuracy and overall 4.53 from a 5-scale user satisfaction rating, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods numerically. It is shown that the same approach can also be generalized to many other sketch recognition applications with minor modifications.

"A Review and Evaluation of Engineering Education in Transition","L. C. Wilcox; M. S. Wilcox","Wilcox Group, Palm Coast, FL, USA; NA","2010 IEEE Transforming Engineering Education: Creating Interdisciplinary Skills for Complex Global Environments","15 Jul 2010","2010","","","1","24","This paper revisits success stories of past projects aimed at education transition through integrated curricula, multidisciplinary projects, and national/global technological issues. Successful programs depended heavily on interaction between educators and the professional engineers in the work force. Political priorities, both state and national, have played a major role in determining scope and success. Global issues are essential in most curricula since economic factors alone present major integrated components that engineers must understand. There are extraordinary opportunities, obstacles, and dangers ahead because we now are embroiled in the arena of ""knowledge management,"" where massive information interconnections are expanding among businesses, universities, and political systems. This will create problems of privacy, ethics, and value in the absence of an honest and rigorous work force. Although we have made great progress in electrical engineering curricular transitioning, there is much to do, as Dr. Vartan Gregorian (Carnegie Corp.) predicts: ""Laser communications, nuclear power, biotechnology, networked computers, and the like are precisely shaping our habits of thought and desire. They have become a dominant source of our culture, even to changing the very paradigms of knowledge. Rapidly evolving global communications are bringing social changes that are so complex and far-reaching they are not amenable to easy understanding."" As education moved into the 21st century, business and society in general recognized the significance of ""learning anywhere, anytime."" Enabled through the powerful mechanism of communications and networking, education and industry quickly recognized the need for a new trained work force. Education saw the extraordinary advantage of combining their faculty with visiting faculty from industry, forming an integrated and multidisciplinary team. Transforming Engineering Education has been led by electrical engineering departments with support from IEEE and corporations like IBM. During this historic transition, input from students became increasingly important as they examined new careers combining fields like engineering, medicine, health care, business, science, and management, to name a few. Lifelong learning has long been a core priority for IEEE and IBM. Lifelong learning and ""anywhere and anytime"" courses clearly will get better because they will have the support of an extraordinary, dynamic network that is the platform for implementation. Interactions between people and programs are expanding understanding of terms like ""knowledge management and computer simulations"" driven by common sense evaluations and the continual search for and emphasis on the meaning or role of ""wisdom"" in these gigantic digital warehouses of data. Michael Crichton continually reminds us of the fragility of networks susceptible to misuse or misdirection resulting in catastrophic consequences for society. In this paper, three transition-based programs are reviewed: 1. A long-term university/corporation agreement involving technical management and product research 2. Creation of a unique College of Integrated Science and Technology at James Madison University in Virginia 3. A major governor-sponsored West Virginia technology bill aimed at statewide support of economic development and educational change implemented under Senate Bill 547. These programs had in common the following goals: for our students - the competitive advantage for the jobs of the future. for our educators - the technological resources for uncompromised quality of content and access.","","978-1-4244-6042-7","10.1109/TEE.2010.5508832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508832","","Engineering education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Power generation economics;Knowledge management;Electrical engineering;Educational programs;Economic forecasting;Privacy;Ethics","continuing professional development;educational courses;engineering education;knowledge management","engineering education;education transition;political priorities;global issues;knowledge management;lifelong learning;anywhere-and-anytime courses;transition-based programs","","3","","22","","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We base our approach on Movement Primitives (MP), as MPs provide a framework for modelling complex movements and introduce useful operations on the movements, such as generalization to novel situations, time scaling, and others. Usually, MPs are trained with imitation learning, where an expert demonstrates the trajectories. However, MPs used in physical interaction either require additional learning approaches, e.g., reinforcement learning, or are based on handcrafted solutions. Our goal is to learn and generate movements for physical interaction that are learned with imitation learning, from a small set of demonstrated trajectories. The Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs) framework is a recent MP approach that introduces beneficial properties, such as combination and blending of MPs, and represents the correlations present in the movement. The ProMPs provides a variable stiffness controller that reproduces the movement but it requires a dynamics model of the system. Learning such a model is not a trivial task, and, therefore, we introduce the model-free ProMPs, that are learning jointly the movement and the necessary actions from a few demonstrations. We derive a variable stiffness controller analytically. We further extent the ProMPs to include force and torque signals, necessary for physical interaction. We evaluate our approach in simulated and real robot tasks.","","978-1-4799-9994-1","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353771","","Robot sensing systems;Trajectory;Probabilistic logic;Dynamics;Robot kinematics;Force","force control;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;signal processing;torque control;variable structure systems","model-free ProMP framework;variable stiffness controller;imitation learning;reinforcement learning;complex movement modelling;kinematic trajectories;complex problem;physical interaction;model-free probabilistic movement primitives","","9","","18","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, public gesture datasets are captured in the daily environment and existing approaches trained on these datasets achieve imprecise performance for astronaut gesture recognition. In this paper, we introduce a new astronaut gesture dataset (DSSL-Astronaut gesture dataset) and a novel hierarchical attention single-shot detector network (HA-SSD) for astronaut gesture recognition. Specifically, this dataset consists of the real and augmented images. The real images captured in the simulated space station are closed to the real images in the space station environment. Meanwhile, we utilize the Mask-RCNN model to segment the foreground image including an astronaut from real data and capture the background images of the simulated space station at different views and illuminations. Then we combine them to synthesize the augmented images. A novel HA-SSD model consists of a lightweight backbone named MobileNet and a hierarchical attention mechanism.

In contrast, humans program robotic behaviours by indicating desired object locations and poses to be achieved [5], by providing RGB images of goal configurations [19], or supplying a demonstration to be imitated [17]. None of these methods generalize across environment variations, and they convey the goal in awkward technical terms. This work proposes joint learning of natural language grounding and instructable behavioural policies reinforced by perceptual detectors of natural language expressions, grounded to the sensory inputs of the robotic agent. Our supervision is narrated visual demonstrations (NVD), which are visual demonstrations paired with verbal narration (as opposed to being silent). We introduce a dataset of NVD where teachers perform activities while describing them in detail. We map the teachers' descriptions to perceptual reward detectors, and use them to train corresponding behavioural policies in simulation. We empirically show that our instructable agents (i) learn visual reward detectors using a small number of examples by exploiting hard negative mined configurations from demonstration dynamics, (ii) develop pick-and-place policies using learned visual reward detectors, (iii) benefit from object-factorized state representations that mimic the syntactic structure of natural language goal expressions, and (iv) can execute behaviours that involve novel objects in novel locations at test time, instructed by natural language.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578830","","Visualization;Natural languages;Detectors;Grounding;Task analysis;Speech recognition;Microphones","data mining;feature extraction;human computer interaction;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;object detection;software agents","narrated visual demonstrations;pick-and-place policies;RGB images;narrated demonstrations;reward learning;hard negative mined configurations;instructable agents;perceptual reward detectors;verbal narration;robotic agent;natural language expressions;instructable behavioural policies;natural language grounding","","1","","54","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Remote robotic surgery is now expected to become a reality due to the emergence of 5G. Needle insertion is a crucial element of many robotic surgical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. During needle insertion in remote robotic surgery, there is still no guarantee that the surgeon will obtain the haptic feedback from the patient side within the stringent deadlines, even in 5G settings. This paper proposes a framework for learning by imitation as a way to predict the messages that will eventually fail to reach their destination within the required deadlines. By leveraging expert demonstrations, the Hidden Markov Model is used to encapsulate a set of expert force/torque profiles and corresponding parameters during the off-line training process. A Gaussian mixture regression is then used to reproduce a generalized version of the force/torque profile and corresponding parameters during the prediction. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. They show that our proposed framework is able to execute predictions in much less than the 1ms end-to-end latency requirement of remote robotic surgery.","2331-9860","978-1-7281-3893-0","10.1109/CCNC46108.2020.9045432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045432","Tactile internet;remote robotic surgery;fifth generation (5G);machine learning;haptic feedback","","cancer;Gaussian processes;haptic interfaces;hidden Markov models;medical robotics;regression analysis;surgery","force-torque profile;brachytherapy cancer treatment;Gaussian mixture regression;Hidden Markov model;5G remote robotic surgery;robotic surgical procedures;needle insertion;haptic feedback","","1","","18","","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior arts usually focus on preserving the character of a clothes image (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g.long sleeve shirt→arm, arm→jacket), and then determines whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothes details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a clothes warping module warps clothes image according to the generated semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to stabilize the warping process during training.Third, an inpainting module for content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer fine-details.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-7168-5","10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9156594","","Semantics;Clothing;Layout;Task analysis;Shape;Visualization;Image segmentation","clothing;image segmentation;neural nets;pose estimation;realistic images;virtual reality","image content preservation;image visual try-on aims;target clothes image;photo-realistic try-on images;human poses;ACGPN;semantic layout generation module;semantic segmentation;photorealistic virtual try-on;clothes warping module;warps clothes image;visual try-on network;Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network","","4","","50","","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional exoskeleton based on fully actuated joints can provide powerful assistance for human motion, while it is bulky requiring a large energy consumption, which limits its application. The passive and quasi-passive exoskeletons are weak in the load-carrying condition due to the lack of active actuators. The traditional underactuated exoskeleton with only one joint actuated generally has limited power assistance. As for soft exoskeleton, uncomfortable feeling resulting from the pressure generated by cable tension on muscles are unavoidable. To compensate these drawbacks, this paper presents a lower limb exoskeleton based on the cable-pulley underactuated principle. By studying the synergies of torque and power assistance at the joints and designing the control strategy, a single cable will be able to drive the hip joint and the knee joint simultaneously, which can reduce the number of actuators. Considering the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics, a biological method is utilized to evaluate the performance of the exoskeleton. Finally, the contrast simulation results demonstrate that the exoskeleton proposed in this paper can effectively provide power augmentation in load-carrying walking without interfering the human motion and the control strategy is feasible.","2152-744X","978-1-5090-6759-6","10.1109/ICMA.2017.8015881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8015881","lower limb exoskeleton;underactuated mechanism;dynamics;simulation","Exoskeletons;Hip;Knee;Torque;Mechanical cables;Legged locomotion;Pulleys","cables (mechanical);human-robot interaction;legged locomotion;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;pulleys;robot dynamics","cable-pulley underactuated lower limb exoskeleton;load-carrying augmentation;walking assistance;rehabilitation training;fully actuated joints;human motion assistance;muscle cable tension;control strategy design;hip joint;knee joint;human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics;biological method;power augmentation;load-carrying walking;robotic leg","","","","13","","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ErrP signals are particularly useful for robotics tasks because they are naturally occurring within the brain in response to an unexpected error. We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classification performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for realtime closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as offline analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened.

Tactile situation awareness system (TSAS) studies have demonstrated improved pilot and operator SA and performance in both simulated and actual flight-testing, including a study of simulated Space Shuttle guided precision approaches and landings (A/Ls) where 12 US Air Force test pilot subjects each performed 24 precision A/Ls from 50,000 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL) in a realistic medium fidelity, fixed-based Shuttle simulator with partial instrument failures, secondary visual, and arithmetic tasks to increase cognitive workload . A tactile display belt using 24 electro-mechanical tactile transducers (tactors) was worn by all subjects. The control group (n=6) used visual-only information for 16 of 24 trials; the test group (n=6) received tactile guidance cues for all 24 trials. The study results from six objective and subjective measures plus pre-and post-flight surveys showed that tactile displays decreased overall workload, improved SA, counteracted fatigue, and provided superior warning and monitoring capacity for this dynamic, complex spaceflight related task. Performance improvement results were statistically inconclusive, although operator feedback revealed that sensory input was generally intuitive and improved task learning despite degraded system, and environmental conditions. The results implied improvements in overall safety, consistency, reliability, and ease of training and operations for both this specific task and broader general applications.

"Factors That Enable and Challenge International Engineering Communication: A Case Study of a United States/British Design Team","M. R.

Research questions: How do the factors mentioned in the literature function in an international engineering project? Are there factors that enhance or constrain the work in an engineering setting that are not mentioned in previous studies? Literature review: Existing knowledge on the contextual factors that affect virtual international professional communication is mainly built on the study of the communication practices of students or business professionals who are not engineers. Results of that literature have identified factors that enhance communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include cross-cultural training, using appropriate communication technology, face-to-face communication opportunities, respect for partners, regularly scheduled meetings, a common language, a common discipline, and cross-cultural understandings though popular media). There are factors that challenge communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include differing cultural assumptions, differing cultural communication styles, US Government export control regulations, proximity and time issues, and differing levels of perceived power and influence). Methodology: This study involved observing international engineer meetings in the US and the UK and interviewing 19 engineers leading an international design team. The participants worked for the same international company with about half from the US and half in Great Britain. Results and discussion: Many of the factors identified in general professional communication studies held true for this context. But some features were unique to an engineering environment that the literature had not previously mentioned, including iplanning for and working with intercultural dispersed virtual engineering teams and that people need to consider many complexities of culture that affect communication practices. Because this study observed one team in the context of only two cultures, future research may determine whether these factors are more widely found in other teams, workplaces, and cultures. Future research may also determine the relative levels of influence of the contextual factors on international dispersed virtual engineering teams. In addition, the study of engineers learning to communicate in international settings may be illuminating.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2014.2363893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951500","Case study;dispersed virtual teams;international engineering communication","Cultural differences;Virtual groups;Global communication;Context modeling;Communications technology;Design methodology;Research initiatives","design engineering;project engineering;virtual reality","international engineering communication;United States design team;British design team;international engineering project;virtual engineering teams","","7","","18","","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to evaluate the process of typing with the tip of the tongue, eight volunteers participated in tip-of-tongue selectivity training experiments using an inductive tongue-computer interface. Performance data based on typing speed and accuracy fits a general learning model based on the power law of practice, which can be used to estimate further improvements of tongue-typing performance.

Basically, our algorithm applies the same idea with Elo rating algorithm, which considers each move in game records as a group of move patterns, and the selected move as the winner of a kind of competition among all groups on current board. However, being different from the generalized Bradley-Terry model for group competition used in Elo rating algorithm, Only-One-Victor model in our work simulates the process of making selection from a set of possible candidates by considering such process as a group of independent pairwise comparisons. We use a graph theory model to prove the correctness of Only-One-Victor model. In addition, we also apply the Minorization-Maximization (MM) to solve the optimization task. Therefore, our algorithm still enjoys many computational advantages of Elo rating algorithm, such as the scalability with high dimensional feature space.

Existing AUVs are usually not fully autonomous and generally limited to pre-planning or pre-programming tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning have been introduced into the AUV design and research to improve its autonomy. However, these methods are still difficult to apply directly to the actual AUV system because of the sparse rewards and low learning efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive reinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the advantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition, since the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running in the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further propose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human rewards and environmental rewards at the same time. We test our methods in two path following tasks-straight line and sinusoids curve following of AUV by simulating in the Gazebo platform. Our experimental results show that with our proposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner from only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from both human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better performance than that with deep interactive RL and can adapt to the actual environment by further learning from environmental rewards.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970433","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976170","Autonomous underwater vehicle;interactive reinforcement learning;deep Q network;path following","Reinforcement learning;Task analysis;Robots;Oceans;Uncertainty;Neural networks;Autonomous underwater vehicles","autonomous underwater vehicles;control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);path planning;robot programming","autonomous underwater vehicle;pre-programming tasks;actual AUV system;low learning efficiency;deep interactive reinforcement learning method;human rewards;environmental reward;deep interactive RL method;AUV learning;deep RL","","4","","32","CCBY","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these circumstances, we can leverage tactile feedback between the gripper and the environment. In this paper, we present learnable Bayes filter models that can localize robotic grippers using tactile feedback. We propose a novel observation model that conditions the tactile feedback on visual maps of the environment along with a motion model to recursively estimate the gripper's location.

To tackle this problem, many solutions have been developed which take the environment's influence on human navigation behavior into account. However, few do this in a way which seamlessly generalizes to new environments where no prior observations of pedestrians are available. In this letter, we propose a novel method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict local statistics about the direction of likely human motion. Specifically, the network takes crops of a floor plan as an input and computes a cell-wise probability distributions over directions conditioned on the direction in the last time step. These environment-aware motion models can be used to improve the performance of existing tracking algorithms. We evaluated our approach with two different existing trackers, a discrete, grid-based filter as well as a particle filter and show that using our proposed method as motion model considerably improves prediction quality in previously unseen test environments. Even though we train the CNN entirely in simulation, our experiments suggest that the learned models generalize to real pedestrian data.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2898039","Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636974","Deep Learning in Robotics and Automation;Semantic Scene Understanding;Social Human-Robot Interaction","Tracking;Hidden Markov models;Microprocessors;Computer architecture;Navigation;Predictive models;Dynamics","convolutional neural nets;human-robot interaction;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;navigation;particle filtering (numerical methods);pedestrians;robot vision;statistical distributions;target tracking","floor plan;cell-wise probability distributions;environment-aware motion models;grid-based filter;unseen test environments;environment-aware multitarget tracking;dynamic environments;pedestrians;human navigation behavior;convolutional neural networks;local statistics;human motion;mobile robotic system navigation;CNNs;particle filter;discrete filter","","1","","24","","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key finding of this work is that exploiting tactile information allows wrench-based reasoning to perform on a level with existing methods based on learning or simulation. Different from these methods, the suggested approach has no need for training data, requires little modeling effort and is computationally efficient.

In addition, this system will be powered using machine learning algorithms with the help of a publicly available repository of over five million games. This will make the user feel like he/she is playing against another human and not a machine. The existing chess systems use a variety of algorithms in order to choose its move. Most of these use tree traversals and the most common one is the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Min-max algorithm finds the best move, and alpha-beta pruning prevents it from going into branches of the game tree that cannot yield a better result than previously traversed branches. Since the tree generated in a chess game is very deep and have a lot nodes, these algorithms examine the depth only to a certain amount. Generally, these algorithms are accompanied by an opening repository which bolsters the algorithm's efficiency. Since these algorithms are too strong for a visually impaired individual, a new approach is suggested to choose the computer's move. A publicly available repository of over five million chess games played by humans will be used to train the machine, initially. When the user makes his/her move, it will be converted into text and given as input to both the Minimax and the k-NN algorithms. The moves given as output by both these algorithms are compared using an evaluation function. The move with a higher score is chosen. The game continues till a decisive result is obtained.","","978-1-5386-1887-5","10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8389758","Speech Recognition;Hidden Markov Model;Minimax model;Alpha-beta pruning;k-nearest neighbour","Games;Speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Training;Data analysis;Engines","computer games;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;speech recognition;trees (mathematics)","chess game;visually impaired individual;k-NN algorithms;speech recognition based chess system;visual chess simulators;voice commands;min-max algorithm;alpha-beta pruning;game tree;machine learning algorithms;tree traversals","","","","9","","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider contacts between a rigid body and an elastic object and address a little studied problem: the modeling and rendering of compliant twisting or rotation of the rigid body on the surface of the elastic object and the associated effects in the deformation of the elastic object. We present a unique strategy to model the contact torques applied to the rigid body and the resulted shape deformation of the elastic object. This strategy extends the general paradigm of contact and deformable modeling introduced by the authors earlier [1] so that not only contact forces but also contact torques, not only compliant translations but also compliant rotations of the rigid body, as well as the resulted deformations of the elastic object can all be simulated in a combined update rate of over lfeHz. The strategy is implemented, and the experimental results confirm its effectiveness and efficiency.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-0911-2","10.1109/IROS.2007.4398993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4398993","twisting effect;deformable object;haptic rendering;contact torque;multiple contacts","Deformable models;Haptic interfaces;Rendering (computer graphics);Graphics;Shape;Feedback;Torque;Intelligent robots;Computer science","haptic interfaces;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling","contact-deformation object modeling;graphics rendering;contact torque-twisting effect;haptic interaction;visual feedback;haptic feedback","","1","","22","","10 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An Adaptive Automated Robotic Task-Practice System for Rehabilitation of Arm Functions After Stroke","Y. Choi; J. Gordon; D. Kim; N. Schweighofer","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Robotics","5 Jun 2009","2009","25","3","556","568","We present a novel robotic task-practice system, i.e., adaptive and automatic presentation of tasks (ADAPT), which is designed to enhance the recovery of upper extremity functions in patients with stroke. We designed ADAPT in accordance with current training guidelines for stroke rehabilitation; ADAPT engages the patient intensively, actively, and adaptively in a variety of realistic functional tasks that require reaching and manipulation. A general-purpose robot simulates the dynamics of the functional tasks and presents these functional tasks to the patient. A novel tool-changing system enables ADAPT to automatically switch between the tools corresponding to the functional tasks. The control architecture of ADAPT is composed of three main components: a high-level task scheduler, a functional task model, and a low-level admittance controller. The high-level task scheduler adaptively selects the task to practice and sets the task difficulty based on the previous performance of the patients. The functional task model generates desired trajectories based on learned models of task dynamics. Tasks dynamics are modeled with receptive field weighted regression (RFWR), such that the feel of the task tools is accurately modeled, and the task difficulty can be easily adjusted. The low-level admittance controller, which is also learned with RFWR, implements the selected task trajectory for robot-patient interaction. The results of a preliminary experiment with a healthy subject demonstrate the successful operation of ADAPT.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2009.2019787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967899","Admittance controller;locally weighted learning;motor schedule;neurorehabilitation;rehabilitation robotics;stroke;upper extremity","Rehabilitation robotics;Robotics and automation;Extremities;Medical treatment;Switches;Automatic control;Admittance;Computer science;Medical robotics;Adaptive systems","diseases;electric variables control;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;regression analysis","adaptive automated robotic task-practice system;arm functions;adaptive and automatic presentation of tasks;upper extremity function;ADAPT;stroke rehabilitation;tool-changing system;low-level admittance controller;functional task model;high-level task scheduler;task dynamics;receptive field weighted regression;robot-patient interaction","","23","","54","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The learning component of the proposed controller can use an arbitrary function approximator such as a Polynomial, Radial Basis, or Neural Network to directly learn the inverse of the input-state mapping of the plant while forcing its state to track a prescribed desired trajectory. Unlike most of the existing direct adaptive or learning schemes, the nonlinear plant is not assumed to be feedback linearizable. The developed controller is subsequently applied to control the configuration of a nonholonomic differential drive robot. The simulation results of this application demonstrate a significant improvement in the tracking performance of the robot once the control input is fully learned.","2378-5861","978-1-4577-0081-1","10.1109/ACC.2011.5991033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5991033","","Trajectory;Nonlinear systems;Controllability;Jacobian matrices;Mobile robots","adaptive control;approximation theory;discrete time systems;feedback;learning systems;nonlinear control systems;robots;state-space methods","nonlinear discrete-time state-space systems;model-free learning controller;arbitrary function approximator;polynomial;radial basis;neural network;input-state mapping;direct adaptive schemes;feedback;nonholonomic differential drive robot","","1","","29","","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it breaches the intrinsic principle of this long range receding horizon strategy, and sometimes it could lead to poor control performance in some processes. A kind of fast algorithm for self-tuning GPC (FGPC) is presented by using back propagation (BP) neural networks. The algorithm involves the derivation of the GPC in a new way and the training of BP neural networks to represent nonlinear relations between the GPC controller coefficients and system open-loop parameters, control horizon, smoothing factor and control weighting factor. The method developed does not involve the Diophantine equation and avoids the matrix operation, therefore substantially alleviates the mathematical computation problems associated with the standard adaptive GPC, especially for a long control horizon. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated with a comparative simulation study.","","0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382282","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Predictive control;Neural networks;Open loop systems;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Smoothing methods;Weight control;Nonlinear equations","predictive control;adaptive control;backpropagation;open loop systems;neurocontrollers","fast algorithm;adaptive generalized predictive control;BP neural networks;back propagation neural networks;system open-loop parameters;control horizon;smoothing factor;control weighting factor","","3","","11","","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the estimation of the unknown channel coefficients and its support in OFDM systems using a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for exact inference. In a quasi-static, block-fading scenario, we employ the SBL algorithm for channel estimation and propose a joint SBL (J-SBL) and a low-complexity recursive J-SBL algorithm for joint channel estimation and data detection. In a time-varying scenario, we use a first-order autoregressive model for the wireless channel and propose a novel, recursive, low-complexity Kalman filtering-based SBL (KSBL) algorithm for channel estimation. We generalize the KSBL algorithm to obtain the recursive joint KSBL algorithm that performs joint channel estimation and data detection. Our algorithms can efficiently recover a group of approximately sparse vectors even when the measurement matrix is partially unknown due to the presence of unknown data symbols. Moreover, the algorithms can fully exploit the correlation structure in the multiple measurements.

The bounds on the asymptotic error for the learned input are exhibited via a concise proof. Simulation studies demonstrate that in the absence of input disturbances perfect tracking of the desired trajectory is achieved for nonlinear nonminimum phase plants. Further, in the presence of bounded random input disturbances, the tracking error converges to a neighborhood of zero.

The PUs must select suitable SUs as relay nodes which are expected to uphold the leasing agreement. General speaking, the SU's transmission power must fulfill the minimum and maximum power threshold levels imposed by PUs. The minimum power thresholds ensure that a satisfactory level of successful transmission can be achieved by SUs while helping to relay PUs' packets. On the other hand, the maximum power threshold ensures that SUs' interference to PUs is acceptable to PUs. In this paper, the PUs announce their requirements on minimum and maximum power threshold levels to SUs for the selection of relay nodes; while the SUs maintain their respective transmission power within the threshold level defined by PUs in order to increase their respective network performance (e.g. throughput and end-to-end delay performances). The functionalities are modeled and solved using Reinforcement Learning (RL), which determines the suitable SUs as relay nodes on the basis of the aforementioned power threshold criterion. Our preliminary simulation results show that the number of SUs that qualify as relay nodes increases with the maximum power level imposed by PU, and thus it is expected to provide PUs' and SUs' performance enhancement (e.g. throughput). It also shows that, the convergence rate of SUs' power level increases with the number of simulation iterations.","","978-1-4799-1508-8","10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6719937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719937","Spectrum leasing;relay node selection;power threshold level;interference;reinforcement learning","Cognitive radio;Relays;Interference;Learning (artificial intelligence);Conferences;Mathematical model","cognitive radio;learning (artificial intelligence);radio spectrum management;radiofrequency interference;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication computing","relay node selection;spectrum leasing;cognitive radio network;unlicensed user;channel access;network performance;leasing agreement;maximum power threshold;secondary user interference;primary user interference;transmission power;reinforcement learning;maximum power level","","1","","23","","23 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of students fit the traditional profile in terms of age and on-campus residential status. The class is consistently 60% male. The students are predominantly sophomores (41%), although all academic standings are present within this general education course. One of the main reasons given for enrolling is ""flexibility"". Roughly half of the student activity (56%) is after the traditional workday of 8 AM to 5:00 PM. Only 10% of the online activity occurs within the traditional morning hours. In a class with weekly Friday evening deadlines, there was little activity (measured by number of page requests) occurring on Saturday (5%), Friday has the bulk of the activity (27%). About 72% of the students accessed the material from home with a high-speed connection.

NN models provide good generalization performance (in terms of output signal-to-error ratio). NN modeling of digital satellite channels allows the characterization of each channel component. Neural net models represent the SSPA as a system composed of a linear complex filter followed by a nonlinear memoryless neural net followed by a linear complex filter. If the new algorithms are to be used in real systems, it is important that the algorithm designer understands their learning behavior and performance capabilities. Some simplified neural net models are analyzed in support of the simulation results. The analysis provides some theoretical basis for the usefulness of NNs for modeling satellite channels and amplifiers.

A radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to approximate the output PDF of the system. Such a neural network consists of a number of weights and corresponding basis functions. Using such an approximation, the dynamics of the original stochastic system can be expressed as the dynamics between the control input and the weights of the RBF neural network. The task of output PDF control can therefore be reduced to a RBF weight control together with an adaptive tuning of the basis function parameters (i.e., the centers and widths of the basis functions). To achieve this aim, the control horizon is divided into certain intervals hereinafter called batches. Using these definitions, the whole control strategy consists of three stages, namely (a) sub-space parameter identification of the dynamic nonlinear model (that relates the control signal to the weights of the RBF neural network); (b) Weight tracking controller design using an LMI-based convex optimization technique; and (c) RBF basis functions shape tuning in terms of their centers and widths using an iterative learning control (ILC) framework. Among the above stages, the first two are performed within each batch, while stage (c) is carried out between any two adjacent batches. Such an algorithm has the advantage of the batch-by-batch improvement of the closed-loop output PDF tracking performance. Moreover, the controller mentioned in stage (b) is a general controller in a state-space form. Stability analysis has been performed and simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where encouraging results have been made.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2009.2014934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4806171","Convex optimization;generalized state-space controller;iterative learning control (ILC);output probability density function (PDF) control;sub-space system identification","Shape control;Control systems;Stochastic systems;Neural networks;Weight control;Probability density function;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Parameter estimation;Signal processing","adaptive control;approximation theory;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;convex programming;iterative methods;learning systems;linear matrix inequalities;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;nonlinear dynamical systems;parameter estimation;probability;stability;state-space methods;stochastic systems","ILC-based fixed-structure controller design;output PDF shaping;LMI;state-space controller design;probability density function;nonGaussian dynamical stochastic system;radial basis function neural network;approximation theory;adaptive basis function parameter tuning;subspace parameter identification;dynamic nonlinear model;weight tracking controller design;convex optimization;iterative learning control;closed-loop system;stability analysis","","40","","35","","27 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we introduce a general approach for channel selection in mission-critical communications, i.e., choose channels with the best quality timely and accurately via channel probing. Since the channel conditions are dynamic and initially unknown to wireless users, choosing channels with the best conditions is nontrivial. Thus, we adopt online learning methods to let users probe channels and predict the channel conditions by a restricted time interval of observation. We formulate this problem as an emerging branch of the classic multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, namely the pure-exploration bandit problem, to achieve a tradeoff between sampling time/resource budget and the channel selection accuracy (i.e., the probability of selecting optimal channels). The goal of the learning process is to choose the “optimal subset” of channels after a limited time period of channel probing. We propose and evaluate one learning policy for the single-user case and three learning policies for the distributed multiuser cases. We take communication costs and interference costs into account, and analyze the tradeoff between these costs and the accuracy of channel selection. Extensive simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve considerably higher channel selection accuracy than previous exploration bandit approaches and classic MAB methods.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2018.2866198","National Science Foundation of China; US NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440092","Online learning;emergency communications;channel probing;exploration multi-armed bandits","Wireless communication;Mission critical systems;Probes;Interference;Throughput;Switches;Reliability","emergency management;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;radio networks;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","exploration bandit approaches;channel selection accuracy;sampling time-resource budget;online learning methods;optimal channel subset;interference costs;communication costs;learning policy;optimal channels;pure-exploration bandit problem;classic multiarmed bandit problem;channel conditions;channel probing;mission-critical communications;low-latency communication;emergency communications;mission-critical wireless communications","","4","","29","","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A model reference control technique is firstly presented to derive a state error observer for state estimation. A mixed time-domain and s -domain representation is then used to develop an error model as a relative degree one stable system with some uncertain nonlinearities and filtered signals as the inputs. An averaging filter is also proposed to further transform the error model so that the AILC can be implemented without using differentiators. The main learning component of the controller is constructed by an filtered fuzzy neural network with the estimated state variables as network input. This main component performs as an approximator to compensate for the unknown system nonlinearities. Furthermore, a normalization signal is applied as a bounding function for designing a robust learning component in order to overcome the lumped uncertainties from function approximation error and state estimation error. Finally, a stabilization learning component is used to guarantee the boundedness of internal signals. Adaptive algorithms are derived to search for suitable parameters during each iteration since the optimal parameters for a good function approximation are in general unavailable. Based on a Lyapunov like analysis, we show that the output tracking error can converge, with all the internal signals bounded, to a small residual set whose level of magnitude depends on a design parameter. Simulation results also show the nice tracking performance with application to some practical nonlinear systems.","2093-7121","978-89-93215-05-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6703898","","Estimation;Approximation methods;Artificial neural networks;Vectors;Cities and towns;Time-domain analysis;Learning systems","filtering theory;fuzzy neural nets;iterative methods;learning systems;Lyapunov methods;model reference adaptive control systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;observers;stability;uncertain systems","observer-based fuzzy neural network adaptive ILC;uncertain nonlinear systems;adaptive iterative learning control strategy;filtered fuzzy neural network;model reference control;state error observer;time-domain representation;s-domain representation;relative degree one stable system;uncertain nonlinearities;averaging filter;AILC;system nonlinearities;normalization signal;bounding function;robust learning component;lumped uncertainties;function approximation error;state estimation error;stabilization learning component;Lyapunov like analysis;output tracking error","","1","","20","","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, to save energy, data aggregation is used to minimize and/or eliminate data redundancy at each node and reduce the amount of the overall data transmitted in a WSN. Furthermore, energy-efficient routing is widely used to determine the optimal path from the source to the destination, while avoiding the energy-short nodes, to save energy for relaying the sensed data. In most conventional approaches, data aggregation and routing path selection are considered separately. In this study, we consider the degrees of the possible data aggregation of neighbor nodes when a node needs to determine the routing path. We propose a novel Q-learning-based data-aggregation-aware energy-efficient routing algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses reinforcement learning to maximize the rewards, defined in terms of the efficiency of the sensor-type-dependent data aggregation, communication energy and node residual energy, at each sensor node to obtain an optimal path. We used sensor-type-dependent aggregation rewards. Finally, we performed simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed routing method and compared it with that of the conventional energy-aware routing algorithms. Our results indicate that the proposed protocol can successfully reduce the amount of data and extend the lifetime of the WSN.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3051360","Inha University Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321407","Wireless sensor networks;routing;data aggregation;Q-learning;network lifetime","Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Energy efficiency;Data aggregation;Routing protocols;Clustering algorithms;Redundancy","data aggregation;learning (artificial intelligence);routing protocols;telecommunication computing;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","sensor node;optimal path;sensor-type-dependent aggregation rewards;routing method;conventional energy-aware routing algorithms;WSN;data-aggregation-aware energy-efficient routing protocol;wireless sensor network;energy consumption;tiny sensor nodes;data redundancy;energy-short nodes;sensed data;routing path selection;possible data;neighbor nodes;data-aggregation-aware energy-efficient routing algorithm;sensor-type-dependent data aggregation;communication energy;node residual energy","","","","40","CCBY","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"The generation of textual entailment with NLML in an intelligent dialogue system for language learning CSIEC","J. Jia","Department of Educational Technology, Peking University.

The generation of textual entailment (GTE) is critical to the further improvement of CSIEC project and other natural language generation program. Up to now we have found few literatures on the general algorithm for GTE. Simulating the process that a human being learns English as a foreign language, we explore our naive approach to tackle the GTE problem and its algorithm within the framework of CSIEC, i.e. rule annotation in NLML, pattern recognition and entailment transformation. The time and space complexity of our algorithm is tested with some entailment examples. An interactive command line textual entailment editor is created to generalize an entailment rule from a case pair of text and entailment. The test version of this innovative GTE approach can be accessed in the CSIEC website. Further works include the rules annotation based on the English textbooks and a GUI interface for normal users to edit the entailment rules.","","978-1-4244-4515-8","10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906806","Generation of Textual Entailment (GTE);CSIEC;Inference","Intelligent systems;Natural languages;Books;Humans;Computer simulation;Testing;Databases;Robots;Educational technology;Computer science","computer aided instruction;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;interactive systems;natural language processing","textual entailment;intelligent dialogue system;language learning;CSIEC;computer simulation in educational communication;interactive Web-based human-computer dialogue system;English instruction;natural language generation program;rules annotation;GUI interface","","8","","14","","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The output of a fuzzy conjunction unit is computed by taking the minimum of all its inputs. The approach uses hill-climbing search at conjunction units where the backpropagation rule fails to apply because the transfer function is not differentiable. Error propagation at conjunction units requires analysis of error dependency across conjunction. When there are multiple alternatives for error adaptation at a conjunction unit, the choice is the one that allows the system to be modified the best. This approach is evaluated by simulation and compared with the approach which turns a conjunction unit into a pi unit. The results show that the hill-climbing approach is always equal to or better than the other approach in terms of the error at the end of training, but the speed of convergence may be slower in some cases","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1990.137638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5726598","","","fuzzy logic;learning systems;neural nets","backpropagation learning rule;convergence;error adaptation;error dependency;error propagation;fuzzy conjunction units;hill-climbing search;multilayered neural networks;simulation;transfer function","","2","","3","","15 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an example, the binary case with the sigmoidal perceptron as the probability model is presented.

The practical issue of their gradient descent minimization is then studied within the well-formed cost functions framework. It is shown that these are well-formed cost functions for networks without hidden units; hence, their gradient descent minimization is guaranteed to converge to a solution if one exists on such networks.

The extension requires the computation of an approximate inverse of the linearized plant rather than the exact inverse. An advantage of this approach is that the output of the plant need not be differentiated. A bound on the asymptotic trajectory error is exhibited via a concise proof, and is shown to grow continuously with a bound on the disturbances.

Fear learning involves sensory and motor aspects [1] and it is essential for adaptive self-protective systems.

A new Bayes-optimal channel estimator is derived using recent advances in the approximate belief propagation Bayesian inference paradigm. By leveraging the inherent sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angular domain, we recast the underlying channel estimation problem into that of reconstructing a compressible signal from a set of noisy linear measurements. Then, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is used to find the entries of the unknown mmWave MIMO channel matrix. Unlike all the existing works on the same topic, we model the angular-domain channel coefficients by Laplacian distributed random variables. Furthermore, we establish the closed-form expressions for the various statistical quantities that need to be updated iteratively by GAMP. To render the proposed algorithm fully automated, we also develop an expectation-maximization (EM) based procedure that can be easily embedded within GAMP's iteration loop in order to learn all the unknown parameters of the underlying Bayesian inference problem. The computer simulations show that the proposed combined EM-GAMP algorithm under a Laplacian prior exhibits improvements both in terms of channel estimation accuracy, achievable rate, and computational complexity, as compared to the Gaussian mixture prior that has been advocated in the recent literature. In addition, it is found that the Laplacian prior speeds up the convergence time of GAMP over the entire signal-to-noise ratio range.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2892719","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8611231","Massive MIMO;mmWave;channel estimation;minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator;generalized approximate message passing (GAMP)","MIMO communication;Channel estimation;Laplace equations;Message passing;Approximation algorithms;Estimation;Bayes methods","approximation theory;Bayes methods;channel estimation;expectation-maximisation algorithm;inference mechanisms;iterative methods;matrix algebra;message passing;millimetre wave communication;MIMO communication;statistical distributions;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","massive MIMO mmWave channel estimation;massive MIMO communication systems;Bayes-optimal channel estimator;approximate belief propagation Bayesian inference paradigm;noisy linear measurements;generalized approximate message passing algorithm;unknown mmWave MIMO channel matrix;angular-domain channel coefficients;Laplacian distributed random variables;underlying Bayesian inference problem;combined EM-GAMP algorithm;channel estimation accuracy;channel estimation problem;Laplacian prior;millimeter-wave channel estimation;GAMP iteration loop;expectation-maximization based procedure","","10","","43","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid the dependency of the controllers to the analytical knowledge of the multi- joint system, a non parametric learning approach is developed which identifies non linear mappings between sensory signals and motor commands involved in control motor systems. The learning phase is handled through a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) that implements a non parametric Nadarayan-Watson regression scheme and a set of local PIDs. The resulting dynamic sensory-motor controller (DSMC) is intensively tested within the scope of hand-arm reaching and tracking movements in a dynamical simulation environment.

Our two first models are based on low level features, extracted from image regions, which have been stated as useful in the human interest process. A baseline model is built by estimating a linear regression from a small dataset of 49 images. The second model estimates a rewarding term based on additional experimental observations. By adding image semantics, we then construct a last model, which more generally benefits from a better understanding of the content. It also integrates notions such that unusualness or human beings' presence that have proven to play key roles in the interestingness process.

The primary novelty lies in that an effective learning based robust tracking control strategy is developed for nonlinear systems under a general uncertain environment. The augmented system construction is performed by combining the tracking error with the reference trajectory. Then, an improved adaptive critic technique, which does not depend on the initial stabilizing controller, is employed to solve the Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with respect to the nominal augmented system. Using the obtained control law, the closed-loop form of the augmented system is built with stability proof. Moreover, the robust trajectory tracking performance is guaranteed via Lyapunov approach in theory and then through simulation demonstration, where an application to a practical spring-mass-damper system is included.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2017.2722424","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Tianjin Natural Science Foundation; Open Project Program; The State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Early Career Development Award of SKLMCCS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964779","Adaptive critic design;neural networks;optimal control;robust trajectory tracking;self-learning control;system uncertainty","Robustness;Trajectory tracking;Nonlinear systems;Uncertainty;Optimal control;Adaptive systems;Cost function","adaptive control;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;learning systems;Lyapunov methods;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;robust control;springs (mechanical);trajectory control;uncertain systems;vibration control","uncertain dynamics;robust trajectory tracking design;uncertain nonlinear systems;self-learning optimal control formulation;primary novelty;effective learning;robust tracking control strategy;general uncertain environment;augmented system construction;tracking error;reference trajectory;improved adaptive critic technique;initial stabilizing controller;Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman equation;nominal augmented system;control law;robust trajectory tracking performance;practical spring-mass-damper system;HJB;Lyapunov approach","","5","","28","Traditional","30 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model keeps track of the students' knowledge at different levels of granularity, combining the performance and exploration behavior in several experiments, to decide the best way to guide the student in following experiments, and to re-categorize the students based on the results.

In an effort to adapt to the current process environment, the updated model is identified from a moving window of the most recent historical batches. The new model is used to compute control policy for the next batch. The control policy at different batch stages are generally correlated as the overall control policy is obtained to maximize the amount of product at the end of a batch. To address the colinearity issue, partial least square (PLS) is used in estimating the linearised model parameters. The proposed strategy is applied to a simulated fed-batch fermentation process and the performance is evaluated. The effect of window sizes was studied.

First, a robot learns a policy traveling between waypoints in an environment that imitates an actual outdoor environment and avoiding collision with obstacles in our original simulator. DDQN(Double Deep Q-Network) is applied as an learning algorithm. We aim for learning that a robot can take an adequate action from obstacle positions obtained from 2D-LiDAR, a relative distance and a relative angle to a destination. Then, a robot performs navigation in outdoor environments based on the learned policy.

In order to evaluate the process of typing with the tip of the tongue, eight volunteers participated in tip-of-tongue selectivity training experiments using an inductive tongue-computer interface. Performance data based on typing speed and accuracy fits a general learning model based on the power law of practice, which can be used to estimate further improvements of tongue-typing performance.

Parkes","Dept. of Comput., Lancaster Univ., UK","IEE Colloquium on Intelligent Tutoring Systems","6 Aug 2002","1990","","","8/1","8/3","Domains typically have associated with them some notation, or more generally, encodings formed from elements of a medium, which are used to convey information about the concepts, objects and processes of the domain. Often, entities in a domain can be communicated more directly by encodings in an alternative medium, e.g. diagrams. In some systems, the representative encoding which is available to the user (the external encoding) can be manipulated by the user in ways which are constrained to have meaning in encodings in another medium (the internal, or base medium). Such interfaces embody what is called a manipulable inter-medium encoding (MIME). The ITS implications of such systems have been investigated in studies based on a simple 'direct manipulation' graphical interface (called HUGH). The task was the proof of a theorem of context free languages by constrained exploration of derivation tree diagrams. Fifteen postgraduate researchers took part in the experiment. The HUGH system was not an ITS, but an ITS was simulated by the presence of an observer providing coaching as required. At certain points in the interaction, learners were presented with questions (and corresponding answer windows) designed to elicit their semantic accounts of the operations performed. The study indicated some ITS implications of the use of MIMEs.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=181207","","Computer aided instruction;Formal languages;Graphical user interfaces;Human factors;Knowledge based systems","computer aided instruction;context-free languages;graphical user interfaces;human factors;knowledge based systems;teaching","MIME-based learning environment;learner modelling;alternative medium;diagrams;representative encoding;external encoding;base medium;manipulable inter-medium encoding;MIME;ITS implications;direct manipulation;graphical interface;HUGH;context free languages;constrained exploration;derivation tree diagrams;postgraduate researchers;semantic accounts","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To date, there are several case studies of demand management and control projects from around the world. To achieve results with sufficient generality, case studies need to be conducted over long periods, with a reasonable number of diverse households. Such case studies require large capital to set up hardware and software.To bypass these financial and temporal investments, we have designed a simulator for energy suppliers to use in order to learn the likely performance of large-scale deployments. Of main interest is the prediction of not only the level and firmness of demand response in critical peak pricing trials, but also the householdpsilas comfortable level and satisfaction level. As an example of the power of the simulator we have used it to develop and test a new self-adaptive methodology to intelligently control the energy demand. The methodology is adaptive to global factors, such as the market energy price, as well as local conditions, such as the satisfaction level of households. This paper outlines self-adaptive methodologies used within the simulator. Experimental results show energy consumption under different control strategies and the improvement of system behavior through adaptive design. With the self-adaptive demand management strategy, the total energy consumed by one million householdspsila controllable loads has reduced dramatically while the satisfaction level of households is well maintained. This is one of the very first simulators that take into account both technical and human behavior aspects.","1949-3681","978-0-7695-3404-6","10.1109/SASO.2008.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663411","Self-Adaptive Systems;Energy Demand Management;Simulator;Genetic algorithm","Energy management;Predictive models;Project management;Hardware;Investments;Large-scale systems;Load management;Pricing;Automatic testing;Intelligent control","adaptive control;control system synthesis;demand side management;intelligent control;power markets;self-adjusting systems","self-adaptive energy demand management;demand-side program simulation tool;distributed domestic energy management;critical peak pricing trials;market energy price;control strategies;adaptive design","","13","","22","","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An artificial neural network (ANN) control scheme which uses continual online random training (with no offline training) to simultaneously identify and adaptively control the speed of the stepper motor is proposed. The control scheme utilizes two three-layer feedforward ANNs: (1) a tracker identification neural network which captures the nonlinear dynamics of the motor over any arbitrary time interval in its range of operation; and (2) a controller neural network to provide the necessary control actions to achieve trajectory tracking of the motor speed. The inputs to the controller neural network are not constructed from the actual motor/load dynamics, but as a feedback signal, from the estimated state variables of the motor supplied by the neural identifier and the reference trajectory to be tracked by the actual speed. A full nonlinear model (with no simplifying assumptions) is used to model the motor dynamics, and to the best of the authors' knowledge this represents the first such attempt for this device. This paper also makes use of a very realistic and practical scheme to estimate and adaptively learn the noise content in the speed-load torque characteristic of the motor. Simulations reveal that the neural controller adapts and generalizes its learning rate to a wide variety of loads, in addition to providing the necessary abstraction when measurements are contaminated with noise.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.913714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913714","","Artificial neural networks;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Trajectory;Neurofeedback;State feedback;Signal processing;State estimation;Torque;Noise measurement","permanent magnet motors;stepping motors;feedback;neurocontrollers;feedforward neural nets;angular velocity control;adaptive control;AC motor drives;learning (artificial intelligence);machine control","adaptation learning control scheme;high-performance permanent-magnet stepper motor;online random training;neural networks;speed control;high-performance drives environment;artificial neural network control scheme;ANN;continual online random training;adaptive control;three-layer feedforward ANN;tracker identification neural network;nonlinear dynamics;arbitrary time interval;controller neural network;nonlinear model;feedback signal;estimated state variables;speed-load torque characteristic;learning rate;AC motors","","16","","16","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, extreme learning machine (ELM) has attracted much attention and interest among scientific community for its extremely fast learning speed and superior generalization performance. Thus in this paper, the ELM is adopted and compared with Radial Basis Function neural network (RBFNN). The simulation result shows that the accuracy of the integrated navigation system is significantly improved by applying the proposed method and the ELM performs better in real-time capacity and generalization ability.","","978-1-5090-2535-0","10.1109/ICISCE.2016.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7726195","ELM;integrated navigation;data fusion;Kalman filter;GPS outage","Global Positioning System;Training;Kalman filters;Neurons;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms","Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);nonlinear filters;radial basis function networks;telecommunication computing","extreme learning machine integration;GPS outage;SINS/GPS integrated navigation system;GPS signal;hybrid prediction method;extended Kalman filter;EKF;ELM;radial basis function neural network;RBFNN;Global Positioning System","","3","","16","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Limited data available from prior studies evaluating the software indicate a generally positive response from students regarding use of this tool and some improvement in learning. This paper further investigates the effectiveness of MecMovies for improving student understanding when used as a supplement to the more traditional teaching method of lectures and textbook assignments. In this study weekly course assignments in applied mechanics of materials included completion of relevant MecMovie modules to reinforce concepts presented in lecture before students solved traditional textbook problems. The impact of the software on student learning is evaluated by comparing weekly homework and quiz scores, as well as final examination grades, for a class that used MecMovies versus a class that did not. In addition, student feedback regarding the software is presented based on weekly surveys.

The proposed algorithm judiciously combines the classical supervised softmax neural network (SNN) and support vector machine (SVM), and therefore can be efficiently implemented by off-the-shelf tools while achieving promising diagnosis performance. In particular, the proposed algorithm combines the features extracted from SNN and SVM, and is able to robustly diagnose fault conditions with different levels of severity. Besides, the proposed algorithm can also handle complex scenarios where there is more than one fault condition present at the same time. Considering that data with labels of multiple faults are not available in general, we further propose a simple retraining procedure which allows the proposed algorithm to perform multi-fault diagnosis even when the training data are only single labeled.

The four-days exhibition was an occasion to get in touch with the newest experiences with virtual reconstructions, 3D models, interactive environments, augmented reality and mobile solutions for cultural contents; at the same time, it was an opportunity for organizers to directly face the audience's impact towards projects. That because of the necessity to investigate more on social and behavioral aspects in order to positively affect the learning benefits of public. So doing, we could build in the future applications much more tailored on the final costumers, closer to their abilities and necessities. During the show four types of investigative tools were employed to evaluate the general visitor's behavior and the effectiveness of interfaces, to understand their expectations and experiences, and to obtain a reference grid of values to test if users' experience fit with organizers' ones. The first outcomes revealed that audience's impact toward interactive applications seems depending on the capability of technology to be “invisible” otherwise technology has to assure a wide range of possibilities in content accesses.

In this paper, we focus on the channel prediction issue in multiple input-multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. First, we introduce the general channel prediction framework based on the temporal and spatial correlations in MIMO-OFDM systems. Then, we combine the broad learning idea and recurrent computation, and further introduce the broad echo state network (BESN) for channel prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems. Third, to estimate the output weight matrix, we offer two versions of the BESN, i.e., the basic BESN (B-BESN) and the group forward variable selection (GFVS)-based BESN (GFVS-BESN). In the latter, we develop the GFVS strategy to further extract useful information from those collected features in the BESN and make the BESN more able to process the CSI samples. Fourth, inspired by deep learning, we import the conjugate gradient descent backpropagation (CGDBP) technique to fine-tune the random weights and biases in the BESN and give the related derivations. Then, we prove the echo state property in the BESN and analyze the computational complexity. In the simulation section, we comprehensively evaluate the prediction performances for the standard Extended Vehicular A model (EVA) and Extended Typical Urban model (ETU) under different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different antenna configurations, different spatial correlations, different maximum Doppler shifts and different channel prediction methods.

The conjecture considers sensory and perception agents, memory, supervisory elements, activation, reaction, evaluation, and selection agents, alternative generators, modelers, and maintainers within structures which synthesize agents hierarchically. A supervisory hierarchy provides contextual awareness and overall operations management. An experimental model with two scenarios is implemented under the C-SIM hierarchical agent-simulator. The first operates in a text-based mathematical equation space. The second involves agent navigation in a three dimensional space with a series of progressive challenges providing mixed agent roles.

Habitat-Sim is fast - when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU.

These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or `merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works [19, 16] and find evidence for the opposite conclusion - that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} × {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets.

In the recent years, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and supplementary vehicular use cases (e.g., autonomous driving) are considered widely within the scope of cellular networks. These use cases generally demand reliable and low latency services from the cellular network. Mobile Edge Clouds (MEC) in the 5G networks are often applicable to satiate such service demands of a vehicular user. However, the cellular handovers (HO) of vehicular users prompt frequent service migration among the MECs. The handovers and service migration increase the service interruption of a user. In this paper, we consider machine learning (ML) based mobility awareness to obtain future service migration and HO sites of a user. This enables smooth service migration by allowing non-state data transfer earlier to user handover. Further, it provides sufficient time for establishment of successful Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) transmissions, which will reduce service interruption due to HO. Simulation results show that the proposed framework provides timely assistance for service migration and significantly reduces the service interruption time.","","978-1-7281-7356-6","10.1109/ICOIACT50329.2020.9332125","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9332125","5G;mobile edge cloud;CoMP;handover;mobility awareness","Cellular networks;5G mobile communication;Simulation;Machine learning;Handover;Reliability;Intelligent transportation systems","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;cloud computing;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability","cellular network;vehicular user;mobile communication;Intelligent Transportation Systems;Mobile Edge Clouds;MEC;cellular handovers;machine learning based mobility awareness;smooth service migration;service interruption time;coordinated multipoint transmission;CoMP transmission;5G networks","","","","18","","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Sliding-mode learning of a neuro-adaptive robust control configuration","M. de Oliveira Alves; E. G. O. Nobrega","EMBRAER, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronaut. S.A., Brazil; NA","Proceedings of the 2004 American Control Conference","24 Jan 2005","2004","3","","2415","2420 vol.3","Performance and robustness are highly desirable characteristics for any control method. But they are not found in general simultaneously in the same configuration due to its opposite nature. Recently, the compromise between robustness and performance has motivated new studies, mixing adaptive and robust methods, which are complementary in dealing with uncertainties and parameter variation. Variable structure control is a very successful adaptive method which has attracted much attention recently due to its inherent robustness, and also because it is equally applied to linear and nonlinear systems. The basic idea is to restrict the state space of a given plant through a so-called sliding surface, whose dynamics is simpler than the original plant dynamics. Enforcing a state-space trajectory from the initial condition of the plant to reach the surface in finite time, once there the plant remains on the surface and its dynamics is substituted by the surface dynamics. For adequately designed surfaces, they present the invariance property, guaranteeing an intrinsic robustness because the new dynamics does not depend on the plant parameters. Associating sliding-mode algorithms to artificial neural networks, some of the proposed configurations may present simultaneously good performance and robustness. In this work, a new configuration is proposed, implementing a neuro-adaptive control method using the variable structure approach to adjust the neural network weights, and presenting also robustness. The main idea is to add to a regular controller signal, a second control signal generated by an artificial neural network, in order to compensate for perturbations of the plant. An adaptive online learning is adopted whose transient signals are expected do not disturb the main control loop. It is expected also that the controller performance will be maintained through a wide variation of operational conditions of the plant, independently of perturbations caused by structural and parametric variations or nonlinearities not considered in the model. The configuration is explored through two different cases, when there is an acceptable linear model and when such model is not available. Numerical simulations presenting good results justify the expectations for the configuration.","0743-1619","0-7803-8335-4","10.23919/ACC.2004.1383826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383826","","Robust control;Robustness;Artificial neural networks;Sliding mode control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Uncertainty;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems","variable structure systems;neurocontrollers;adaptive control;robust control;linear systems;nonlinear systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","sliding-mode learning;neuro-adaptive robust control configuration;variable structure control;linear system;nonlinear system;state-space trajectory;artificial neural networks;adaptive online learning","","","","13","","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus on two methodologies: a model-based actor-critic (MBAC) strategy, and a nonlinear policy iteration strategy. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, these strategies are applied to the swinging up an inverted pendulum. Numerical simulations show that the neural network approximation in the MBAC strategy can be poor, and the algorithm may converge far from the optimum. In the MBAC approach neither stabilization nor monotonic convergence can be guaranteed, and it is observed that the best value function is not always corresponding to the last one. On the other side the nonlinear policy iteration approach guarantees that every new control policy is stabilizing and generally leads to a monotonically decreasing cost.","1948-3457","978-1-7281-9093-8","10.1109/ICCA51439.2020.9264402","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9264402","","Optimal control;Cost function;Convergence;Approximation algorithms;Nonlinear systems;Linear systems;Task analysis","approximation theory;iterative methods;learning systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;optimisation;pendulums;stability","control policy;nonlinear policy iteration approach;stabilization nor monotonic convergence;MBAC approach;MBAC strategy;neural network approximation;nonlinear policy iteration strategy;model-based actor-critic strategy;input saturation;recent model+learning-based methodologies;inverted pendulum study;model+learning-based optimal control","","","","22","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The realization of such a process presupposes a model in which the student and the teacher share the content and the goals of teaching and at the same time are defined by the context in which the model exists. In the process of teaching, the focus can be shifted to any of the above mentioned elements. From the historical point of view, the advancement and the development of teaching have been conditioned by its relation towards the focus of the model. The increasing involvement of information communication technology in the process has also changed the relationship between the elements in it. The teaching process is organized with precise goals and tailored to meet the students' needs. To a large extent it is also conditioned by the teacher, his characteristics and his style of teaching. The application of ICT in the instruction process, in particular in teaching, has considerably changed the above mentioned circumstances. This paper analyses to what extent the position of the teacher has changed, what are some anticipated advantages and disadvantages of eTeaching in virtual environment and how can these influence the style of teaching.","","978-9-5323-3050-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533584","","Electronic learning;Context modeling;Electronic mail;Communications technology;Virtual environment;Internet;Computer science education;Testing","computer aided instruction;teaching","elearning;ICT;teaching style;synergic process;information communication technology;instruction process;eteaching;virtual environment","","","","11","","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

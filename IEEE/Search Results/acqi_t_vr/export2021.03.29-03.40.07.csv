"Retrieval of land surface parameters using passive microwave measurements at 6-18 GHz","E. G.

The approach is applicable to data that will be acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), planned for launch on the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS)-II and Earth Observing System (EOS) PM-1 platforms in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The retrieval method is based on a radiative transfer (RT) model for land-surface and atmospheric emission, with model coefficients that can be tuned over specific calibration regions and applied globally. The method uses an iterative, least-squares algorithm, based on six channels of radiometric data. Simulations using this algorithm indicate that, for an assumed sensor noise of 0.3 K in all channels, soil moisture and vegetation water content retrieval accuracies of 0.06 g cm/sup -3/ and 0.15 kg m/sup -2/, respectively, should be achievable in regions of vegetation water content less than approximately 1.5 kg m/sup -2/. A surface temperature accuracy of 2 C should be achievable, except for bare soils, where discrimination between moisture and temperature variability is difficult using this algorithm. These accuracies are for retrievals averaged over the sensor footprint, and they exclude conditions of precipitation, open water, snow cover, frozen ground, or high topographic relief within the footprint. The algorithm has been tested using data from the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) for the years 1982-1985, over the African Sahel, and the retrieval results compared to output from an operational numerical weather prediction model.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.739125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=739125","","Land surface;Surface topography;Land surface temperature;Microwave radiometry;Vegetation;Atmospheric modeling;Information retrieval;Content based retrieval;Soil moisture;Satellite broadcasting","geophysical techniques;remote sensing;remote sensing;hydrological techniques;soil;radiometry;radiometry;terrain mapping","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;hydrology;soil moisture;microwave radiometry;SHF;remote sensing;land surface parameters;passive microwave measurement;vegetation mapping;water content;surface temperature;satellite microwave radiometry;retrieval method;radiative transfer model;iterative least-squares algorithm;6 to 18 GHz","","371","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Unmixing the directional reflectances of AVHRR sub-pixel landcovers","G. P. Asner; C. A. Wessman; J. L. Privette","Cooperative Inst. for Res. in Environ.

Since most current BRDF inversion methods utilize one-dimensional (1D) models, surface homogeneity within an image pixel is implied. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is one of the few spaceborne sensors capable of acquiring radiometric data over the range of view angles required for BRDF inversions. However, its relatively coarse spatial resolution often results in measurements of mixed landcovers, and thus the data may not be ideal for BRDF inversions. The authors present a three-step spectral unmixing method for retrieving AVHRR sub-pixel directional reflectances in regions of high spatial heterogeneity. The reflectances of individual vegetation types are deconvolved using co-located Landsat TM and AVHRR data. The three major steps in the model include: (1) unmixing of vegetation endmember concentrations in TM imagery; (2) correction of dissimilar shadow fractions between TM and AVHRR data; and (3) unmixing of AVHRR sub-pixel reflectances of vegetation types for any Sun-sensor geometry. The authors tested the method using simulated TM and AVHRR data. A savannah landscape simulation, comprised of a canopy radiative transfer model and a crown geometric-optical model was used to create images containing mixed pixels of tree, grass, and shade endmembers. TM and AVHRR spectral response functions, viewing geometrics, and off-nadir pixel shape calculations were incorporated into the simulations. Following the successful testing of the unmixing method on error-free simulations, random noise representing atmospheric perturbations and co-registration inaccuracies was added to the data. The method is stable when errors resulting from either the first unmixing step or image co-registration inaccuracies are introduced. Potential errors in the AVHRR data may result in inaccurately retrieved reflectances if the image scene contains a spatially homogeneous mix of landcovers. A method for detecting and mitigating this problem is presented.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.602529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=602529","","Solid modeling;Vegetation mapping;Atmospheric modeling;Pixel;Spatial resolution;Radiometry;Testing;Bidirectional control;Distribution functions;Biomedical optical imaging","geophysical techniques;remote sensing;forestry;geophysical signal processing","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;land cover;vegetation mapping;satellite remote sensing;optical imaging;visible region;IR;infrared imaging;directional reflectance unmixing;AVHRR;sub-pixel landcover;canopy;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;BRDF model;inversion;Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer;three-step spectral unmixing method;subpixel directional reflectance;vegetation endmember concentration;TM imagery;dissimilar shadow fraction;tree;forest;grass;image registration","","36","2","35","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The observed anisotropic reflectance characteristics of these images are consistent with the theoretical analysis presented in Part I of this study. The anisotropic reflectance at the top of atmosphere (TOA) is simulated by radiative transfer modeling and the results show a good model-observation agreement. Based on these modeling results, a method was developed to correct the effect of anisotropic reflectance on AVHRR images in channels 1 and 2. Results show the method is effective and efficient. Comparisons of TOA snow reflectance before and after anisotropic correction show that the systematic and large variation of snow reflectance across the scan lines of an image due to satellite viewing/illumination geometry can either be eliminated or greatly reduced by applying the correction algorithm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841981","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Reflectivity;Snow;Sea ice;Atmospheric modeling;Image resolution;Radiometry;Arctic;Oceans;Bidirectional control","oceanographic techniques;sea ice;snow;remote sensing","snowcover;snowpack;snow cover;ocean;sea surface;sea ice;optical imaging;infrared;visible region;satellite remote sensing;measurement technique;bidirectional anisotropic reflectance;light reflection;AVHRR;channel 1;channel 2;correction;Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer;Arctic Ocean;strong bidirectional reflectance;radiative transfer;model;650 nm;850 nm","","7","","37","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fundamental mission objective is to constrain retrievals of cloud and aerosol properties such that their impact on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes can be determined with an accuracy of 10 W · m-2. However, TOA fluxes cannot be measured instantaneously from a satellite. For the EarthCARE mission, fluxes will be estimated from the observed solar and thermal radiances measured by the Broadband Radiometer (BBR). This paper describes an approach to obtain shortwave (SW) fluxes from BBR radiance measurements. The retrieval algorithms are developed relying on the angular distribution models (ADMs) employed by Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument. The solar radiance-to-flux conversion for the BBR is performed by simulating the Terra CERES ADMs us ing a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The ANN performance is optimized by testing different architectures, namely, feedforward, cascade forward, and a customized forward network. A large data set of CERES measurements used to resemble the forthcoming BBR acquisitions has been collected. The CERES BBR-like database is sorted by their surface type, sky conditions, and scene type and then stratified by four input variables (solar zenith angle and BBR SW radiances) to construct three different training data sets. Then, the neural networks are analyzed, and the adequate ADM classification scheme is selected. The results of the BBR ANN-based ADMs show SW flux retrievals compliant with the CERES flux estimates.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2102768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710411","Angular distribution models (ADMs);anisotropic correction;artificial neural network (ANN);Earth Clouds, Aerosols, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE);remote sensing;solar radiative flux","Artificial neural networks;Neurons;Training;Feedforward neural networks;Clouds;Transfer functions;Input variables","aerosols;atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric optics;atmospheric radiation;backpropagation;clouds;geophysics computing;information retrieval;neural nets;radiative transfer;radiometry;remote sensing","TOA SW radiative flux retrieval;EarthCARE mission;Earth Clouds, Aerosols, and Radiation Explorer;cloud;aerosol;atmospheric radiation process;top-of-atmosphere radiative flux;solar radiance;thermal radiance;Broadband Radiometer;shortwave flux;angular distribution models;Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System;CERES instrument;backpropagation artificial neural network;ADM classification scheme","","13","","25","","7 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the hottest deep learning method, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied in HSRRS image classification and identification due to its powerful information extraction capability. However, adversarial perturbations caused by radiation transfer process or artificial or other unpredictable disturbances often deteriorate the stability of CNN. Under this background, we propose a robust architecture for adversarial attack and detection to classify and identify HSRRS images. First of all, two white-box attacks [i.e., large Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) and fast gradient sign method (FGSM)] are adopted respectively to generate adversarial images to confuse the model, and to assess the robustness of the HSRRS image classifier. Second, adversarial detection models based on support vector machine (SVM) with single or fused two level features are proposed to improve the detection accuracy. The features extracted from the testing CNN full connected layers contain adversarial perturbations and real information, from which SVM classifier and discriminate the real and the adversarial images. The adversarial attack model is evaluated in terms of overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (kc). The simulation results show that the OA decreases from 96.4% to 44.4% and 33.3% for L-BFGS and FGSM attacked classifier model, respectively. The adversarial detection is evaluated via OA, detection probability PD, false alarm probability PFA, and miss probability PM. The simulation results indicate that the fused model with two different level features based on SVM can obtain the best OA (94.5%), PD (0.933), PFA (0.040), and PM (0.067) among the detectors if the classifier is attacked by the FGSM. Meanwhile, when facing the L-BFGS attack, the fused model presents similar performance if the best single level features are utilized.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927376","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor Program; Summit of the Six Top Talents Program of Jiangsu; Program for High-Level Entrepreneurial and Innovative Talents Introduction; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Nanjing Technology Innovation Foundation for Selected Overseas Scientists; 1311 Talent Plan, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756237","Convolutional neural network;attack detection;white-box attack;fast gradient sign method (FGSM);large Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS)","Robustness;Perturbation methods;Deep learning;Training;Remote sensing;Telecommunications;Feature extraction","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;remote sensing;support vector machines","detection probability;deep learning method;information extraction capability;adversarial detection models;HSRRS image classifier;fast gradient sign method;white-box attacks;HSRRS images;radiation transfer process;HSRRS image classification;convolutional neural network;global climate change;geographical situation monitoring;land resource management;land surface information;CNN-based high spatial resolution remote sensing images identification;L-BFGS attack;classifier model;FGSM;adversarial attack model;adversarial images;SVM classifier;adversarial perturbations;detection accuracy;single fused two level features","","2","","39","CCBY","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An irrigation treatment experiment was conducted to investigate response of crop growth to water supply in 2014 and 2015. Plant sampling and canopy spectral reflectance were measured in the two growing seasons. The main goal was to evaluate the potential of selected spectral indices formulated with the Sentinel-2 bands for winter wheat water status assessment. A global sensitivity analysis using reflectance simulated by the PROSPECT-5 and SAILH models showed that leaf water contributed the most to the variation of spectral water indices derived from leaf reflectance but had reduced contribution when the indices were derived from canopy reflectance. Correlation between canopy water content (Cw, C) and canopy spectral water indices was significant, although it was impacted by canopy structural descriptors such as the leaf inclination angle and the leaf area index. Satisfactory estimation of w, C could be achieved using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) (R2 = 0.68, RMSEcv = 0.148 kg·m-2, and n = 463). The estimated Cw, C at the jointing stage was significantly correlated with grain yield.

In the past, the kernel functions were evaluated for the red and near infrared spectral regions both outside and inside molecular absorption bands. In this article they are tailored to the spectral characteristics of MOS/A and MOS/B spectrometers flying onboard IRS-P3. Then, the inversion formulas are applied to real data acquired during a clear-sky day over the Mediterranean Sea to retrieve the variations in the aerosol vertical profile (with respect to the first-guess profile). The agreement between MOS data and the radiance values corresponding to the retrieved profile (through a LOWTRAN simulation) is always better than the agreement between MOS data and the radiances corresponding to a first-guess profile (through a LOWTRAN simulation, too). This gives evidence in favor of the developed retrieval scheme based on kernel functions.","","0-7803-5207-6","10.1109/IGARSS.1999.773585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=773585","","Aerosols;Kernel;Integral equations;Sea measurements;Information retrieval;Satellites;Differential equations;Infrared spectra;Electromagnetic wave absorption;Spectroscopy","aerosols;atmospheric composition;atmospheric techniques;remote sensing","atmosphere;aerosol;measurement technique;vertical profile;troposphere;radiance imagery;MOS;MOS/A;MOS/B;visible spectra;satellite remote sensing;Mediterranean Sea;kernel functions;Fredholm integral equation;optical extinction profile;radiative transfer equations;infrared spectra;inversion formula;retrieval scheme;modular optoelectronic scanner","","","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is applicable for clear atmospheres without any aerosol in a spectral range between approximately 800 and 2500 nm. Standard gas by gas methods yield a 6% rms error in H/sub 2/O retrieval from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data, reaching several tens percent for a set of widespread ground materials and resulting from an simplifying assumption of linear variations of the reflectance model within gas absorption bands and partial accounting of the gas induced signal. JRGE offers a theoretical framework consisting in a two steps algorithm that accounts for sensor characteristics, assumptions on gas concentrations and reflectance variations. It estimates variations in gas concentrations relatively to a standard atmosphere model. An adaptive cubic smoothing spline like estimation of the reflectance is first performed. Concentrations of several gaseous species are then simultaneously retrieved using a nonlinear procedure based on radiative transfer calculations. Applied to AVIRIS spectra simulated from reflectance databases and sensor characteristics, JRGE reduces the errors in H/sub 2/O retrieval to 2.87%. For an AVIRIS image acquired over the Quinault prescribed fire, far field CO/sub 2/ estimate (348 ppm, about 6% to 7% rms) is in agreement with in situ measurement (345-350 ppm) and aerosols yield an underestimation of total atmospheric CO/sub 2/ content equal to 5.35% about 2 km downwind the fire. JRGE smoothes and interpolates the reflectance for gas estimation but also provides nonsmoothed reflectance spectra. JRGE is shown to preserve various mineral absorption features included in the AVIRIS image of Cuprite Mining District test site.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.820604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288379","","Gases;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Reflectivity;Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric measurements;Atmosphere;Aerosols;Information retrieval;Sensor phenomena and characterization","atmospheric composition;atmospheric chemistry;water;carbon compounds;atmospheric techniques;remote sensing;aerosols;smoke;fires;radiative transfer;atmospheric spectra","trace gas measurement;plumes;hyperspectral data;remotely sensed data;joint reflectance and gas estimator;JRGE;atmospheric gas concentrations;surface reflectance;hyperspectral images;aerosol;spectral range;gas by gas methods;Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer;AVIRIS data;linear variations;reflectance model;gas absorption bands;gas induced signal;sensor characteristics;atmosphere model;adaptive cubic smoothing spline like estimation;radiative transfer;AVIRIS spectra;Quinault prescribed fire;Washington;USA;far field CO/sub 2/ estimate;atmospheric CO/sub 2/ content;mineral absorption features;Cuprite Mining District test site;hyperspectral remote sensing;800 to 2500 nm;H/sub 2/O;CO/sub 2/","","20","","38","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For satellite application, we applied our algorithm to selected MODIS-Aqua images acquired over the Red Sea, which captured spatial features of phytoplankton blooms and physical processes (e.g., cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations) in the Red Sea.

NO2 vertical columns are estimated following a well-established two-step approach, i.e., the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique is used to obtain differential slant column densities (dSCD) which are subsequently converted to vertical column densities (VCD) by radiative transfer simulations. First results reveal very plausible distributions of NO2, e.g., peak concentrations in a shopping area or around the airport.

However, the accurate evaluation of LST from space has been severely limited because of the difficulty in separating atmospheric from surface effects as the surface cannot be modeled as a black-body radiator. With this goal in mind, a novel extension of the split-window technique is presented in which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance measured by the satellite is investigated by the ratioing of covariance and variance of the brightness temperatures measured in channels 4 and 5 of AVHRR/2. Furthermore, the contribution of emissivity is evaluated from coefficients that depend on the spectral emissivities in both thermal channels. Using a wide range of simulations from an atmospheric radiative transfer model it is shown that the proposed algorithm provides an estimate of LST, to within 0.4 K if the spectral surface emissivity is known, which is better than that given by the currently used split-window algorithms for LST determination. Also the limitations on algorithm accuracy are discussed considering different values of noise equivalent temperature. Finally the authors present the preliminary results obtained using the proposed method from AVHRR data over a semi-arid region-of Northwestern Victoria in Australia provided by CSIRO, and a mountainous region of Northeast of France acquired in the frame of Regio Klimat Projekt.<>","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.295038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=295038","","Land surface;Land surface temperature;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Atmospheric measurements;Brightness temperature;Atmospheric modeling;Satellite broadcasting;Temperature measurement","atmospheric techniques;geophysical techniques;atmospheric temperature;infrared imaging;remote sensing","atmosphere;meteorology;satellite remote sensing;IR method;measurement technique;split-window;land surface temperature;LST;retrieval;NOAA;AVHRR;far infrared;ratioing of covariance;variance brightness temperature;algorithm;atmospheric radiative transfer model;spectral surface emissivity;3 to 13 mum","","170","","35","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This electrophysiological method is commonly used and neurosurgeons could aware where the nervous system is at risk of being permanently injured while doing the operation under NIOM. However, this monitoring is quite a qualitative evaluation. Neurosurgeons have to use their own experiences to consider and made the estimation. Traditionally, the peripheral nerve function can be preserved by continuous electromyography (EMG) and compound muscle action potential response (CMAP) monitoring. The spike and burst EMG occur when the nerve trunk is irritated or damaged. Decreased amplitude of CMAP response is also considered as nerve damage even it might cause from a severe irritation. By using this information, the peripheral nerve function is qualitatively evaluated by the surgeons. This present study proposed a new predictive nerve model for peripheral nerve function prediction. This input and output data were used for nerve modeling in each condition. The results showed that parameters of the linear nerve model had significantly differences and tendency changes in each nerve condition. Therefore, the proposed method for predicting the nerve function by the shifted linearly nerve model might be a promising approach for peripheral nerve function estimation in the human nerve model.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610664","","Electromyography;Mathematical model;Surgery;Monitoring;Equations;Acoustics;Educational institutions","electromyography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;surgery","surgical manipulation;animal study;model shift;neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring;perioperative neurological deficits;electrophysiological method;neurosurgeons;nervous system;injuries;peripheral nerve function;continuous electromyography;compound muscle action potential response monitoring;spike EMG;burst EMG;linear nerve model","Animals;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Electromyography;Linear Models;Male;Monitoring, Intraoperative;Peripheral Nerves;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Sciatic Nerve;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","4","","11","","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In planning for such a path, considerations have to be taken in terms of the manipulator characteristics and the geometric properties of the bone removal tool used. Presented in this paper is a methodology which takes into account the required efficacy of surgical planning. Differing from other surgical planning methodologies, the final output of the planned surgery can be directly executed by a surgical robot (NeuRobot). In doing so, the surgeon has only to specify the region or features within the skull-base which are to be avoided and the general direction of action which specifies the eventual path that the surgery is to be carried out.

The feedforward neural controller is trained off-line and adaptive weights are adapted on-line to find the reference torques, which controls the steady-state outputs of the mobile robot system. The feedback neural controller is based on the posture neural identifier and quadratic performance index optimisation algorithm to find the optimal torque action in the transient state for N-step-ahead prediction. General back propagation algorithm is used to learn the feedforward neural controller and the posture neural identifier.

Although spectral analysis techniques are widely used in the analysis of noninvasive neural recordings such as EEG, their application to spiking data is limited due to the binary and nonlinear nature of neuronal spiking. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the power spectral density of the neural covariate driving the spiking statistics of a neuronal population from binary observations. Methods: We consider a neuronal ensemble spiking according to Bernoulli statistics, for which the conditional intensity function is given by the logistic map of a harmonic second-order stationary process with sparse narrowband spectra. By employing sparsity-promoting priors, we compute the maximum a posteriori estimate of the power spectral density of the process from the binary spiking observations. Furthermore, we construct confidence intervals for these estimates by an efficient posterior sampling procedure. Results: We provide simulation studies which reveal that our method outperforms the existing methods for extracting the frequency content of spiking data. Application of our method to clinically recorded spiking data from a patient under general anesthesia reveals a striking resemblance between our estimated power spectral density and that of the local field potential signal. This result corroborates existing findings regarding the salient role of the local field potential as a major neural covariate of rhythmic cortical spiking activity under anesthesia. Conclusion: Our technique allows us to analyze the harmonic structure of spiking activity in a robust fashion, independently of the local field potentials, and without any prior assumption of the spectral spread and content of the underlying neural processes. Significance: Other than its usage in the spectral analysis of neuronal spiking data, our technique can be applied to a wide variety of binary data, such as heart beat data, in order to obtain a robust spectral representation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2642783","National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health; Guggenheim Fellowship in Applied Mathematics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795256","Neural signal processing;point process models;power spectral density (PSD);spectral estimation","Estimation;Harmonic analysis;Electroencephalography;Computational modeling;Anesthesia;Neurons;Brain modeling","electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;spectral analysis;statistical analysis","sparse narrowband spectra;neuronal spiking data;spectral properties;neuronal responses;computational neuroscience;functional neuronal processes;spectral analysis;noninvasive neural recordings;EEG;power spectral density;neuronal population;Bernoulli statistics;conditional intensity function;harmonic second-order stationary process;sparsity-promoting priors;efficient posterior sampling processes;frequency content;anesthesia;local field potential signal;rhythmic cortical spiking activity;harmonic structure;local field potentials;heart beat data;spectral representation","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Brain;Electrocorticography;Humans;Machine Learning;Neurons;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","3","","33","Traditional","22 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Understanding the sensemaking process allows building effective visual analytics tools to make sense of large and complex datasets. Currently, it is often a manual and time-consuming undertaking to comprehend this: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. In this paper, we propose a general approach to facilitate such a qualitative analysis process, and introduce a prototype, SensePath, to demonstrate the application of this approach with a focus on browser-based online sensemaking. The approach is based on a study of a number of qualitative research sessions including observations of users performing sensemaking tasks and post hoc analyses to uncover their sensemaking processes. Based on the study results and a follow-up participatory design session with HCI researchers, we decided to focus on the transcription and coding stages of thematic analysis. SensePath automatically captures user's sensemaking actions, i.e., analytic provenance, and provides multi-linked views to support their further analysis. A number of other requirements elicited from the design session are also implemented in SensePath, such as easy integration with existing qualitative analysis workflow and non-intrusive for participants. The tool was used by an experienced HCI researcher to analyze two sensemaking sessions. The researcher found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194834","Sensemaking;analytic provenance;transcription;coding;qualitative research;timeline visualization;Sensemaking;analytic provenance;transcription;coding;qualitative research;timeline visualization","Human computer interaction;Visual analytics;Context;Encoding;Manuals;Web pages","data visualisation;human computer interaction","SensePath;sensemaking process;analytic provenance;visual analytics tool;observation data;screen capture video;think-aloud recording;recurring pattern;general model;qualitative analysis process;browser-based online sensemaking;qualitative research session;participatory design session;HCI researcher;transcription stage;coding stage;thematic analysis;qualitative analysis workflow;sensemaking session","","16","","42","","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The robot has, therefore, to adapt its behavior to the specific working conditions. Classical control methods in robotics require manually programming all actions of a robot. While very effective in fixed conditions, such model-based approaches cannot handle variations, demanding tedious tuning of parameters for every new task. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of autonomously learning new control policies through trial-and-error. However, RL approaches are prone to learning with high samples, particularly for continuous control problems. In this paper, a learning-based method is presented that leverages simulation data to learn an object manipulation task through RL. The control policy is parameterized by a neural network and learned using modern Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. A dense reward function has been designed for the task to enable efficient learning of an agent. The proposed approach is trained entirely in simulation (exploiting the MuJoCo environment) from scratch without any demonstrations of the task. A grasping task involving a Franka Emika Panda manipulator has been considered as the reference task to be learned. The task requires the robot to reach the part, grasp it, and lift it off the contact surface.

Nautical ships present particularly long time delays in response to rudder movements (control actions). Planning for the future encounters with gates should be part of the current control decision, since the ship's position and orientation as it moves through one gate greatly affect the ease of navigation through successive gates.

However, they have a common problem that the technique effective in a certain MMORPG is not equally effective in other MMORPGs, thus no general method to detect bots has been established. Toward establishing such general technique, we analyze behavioral patterns of human players and bots in server-side game log data with two commonly available features characterizing users (human players and bots): location-based information (i.e., speed of players) and action frequency information (i.e., action count per fixed time slot). The main findings of our analysis are as follows: (1) The variation of the speed of bots is smaller than that of humans (i.e, the movement of bots is more efficient). However, the discriminative power of this location-based feature is not so significant in MMORPG, while it showed good performance in First Person Shooting (FPS) game. (2) Action count and battle count indicate more discriminative power than the speed feature. In particular, the action count is more robust than battle count against the size of the time slot.","1550-445X","978-0-7695-4953-8","10.1109/AINA.2013.108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531845","MMORPG;Bot detection;Data mining","Games;Feature extraction;Servers;Electronic mail;Robustness;Three-dimensional displays;Educational institutions","computer games;data analysis;data mining;human-robot interaction;virtual reality","players behavior analysis;Bots behavior analysis;MMORPG;massively multiplayer online role playing game;automatic robot software;virtual world;server-side game log data;location-based information;action frequency information;first person shooting game;FPS;data mining;bot detection","","4","","10","","17 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A general POMDP model is formulated to represent autonomous driving decision-making process, and several approximations are applied to reduce the complexity of solving POMDP model. Firstly, we proposed a maneuver-based decomposition method to represent the possible candidate policies using path and velocity profiles in policy generation process. Secondly, a deterministic machine learning model is built to recognize human-driven vehicles' driving intentions. Then, a situation prediction model is proposed to calculate the possible future actions of other vehicles considering cooperative driving behaviors. Finally, we build a multi-objective reward function to evaluation each policy. In addition, we test our methods in realistic simulation software.

Recent approaches have shown that incorporating sensor's calibration states in addition to the 6DOF pose states may cause better performance of the system. However, these approaches typically consider a passive setting, where robot actions are externally defined. On the other hand, belief space planning (BSP) approaches account for different sources of uncertainty, thus identifying actions that improve certain aspects in inference, such as accuracy. Yet, existing BSP approaches typically do not consider sensor calibration, nor a visual-inertial SLAM setup. In this paper we contribute a BSP approach for active sensor calibration of a visual-inertial SLAM setup. For this purpose we incorporate within the belief both robot's pose and sensor calibration states while considering operation in partially unknown and uncertain environment. In particular, we leverage the recently developed concept of IMU pre-integration and develop appropriate factor graph formulation for future beliefs to facilitate computationally efficient inference within BSP. Our approach is valid for general cost functions, and can be used to identify best robot actions from a given set of candidate actions or to calculate locally-optimal actions using direct trajectory optimization techniques. We demonstrate our approach in high-fidelity synthetic simulation and show that incorporate sensors calibration state into the BSP significantly improved estimation accuracy.","2153-0866","978-1-5386-2682-5","10.1109/IROS.2017.8206085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206085","","Calibration;Planning;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Global Positioning System","calibration;graph theory;mobile robots;path planning;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","estimation accuracy;belief space planning;incremental smoothing;robotics applications;passive setting;robot actions;BSP approaches;visual-inertial SLAM setup;BSP approach;active sensor calibration;calibration states;recently developed concept;sensors calibration state;online visual-inertial navigation;pose state;factor graph formulation","","","","30","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advantages of such an approach include reversibility, suppression of possible self-launched action potentials, and negligible heating or tissue damage. A self-consistent theoretical analysis has been performed. The continuum approach based on the Smoluchowski equation was used to assess membrane electroporation by the high-intensity external pulse. Changes in membrane potential due to conduction current flows arising from localized electroporation were also considered. Our results indicate that a sufficiently high density of pores can be generated by a high-intensity, nanosecond electric pulse. The resulting change in membrane conductance then presents an effective ""electrical short"" to an incident voltage wave traveling across the nerve. The net effect is that the local membrane potential at the affected node is unable to rise significantly. This prevents current injection and activation of sodium channels downstream, thereby, blocking AP propagation. It has also been shown that poration at a single neural segment would be sufficient to produce an observable effect. In reality, more than one segment would be affected. Also, the influence of external electric fields would be better assessed by taking account of non-uniformities and spatial distributions of potential between nerves and the surface electrode regions.","0730-9244","978-1-4244-0915-0","10.1109/PPPS.2007.4345782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4345782","","Biomembranes;Biological system modeling;Probes;Neurophysiology;Neuromuscular stimulation;Medical treatment;Electrical stimulation;Nerve fibers;Heating;Tissue damage","bioelectric potentials;biomembrane transport;neurophysiology","potential conduction block;nerves;biological electrical signaling pathways;action potential;pores;membrane;self-consistent theoretical analysis;Smoluchowski equation;membrane electroporation;membrane conductance;sodium channels;surface electrode","","1","","","","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we study the mechanisms of tactile perception in a task in which a neuro-controlled anthropomorphic robotic arm, equipped with coarse-grained tactile sensors, is required to perceptually categorize spherical and ellipsoid objects. We show that best individuals, synthesized by artificial evolution techniques, develop a close to optimal ability to discriminate the shape of the objects as well as an ability to generalize their skill in new circumstances. The results show that the agents solve the categorization task in an effective and robust way by self-selecting the required information through action and by integrating experienced sensory-motor states over time.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2046174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491156","Artificial neural networks;categorical perception;evolutionary robotics","Shape;Anthropomorphism;Cognitive robotics;Robot sensing systems;Brain modeling;Buildings;Biological neural networks;Artificial intelligence;Testing;Tactile sensors","anthropometry;brain;dexterous manipulators;neurocontrollers;tactile sensors;visual perception","active categorical object shape perception;robot based model;tactile perception;neuro-controlled anthropomorphic robotic arm;tactile sensor;artificial evolution technique;sensory motor state","","18","","35","","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike traditional friend-mate social networks in centralized data centers, this approach uses semantic P2P network technologies. The mobile phones as P2P nodes host the agents for virtual emotional social persons which simulate human's actions and responses by computer algorithms, not only based on intelligence, but also on emotion like human being. The agents for emotional virtual social persons collect their own information such as sex, birthday, astrology, Enneagram, blood type, hobby, health and attributes of his six senses, etc., and arouse emotional actions based on this information. The model keeps the privacy information only in the person's own mobile phone, which can avoid leaking the privacy information. The emotional agents for emotional virtual social persons join the virtual hierarchical tree networks (VIRGO) according to their roles or their interesting domains. And the agents can simulate general emotional reactions by emotional commands via the messages communications. We also discuss the model to mate the most successful friends based on the above information.","","978-1-4244-9003-5","10.1109/GMC.2010.5634597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5634597","emotional virtual social persons;semantic P2P networks;social agent","Organizations;Privacy;Social network services;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Computational modeling;Topology","mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;social networking (online);software agents;virtual reality","mobile friend-mate social networks;semantic P2P network technologies;mobile phones;virtual emotional social persons;emotional agents;virtual hierarchical tree networks","","2","","6","","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, functional connectivity between neurons has been analyzed using simple metrics such as correlation, which do not provide direction of influence. Recently, an information theoretic measure known as directed information has been proposed as a way to capture directionality in the relationship, thereby moving towards a model of effective connectivity. This measure is grounded upon the concept of Granger causality and can be estimated by modeling neural spike trains as point process generalized linear models. However, the added benefit of using directed information to infer connectivity over conventional methods such as correlation is still unclear. Here, we propose a novel estimation procedure for the directed information. Using physiologically realistic simulations, we demonstrate that directed information can outperform correlation in determining connections between neural spike trains while also providing directionality of the relationship, which cannot be assessed using correlation.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091708","","Neurons;Correlation;Topology;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Brain modeling;Measurement","brain;information theory;neural nets;neurophysiology;statistical analysis","directed information;functional connectivity inference;neural ensembles;brain neuronal networks;synaptic connections;information theoretic measure;neural spike train","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Humans;Linear Models;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical;Nerve Net;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","15","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As one of main consequences of DAI are cognitive and attention impairment, the subjects underwent an attention test (Conners CPT) during EEG recording. In order to avoid spurious coherences, related to the volume effect of the head, a Laplacian transformation was applied to the data before connectivity evaluation. The MVAR was fitted to the different phases of the test and different indices were calculated. Even if the general connectivity is not different between patients and controls, differences were found in inter hemispheric connectivity.

Current artificial vision techniques integrate many insights from biology yet they remain far-off the capabilities of animals and humans in terms of speed, power, and performance. A key aspect to modeling the human visual system is the ability to accurately model the behavior and computation within the retina. In particular, we focus on modeling the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as they convey the accumulated data of real world images as action potentials onto the visual cortex via the optic nerve. Computational models that approximate the processing that occurs within RGCs can be derived by quantitatively fitting the sets of physiological data using an input-output analysis where the input is a known stimulus and the output is neuronal recordings. Currently, these input-output responses are modeled using computational combinations of linear and nonlinear models that are generally complex and lack any relevance to the underlying biophysics. In this paper, we illustrate how system identification techniques, which take inspiration from biological systems, can accurately model retinal ganglion cell behavior, and are a viable alternative to traditional linear-nonlinear approaches.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2690139","European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7-ICT-2011.9.11) through the Project VISUALISE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7898416","Artificial stimuli;biological vision;computational modeling;receptive field (RF);retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)","Brain modeling;Retina;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Autoregressive processes;Time series analysis","biology;cellular biophysics;data analysis;eye;neurophysiology;pattern clustering;vision","bioinspired approach;biological vision systems;biology;human visual system;visual cortex;computational models;physiological data;input-output analysis;input-output responses;nonlinear models;biological systems;cell behavior;artificial vision;retinal ganglion cells modeling;data preprocessing;neuronal data;cluster analysis","Action Potentials;Animals;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nonlinear Dynamics;Photic Stimulation;Retina;Retinal Ganglion Cells","1","","47","","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, murine sympathetic spikes are typically detected using a manually adjusted voltage threshold and no unsupervised detection methods have been developed for the mouse. Therefore, we tested the performance of several unsupervised spike detection algorithms on simulated murine renal sympathetic nerve recordings, including an automated amplitude discriminator and wavelet-based detection methods which used both the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and several wavelet threshold rules. The parameters of the wavelet methods were optimized by comparing basal sympathetic activity to postmortem recordings and recordings made during pharmacological suppression and enhancement of sympathetic activity. In general, SWT methods were found to outperform amplitude discriminators and DWT methods with similar wavelet coefficient thresholding algorithms when presented with simulations with varied mean spike rates and signal-to-noise ratios. A SWT method which estimates the noise level using a ""noise-only"" wavelet scale and then selectively thresholds scales containing the physiologically important signal information was found to have the most robust spike detection.

The controller uses a hierarchical hybrid architecture characterized by continuous-time dynamics at the lower level of the hierarchy and logical decision-making units at the higher level of the hierarchy. The lower-level units, i.e., the subcontrollers, are each designed for a power system operating mode and directly interact with the power system to be controlled; while the higher-level decision-making units perform logical checks that identify system mode of operation and activates the corresponding lower-level unit; the activated lower-level unit then executes continuous control actions for the power system. Consequently, the controller can adapt to different power system operating modes.

A serious threat to safety is the fall of a humanoid robot, which can seriously damage both the robot and objects in its surrounding. This paper proposes a strategy for planning and control of fall. The controller's objective is to prevent the robot from hitting surrounding objects during a fall by modifying its default fall direction. We have earlier presented such a direction-changing fall controller in. However, the controller was applicable only when the robot's surrounding contained a single object. In this paper we introduce a generalized approach to humanoid fall-direction control among multiple objects. This new framework algorithmically establishes a desired fall direction through assigned scores, considers a number of control options, and selects and executes the best strategy. The fall planner is also able to select “No Action” as the best strategy, if appropriate. The controller is interactive and is applicable for fall occurring during upright standing or walking. The fall performance is continuously tracked and can be improved in real-time. The planning and control algorithms are demonstrated in simulation on an ASIMO-like humanoid robot.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509159","","Robot control;Humanoid robots;Safety;Orbital robotics;Computational geometry;Robotics and automation;USA Councils;Automatic control;Humans;Strategic planning","humanoid robots;mobile robots;motion control;path planning;safety","humanoid robot;human environment;safety;default fall direction;direction-changing fall controller;multiple objects;fall planner;fall performance;planning algorithm;control algorithm","","11","1","20","","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is illustrated with a simulated fourth order Hodgkin-Huxley spiking neuron model, which is identified using a non-linear second order differential equation model. The simulated result illustrates that the underlying higher order model of the spiking neuron cannot be uniquely determined given only the periodic measured data.

We used simulations of a model enthorinal cortex pyramidal neuron, with known dentritic tree and soma spatial organization, including active compartments defined in terms of standard cable and standard Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Each dendritic compartment (391 total) was endowed with either excitatory (E) or inhibitory (I) synaptic inputs whose strength was randomly specified. We examined the cases of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous spatial distributions for E and I synaptic inputs. The times for synaptic inputs followed a Poisson process with different mean rate regimes varying from 50 to 600 inputs/s. The soma membrane potential received also a background noise in the form of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our main findings are: (1) Power spectra of soma membrane potentials revealed subthreshold resonances at ~40 Hz and ~80 Hz; (2) The contribution of different dendritic compartments, under the examined input ranges and spatial distributions, depended not only of the dendrite-soma path distance, but also on the number of compartments in the dendritic segment. (3) Estimated conditional intensity functions (CIFs) with PPGLMs successfully predicted spiking activity based on given E-I input times; area under ROC curves computed on test data varied from 0.8 - 0.95. (4) The CIF models identified compartments and regions receiving E-I synaptic inputs; Estimated temporal filters were consistent with dendrite-soma path distances and input weights.

One fundamental problem for a DSP is to decide where to place service entities to achieve low-delay pairwise interactions between DIA users, under the constraint that the total placement cost is no more than a specified budget threshold. In this article, we formally model the service entity placement problem and prove that it is NP-complete by a polynomial reduction from the set cover problem. We present GPA, an efficient algorithm for service entity placement, and theoretically analyze its performance. We evaluated GPA with both real-world data trace-driven simulations, and observed that GPA performs close to the optimal algorithm and generally outperforms the baseline algorithm.

However, the parallel programming paradigm involves additional aspects to the merely functional, which could provoke different kinds of bottlenecks in the performance of the applications. Such diff culties may represent critical obstacles, especially for the non-expert users. In this work, we consider the limitations of the automatic development of parallel applications, and the obstacles in the performance tuning process, and we propose a built-in environment that integrates these both processes in a transparent manner. We call our proposal as Environment for automatic development and tuning of Parallel Applications (EPA). EPA follows a cooperative approach: (i) It provides an interface to guide the user in the depiction of the pair problem-solution by completing a form; (ii) such information is automatically formalized in a specif cation; (iii) the specif ed information is automatically used by EPA to instantiate an instrumented skeleton; (iv) the skeleton of the parallel application is a priori enriched in EPA with tuning instrumentation, for monitoring, analysis and tuning actions; (v) the tunable parallel application is automatically generated by EPA; (vi) the user is able to execute the application with no more effort than having completed a form. Clearly, EPA makes transparent the process of code generation and instrumentation, which represents an important advantage especially for non-expert users. Given that the parallelization of any pair problem-solution is hard to generalize, the environment proposes to tackle different parallel problem solvers. The tuning knowledge injected in the generated applications is based on performance models, which makes the decision-making process concise. The Environment could include as problem solvers as needed. In this article, we introduce the problem solver constituted by the Parallel Genetic Algorithms, and - with respect to the tuning process - we consider the improvement of the amount of computational resourses involved in the execution.","","978-1-5090-2088-1","10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568409","parallel paradigm;automatic development;automatic performance tuning;dynamic tuning;genetic algorithms;parallel genetic algorithm","Tuning;Analytical models;Concurrent computing;Knowledge engineering;Instruments;Skeleton;Parallel processing","decision making;genetic algorithms;parallel programming;program compilers","parallel applications tuning;high performance computing;parallel programming paradigm;performance tuning process;EPA;code generation;code instrumentation;parallel problem solvers;decision-making;parallel genetic algorithms","","1","","33","","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to meet the requirement, this paper develops a learning algorithm called Payoff-based Inhomogeneous Partially Irrational Play (PIPIP). The main feature of PIPIP is to allow agents to make irrational decisions with a specified probability, i.e. agents can choose an action with a low utility from the past actions stored in the memory.

In this paper, we use a biophysical-based model and systems theoretic tools to calculate how well a single relay neuron relays a reference input signal as a function of the neuron's electro physiological properties (i.e. model parameters), the modulating signal, and the reference signal parameters. Our analysis is more rigorous than previous related works and is generalizable to all relay cells in the body.

A major issue in the design of behavior-based control systems is the formulation of effective mechanisms for coordination of the behaviors' activities into strategies for rational and coherent behavior. There has been extensive work to construct an optimal controller for a mobile robot by evolutionary approaches such as genetic algorithm, genetic programming, and so on. In this line of research, we have also presented a method of applying CAM-Brain, evolved neural networks based on cellular automata (CA), to control a mobile robot. However, this approach has limitations to make the robot to perform appropriate behavior in complex environments. The multi module coordination method can make complex and general behaviors by combining several modules evolved or programmed, to do a simple behavior. In this paper, we coordinate several modules evolved to do a simple behavior by Maes's action selection mechanism. Maes (1989) has proposed a mechanism for action selection, which is reviewed here and is evaluated using a simulation environment.

Three voltage change approximations were implemented, one used only local information whilst the other two had varying degrees of knowledge about the network. Agents apply the algorithms iteratively so the approximate solutions are refined over time.

Rather than the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The distributed infinite time delays in the discrete-time domain are first defined. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed discrete-time complex network with distributed delays is synchronized if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible discrete and distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, an LMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two simulation examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization and state estimation conditions.

To extract a feature vector from the EMG signal, we use a wavelet packet transform that is a generalized version of wavelet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features, we also propose a linear-nonlinear feature projection composed of principal components analysis (PCA) and a self-organizing feature map (SOFM). The dimensionality reduction by PCA simplifies the structure of the classifier and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping by SOFM transforms the PCA-reduced features into a new feature space with high class separability. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used as the classifier. Using an analysis of class separability by feature projections, we show that the recognition accuracy depends more on the class separability of the projected features than on the MLP's class separation ability. Consequently, the proposed linear-nonlinear projection method improves class separability and recognition accuracy. We implement a real-time control system for a multifunction virtual hand. Our experimental results show that all processes, including virtual hand control, are completed within 125 ms, and the proposed method is applicable to real-time myoelectric hand control without an operational time delay","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.883695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710164","EMG;linear-nonlinear feature projection;pattern recognition;principal components analysis;self-organizing feature map;wavelet packet transform","Real time systems;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Multilayer perceptrons;Control systems;Delay effects","electromyography;medical control systems;medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;prosthetics;self-organising feature maps;signal classification;virtual reality;wavelet transforms","real-time EMG pattern recognition system;electromyogram;linear-nonlinear feature projection;multifunction myoelectric hand;feature extraction;wavelet packet transform;wavelet transform;dimensionality reduction;principal components analysis;PCA;self-organizing feature map;SOFM;classifier;nonlinear mapping;multilayer perceptron;class separability;real-time control system;multifunction virtual hand;125 ms","Action Potentials;Artificial Intelligence;Artificial Limbs;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Muscle, Skeletal;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Prosthesis Design;Robotics;User-Computer Interface","225","","17","","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads. The dyads experiment in a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) scenario to move an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment to reach predefined goal configurations. In this study, we propose a sliding-window approach for feature extraction and demonstrate the online classification methodology to identify interaction patterns.

A scalable network model with six different cell types was built with the pGENESIS neural simulator. The neocortical network consisted of two types of pyramidal cells and four types of inhibitory interneurons. All cell types contained both fast sodium and delayed rectifier potassium channels for generation of action potentials. A subset of the pyramidal neurons contained an additional slow inactivating (persistent) sodium current (NaP). The neurons with the NaP current showed spontaneous bursting activity in the absence of external stimulation. The model also included a routine to calculate a simulated electroencephalogram (EEG) trace from the population activity. This revealed emergent network behavior which ranged from desynchronized activity to different types of seizure-like bursting patterns. At settings with weaker excitatory network effects, the propensity to generate seizure-like behavior increased. Strong excitatory network connectivity destroyed oscillatory behavior, whereas weak connectivity enhanced the relative importance of the spontaneously bursting cells. Our findings are in contradiction with the general opinion that strong excitatory synaptic and/or insufficient inhibition effects are associated with seizure initiation, but are in agreement with previously reported behavior in neocortex.","","0-7803-8439-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1404118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404118","Epilepsy;neocortex;neural modeling","Cellular networks;Voltage;Intelligent networks;Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Neurons;Biomembranes;Electrodes;Pathology","bioelectric potentials;physiological models;neurophysiology;biomembrane transport;sodium;potassium;electroencephalography;diseases;medical computing","cellular voltage-sensitive conductance;network parameters;neocortex;epileptiform bursting;intrinsic neuronal membrane properties;oscillatory activity;scalable network model;pGENESIS neural simulator;pyramidal cells;inhibitory interneurons;fast sodium channels;delayed rectifier potassium channels;action potentials;pyramidal neurons;slow inactivating sodium current;electroencephalogram;desynchronized activity;seizure-like bursting patterns;excitatory network effects;strong excitatory synaptic effects","","1","","19","","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the tactical decision-making for learning-based driving solution, we introduce hierarchical behavior and motion planning (HBMP) to explicitly model the behavior in learning-based solution. Due to the coupled action space of behavior and motion, it is challenging to solve HBMP problem using reinforcement learning (RL) for long-horizon driving tasks. We transform HBMP problem by integrating a classical sampling-based motion planner, of which the optimal cost is regarded as the rewards for high-level behavior learning. As a result, this formulation reduces action space and diversifies the rewards without losing the optimality of HBMP. In addition, we propose a sharable representation for input sensory data across simulation platforms and real-world environment, so that models trained in a fast event-based simulator, SUMO, can be used to initialize and accelerate the RL training in a dynamics based simulator, CARLA. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Most of the contemporary AI is still expressed as hard-coded scripts. The complexity and manageability of the script codebase is one of the key limiting factors for further AI improvements. In this paper, we address this issue. We present behavior objects (BO)-a general approach to development of NPC behaviors for large OWGs.

Our approach promotes encapsulation of data and code for multiple related behaviors in one place, hiding internal details and embedding intelligence in the environment.

This ability is necessary to allow planning of object manipulations. Physics simulators can be used to do this, but they model many kinds of object interaction poorly. An alternative is to learn a motion model for objects by interacting with them. In this paper we address the problem of learning to predict the interactions of rigid bodies in a probabilistic framework, and demonstrate the results in the domain of robotic push manipulation. A robot arm applies random pushes to various objects and observes the resulting motion with a vision system. The relationship between push actions and object motions is learned, and enables the robot to predict the motions that will result from new pushes. The learning does not make explicit use of physics knowledge, or any pre-coded physical constraints, nor is it even restricted to domains which obey any particular rules of physics. We use regression to learn efficiently how to predict the gross motion of a particular object. We further show how different density functions can encode different kinds of information about the behaviour of interacting objects. By combining these as a product of densities, we show how learned predictors can cope with a degree of generalisation to previously unencountered object shapes, subjected to previously unencountered push directions. Performance is evaluated through a combination of virtual experiments in a physics simulator, and real experiments with a 5-axis arm equipped with a simple, rigid finger.","1050-4729","978-1-61284-385-8","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980295","","Shape;Robots;Physics;Predictive models;Equations;Three dimensional displays;Training","dexterous manipulators;manipulator kinematics;motion estimation;path planning;regression analysis;robot vision;shear modulus","rigid body interaction;probabilistic framework;robotic push manipulation;robot arm;vision system;push actions;object motion;regression analysis;gross motion prediction;density functions;performance evaluation;physics simulator;5-axis arm;rigid finger","","40","","15","","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Lyapunov closed-loop analysis yields explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES). The complete kinematic and dynamic closed-loop system of the 3-D ILOS guidance law is analyzed in the following and hence extending the analysis to underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the 3-D straight-line path-following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents.

It is known that the optimal consensus control for multi-agent systems relies on the solution of the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is generally impossible to be solved analytically. Even worse, most real-world systems are too complicated to obtain accurate mathematical models. To overcome these deficiencies, a data-based adaptive dynamic programming method is presented using the current and past system data rather than the accurate system models also instead of the traditional identification scheme which would cause the approximation residual errors. First, we establish a discounted performance index and formulate the optimal consensus problem via Bellman optimality principle. Then, we introduce the policy iteration algorithm which motivates this paper. To implement the proposed online action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming method, two neural networks (NNs), 1) critic NN and 2) actor NN, are employed to approximate the iterative performance index functions and control policies, respectively, in real time.

It is assumed that, at each iteration, the value and action update equations can be exactly solved. The following two standard neural networks (NN) are used: a critic NN is used to approximate the value function, whereas an action network is used to approximate the optimal control policy. It is stressed that this approach allows the implementation of HDP without knowing the internal dynamics of the system. The exact solution assumption holds for some classes of nonlinear systems and, specifically, in the specific case of the DT linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the action is linear and the value quadratic in the states and NNs have zero approximation error. It is stressed that, for the LQR, HDP may be implemented without knowing the system A matrix by using two NNs.

In a joint research project, we aimed at creating a CJM approach that allows for the participation of a broad audience in the creation process that especially has no experience in CJM or modeling.

A class of adaptive critic designs that can be classified as (model-free) action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming is used in the present project. Adaptive critic designs are defined as designs that approximate dynamic programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control over time in noisy, nonlinear environment. The present work uses a system, called ""critic"", to approximate the cost function in dynamic programming and thus to achieve optimal control. The goals of the present learning control design for automotive engines are emissions reduction and maintenance of optimal performance under various operating conditions. Using the data obtained from a test vehicle, we first develop a neural network model of the engine. A neural network controller is then designed based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control. In the simulation studies, the initial controller is trained using the neural network engine model developed rather than the actual engine. We have developed and tested self-learning neural network controllers for both engine torque and exhaust airfuel ratio control. For both control problems, good transient performance of the neural network controller has been observed. A distinct feature of the present technique is the controller's real-time adaptation capability based on real vehicle data which allows the neural network controller to be further refined and improved in real-time vehicle operation through continuous learning.","0743-1619","0-7803-8335-4","10.23919/ACC.2004.1383945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383945","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Automotive engineering;Engines;Neural networks;Dynamic programming;Optimal control;Torque control;Vehicles;Working environment noise","neurocontrollers;control system synthesis;optimal control;adaptive control;learning systems;pollution control;dynamic programming;internal combustion engines;torque control","automotive engine control;adaptive critic learning techniques;air-fuel ratio control;heuristic dynamic programming;optimal control;learning control design;emissions reduction;neural network;engine torque","","5","1","36","","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is thus important to determine a meshing strategy well adopted to achieve both acceptable accuracy for potential distributions and reasonable computation times and memory usage. In this paper, we propose to achieve this goal by smoothing regular hexahedral finite elements at material interfaces using a node-shift approach. We first present the underlying theory for two different techniques for modeling a current dipole in FE volume conductors, a subtraction and a direct potential method. We then evaluate regular and smoothed elements in a four-layer sphere model for both potential approaches and compare their accuracy. We finally compute and visualize potential distributions for a tangentially and a radially oriented source in the somatosensory cortex in regular and geometry-adapted three-compartment hexahedra FE volume conductor models of the human head using both the subtraction and the direct potential method. On the average, node-shifting reduces both topography and magnitude errors by more than a factor of 2 for tangential and 1.5 for radial sources for both potential approaches. Nevertheless, node-shifting has to be carried out with caution for sources located within or close to irregular hexahedra, because especially for the subtraction method extreme deformations might lead to larger overall errors. With regard to realistic volume conductor modeling, node-shifted hexahedra should thus be used for the skin and skull compartments while we would not recommend deforming elements at the grey and white matter surfaces.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.890736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273626","Dipole;direct potential approach;EEG;finite-element method;geometry-adapted hexahedra;realistic head modeling;regular hexahedra;source reconstruction;subtraction potential approach","Finite element methods;Electroencephalography;Distributed computing;Conducting materials;Brain modeling;Conductors;Mesh generation;Smoothing methods;Visualization;Solid modeling","bioelectric potentials;brain models;electroencephalography;mesh generation;neurophysiology","geometry-adapted meshes;hexahedral meshes;finite element method;EEG source analysis;electroencephalography;mesh generation;material interfaces;node-shift approach;direct potential method;radially oriented source;somatosensory cortex;geometry-adapted volume conductor models;three-compartment hexahedra volume conductor model;FE volume conductor models;human head;subtraction method.;node-shifting;tangential sources;deformations;node-shifted hexahedra;skin;skull compartments;grey matter surface;white matter surface","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Models, Neurological;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","53","","27","","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our two-stage technique learns first a generic effective control strategy based on average patient data (factory stage) and can then fine-tune itself to individual patients (personalization stage). The results showed that the reinforcement learner as compared to a bang-bang controller reduced the dose of the anesthetic agent administered by 9.4% and kept the patient closer to the target state, as measured by RMSE (4.90 compared to 8.47). It also kept the BIS error within a narrow, clinically acceptable range 93.9% of the time. Moreover, the policy was trained using only 50 simulated operations.

Interaction between robotic devices allow improved swarm level properties with features more than the sum of the contributions of the individual robotic devices that form the swarm. However, it is challenging to pinpoint particular primitive actions which drive robotic devices towards deliberately engineered emergent behaviour. We propose an XSet model inspired by the behaviours of message passing agents. An XSet model supports direct device to device interactions in which implicit communication spaces arise. In this context, an XSet puts together primitive actions, parameters, and meta information which stipulates when primitive actions are useful. We assess path finding abilities of message passing robotic devices and compared them to the relative performances of random wandering and stigmergic counterparts. Better message passing performances are observed when time in simulation is sufficiently long, and when the population of robotic devices in the swarm is high. Beside presenting a new swarm control model, the proposed XSet brings us closer to the identification of generalized swarm control rules.","","978-1-7281-0040-1","10.1109/IMITEC45504.2019.9015862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9015862","XSet;routine;message passing;robotic device;emergent behaviour","Robot kinematics;Message passing;Task analysis;Mathematical model;Robot sensing systems;Performance evaluation","control engineering computing;message passing;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;path planning;swarm intelligence","XSet model;path finding robotic devices;swarm intelligence systems;swarm level emergent behaviour;swarm level properties;primitive actions;device to device interactions;message passing agents","","1","","32","","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Large models not only affect model generalization but also put a computational burden on computing an optimal solution especially when the goal is to implement the BMI in low-power, portable hardware. In this paper, three methods are presented to quantitatively rate the importance of neurons in neural to motor mapping, using single neuron correlation analysis, sensitivity analysis through a vector linear model, and a model-independent cellular directional tuning analysis for comparisons purpose. Although, the rankings are not identical, up to sixty percent of the top 10 ranking cells were in common. This set can then be used to determine a reduced-order model whose performance is similar to that of the ensemble. It is further shown that by pruning the initial ensemble neural input with the ranked importance of cells, a reduced sets of cells (between 40 and 80, depending upon the methods) can be found that exceed the BMI performance levels of the full ensemble.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300786","","Neurons;Portable computers;Algorithm design and analysis;Kinematics;Buildings;Explosions;Hardware;Sensitivity analysis;Vectors;Reduced order systems","neurophysiology;bioelectric potentials;medical computing;biomechanics;correlation methods;sensitivity analysis;cellular biophysics;handicapped aids","neurons;brain-machine interfaces algorithms;chronically recorded neuron activity;kinematic variables reconstruction;neural-motor mapping;single neuron correlation analysis;sensitivity analysis;vector linear model;model-independent cellular directional tuning analysis;reduced-order model","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Animals;Cerebral Cortex;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Female;Hand;Likelihood Functions;Macaca;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Movement;Nerve Net;Neurons;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","76","2","29","","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work employs a SAN as a technique to provide the interface's action selection mechanism in an uncertain environment. The paper combines the SAN with the temporal logic to provide an e-learning system that a learning activity level evolves according to their expected contextual relevance. The system differs from the other e-learning by representing dynamic associations between learning activities and the relevance subjects. This system equipped with an event-triggered learning interface (context) adaptation component. This component provides multiple parallel processes for perception. These processes provide context screen selection and learning task operation based upon the user current situation. The SAN attempts to achieve a number of goals in an unpredictable complex dynamic environment. Spreading activation explains the predictive top-down effect of knowledge. It supports general heuristics which may be used as the first step of more elaborated methods. This model is suited to deal with the interaction between semantic and episodic memories, as well as many other practical issues regarding e-learning, including the retroactive effect of semantics over perception. The system uses the SAN to activate the most suitable interface screen (context) in response to the current conditions (learning activities) while the system continues working towards the learning objective goal. The paper presents our efforts to realize such e-learning system. The proposed paradigm has been implemented to develop a prototypical system, and the experiments also illustrate the robustness of such an e-learning framework","0840-7789","1-4244-0038-4","10.1109/CCECE.2006.277285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4055069","E-Learning;Human-Machine Interaction","Electronic learning;Storage area networks;Multimedia systems;Psychology;Humans;Learning systems;Computer architecture;IP networks;Discussion forums;Electronic mail","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;human factors;psychology;temporal logic","dynamic associative e-learning model;spreading activation network;dynamic semantic model;psycholinguistic theory;human memory;action selection mechanism;temporal logic;event-triggered learning interface adaptation component;parallel process;context screen selection","","1","","7","","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To investigate how long-term memory is encoded, we are constructing a large-scale biologically realistic model of the rat hippocampus. This work focuses on how topography contributes to the output of the hippocampus. Generally, the brain is structured with topography such that the synaptic connections formed by an input neuron population are organized spatially across the receiving population. The first step in our model was to construct how entorhinal cortex inputs connect to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We have derived realistic constraints from topographical data to connect the two cell populations. The details on how these constraints were applied are presented. We demonstrate that the spatial connectivity has a major impact on the output of the simulation, and the results emphasize the importance of carefully defining spatial connectivity in neural network models of the brain in order to generate relevant spatiotemporal patterns.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346190","","Hippocampus;Nerve fibers;Biological system modeling;Surfaces;Sociology;Statistics","bioelectric phenomena;brain;cellular biophysics;large-scale systems;neurophysiology;physiological models","topographically constrained connectivity implementation;large-scale biologically realistic model;rat hippocampus;brain;long-term memories;encoding process;neuron morphology;synaptic plasticity;synaptic connections;input neuron population;entorhinal cortex inputs;dentate gyrus;topographical data;cell populations;spatial connectivity;neural network models;spatiotemporal patterns","Action Potentials;Animals;Computer Simulation;Entorhinal Cortex;Hippocampus;Models, Neurological;Neurons;Rats;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Synapses","8","","9","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the fractional-order closed-loop system has proven to be stable. By comparing simulations and experiments, the satisfactory performance, such as overshoot, settling time and steady-state error, has been achieved. The cloud-model-based quantum genetic algorithm (CQGA) is employed to tune coefficients of fractional-order PID controller. The quantum bits and quantum superposition states avoid the pressure of selection and maintain the diversity of population in chromosome coding. Due to the randomness and stability tendency of cloud droplets, the cloud crossover operator and the cloud mutation operator can effectively overcome the shortcomings of premature and slow searching speed.

We proved that the model with a distributed plasticity produces a faster and more accurate cerebellar response, especially during a second session of acquisition, compared with the single plasticity model. Furthermore, the pathological model shows an impaired learning capability in Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex acquisition, as found in neurophysiological studies.

These tests calculate confidence intervals using simulated point processes on the discharge of a motor unit, but require a significant amount of calculation time for the point process simulation. In order to overcome such a disadvantage in practical use, we provide a statistical formulization of the two above-mentioned tests using a combination theory. In general, the time required for calculating confidence intervals using these formula-based approaches was 2-13 times faster than when using the previous approaches. Unlike the previous ones, these formula-based approaches do not need to judge that a simulation process converges to the substationary state, and calculate an ideal distribution of statistical noise on the histogram, thereby providing high accuracy. We conclude that the formula-based approaches increase reliability and are sufficiently sophisticated for practical use.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.818470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237369","","Testing;Histograms;Humans;Biomembranes;Frequency;Protocols;Delay effects;Statistical distributions;Neurons;Probability","statistical analysis;neurophysiology;bioelectric potentials;muscle","peristimulus time histograms;combination theory;reliability increase;confidence intervals calculation;human neural projections evaluation;motor-unit discharge;constant delay time;formula-based approach;statistical tests","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Electric Stimulation;Electromyography;Evoked Potentials, Motor;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Motor Neurons;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2","","8","","20 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After the severe absence of investments in the transmission grid observed in the last decades, the transmission investment problem is currently a topic of increasing interest among the power market agents as well as regulatory authorities. Therefore, tailored investment valuation models are needed for quantifying the contribution of strategic flexibility in the investment portfolios. In addition, models capable of replicating the uncertain evolution of the long-term behavior of power markets represent a reliable benchmark for designing contingent actions against unfavorable unfolding of uncertainty, aiming at ensuring the transmission network adaptation. This paper analyzes the impact of flexibility on the evaluation of transmission investment under uncertainty based on system-wide social welfare. Stochastic simulations are performed in order to characterize the uncertainty behavior of the investment portfolio performance. From these simulations, an appraisal methodology based on a Real Options approach is applied for valuing the strategic flexibility embedded into the transmission projects and finding the optimal timing for investing. The results show how omission or incorrect handling, of ongoing project uncertainty of the key variables could lead to non-optimal decisions.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2729-9","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345169","Monte Carlo simulation;Real Options;strategic flexibility;transmission investment;uncertainty","Investments;Uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Portfolios;Monte Carlo methods;Optimization;Decision making","decision making;investment;power grids;power markets;power transmission economics;power transmission reliability;public administration;stochastic processes","decision-making;electricity consumption;economic efficiency;electric power transmission network;transmission grid;transmission investment problem;power market agents;regulatory authorities;tailored investment valuation models;investment portfolios;contingent action design;transmission network adaptation;system-wide social welfare;stochastic simulations;investment portfolio performance;real option approach;transmission projects;nonoptimal decisions","","3","","18","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, such systems are key to effective environmental designs that facilitate aging in place. Typically, gesture recognition takes the form of template matching in which the human participant is expected to emulate a choreographed motion as prescribed by the researchers. A corresponding robotic action is then a one-to-one mapping of the template classification to a library of distinct responses. In this paper, we explore a recognition scheme based on the growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm that places no initial constraints on the user to perform gestures in a specific way. Motion descriptors extracted from sequential skeletal depth data are clustered by GNG and mapped directly to a robotic response that is refined through reinforcement learning. A simple good/bad reward signal is provided by the user. This paper presents results that show that the topology-preserving quality of GNG allows generalization between gestured commands. Experimental results using an automated reward are presented that compare learning results involving single nodes versus results involving the influence of node neighborhoods. Although separability of input data influences the speed of learning convergence for a given neighborhood radius, it is shown that learning progresses toward emulation of an associative memory that maps input gesture to desired action.","2168-2305","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2291714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687233","Gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;machine learning;robots","Robot sensing systems;Gesture recognition;Neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Topology","gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;image classification;neurocontrollers;path planning;robot vision;robots","gesture learning interface;simulated robot path shaping;human teacher;human gesture recognition;intuitive human-machine interfaces;ubiquitous computing;assistive robotics;template matching;one-to-one mapping;choreographed motion emulation;template classification;GNG algorithm;growing neural gas;motion descriptors;sequential skeletal depth data;reinforcement learning;good-bad reward signal;topology-preserving quality;generalization;node neighborhoods;input data separability;associative memory","","23","","75","","18 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these analyses require developing novel methods to assess causality between binary-valued spikes and continuous-valued fields, which have fundamentally different statistical profiles and time-scales. Thus classical measures of causality cannot be directly applied in multiscale networks. We develop a novel parametric method to assess causality for multiscale spike-field activities by computing directed information. Directed information is an information theoretic measure of causality but is in general hard to estimate. Our method estimates the causality in two steps. First, we construct point process generalized linear models (GLM) for each neuron's spiking activity to estimate its firing rate using the history of both spikes and fields and compute the directed information to spike nodes from any node. Second, we construct regression models for fields using the history of the estimated firing rates and the history of fields, and then compute the directed information to each field node from any node. In both steps, we estimate model parameters using maximum likelihood and devise statistical tests to assess the significance of the causality. Using simulated data from basic three-node structures and a ten-node network, we show that our method can asymptotically identify the true causality. This method could help uncover functional connectivity in the brain at multiple spatiotemporal scales.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512823","","History;Computational modeling;Neurons;Network topology;Topology;Biological system modeling;Brain modeling","bioelectric phenomena;brain;neural nets;neurophysiology;regression analysis","spatiotemporal scales;continuous-valued fields;binary-valued spikes;spike-field activity;multiscale causality","Action Potentials;Brain;Linear Models;Models, Neurological;Neurons","","","12","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The distributed delay is assumed to be general in the sense that it is a linear combination of gamma distributed weak and strong memory kernels. It is found that the expected membrane potential in the subthreshold regime exhibits damped oscillatory behavior. This causes the ISI pattern to become bimodal/multimodal. Furthermore, the effect of external damped oscillatory current in the GNMDD model is investigated. Based on extensive simulation study of a set of coupled stochastic differential equations in the presence of a threshold, a vast amount of spiking data are generated. Using the non-parametric modeling approach, the optimal bin width of the histogram is obtained by using the Freedman-Diaconis rule. It is to be noted that, with the increasing amplitude of the damped oscillatory current, the multimodal ISI distribution changes to unimodal ISI distribution when the magnitude of external current reaches a critical value. It is found that the entropy also shows a sudden transition around the critical point. This phenomenon is akin to a phase transition.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2018.2845454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8376013","Stochastic integro-differential equation;inter-spike interval;damped oscillatory input;multimodal/bimodal/unimodal distribution;Freedman-Diaconis rule;entropy computation;critical point","Mathematical model;Delays;Kernel;Analytical models;Stochastic processes;Nanobioscience","bioelectric phenomena;bioelectric potentials;damping;entropy;gamma distribution;neurophysiology;stochastic processes","external damped oscillatory;generalized neuronal model;distributed delay;strong memory kernels;subthreshold regime exhibits;oscillatory behavior;ISI pattern;GNMDD model;coupled stochastic differential equations;nonparametric modeling approach;multimodal ISI distribution changes;unimodal ISI distribution;bimodal inter-spike interval distribution;multimodal inter-spike interval distribution","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Animals;Computational Biology;Humans;Models, Neurological;Stochastic Processes","","","42","","8 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we show by simulations and animal experiments that multipoint simultaneous stimulation with a surface electrode array can selectively activate nerves in a bundle at a desired location in between the array or at a desired depth, which are referred to as lateral or depth-wise gating stimulation, respectively. The stimulation broadly generates action potentials with cathodic source electrodes, and simultaneously blocks unnecessary propagation with downstream anodic gate electrodes. In general, stimulation with a small diameter electrode can affect a nearly hemispherical region, while a large electrode is effective at a more vertically compressed region, i.e., a surface of nerve bundle. The gating stimulation takes advantage of the size effects by utilizing an asymmetrical electrode array. The array of the lateral gating stimulation is designed to have four electrodes; a pair of large source electrodes and a pair of small gate electrodes. The depth-wise gating stimulation array consists of two electrodes; a large gate and small source electrodes. The simulation first demonstrated that appropriate combination of currents at the source and gate electrodes can change recruitment patterns of nerves with lateral or depth-wise selectivity as desired.

This paper focuses on mechanisms for energy efficiency in uplink of multi-carrier wireless systems and rate control in wireless networks. The problem is modeled as strategic (nonco-operative) game with a resource pricing scheme, where the prices are imposed by a mechanism designer. The users decide on their actions according to both own preferences and given prices. The rules and incentives of the mechanism are designed in such a way that the system objective which is a combination of social welfare and energy efficiency is maximized. A weighting parameter in the objective function allows to smoothly vary the emphasis from social welfare to energy efficiency according to the preference of the designer. The users are assumed initially to be concerned only about their throughput. However, the designer modifies their incentives using pricing so that they become more energy-aware. A distributed optimization framework is developed accordingly in which users have general concave utilities (in terms of throughput) that are unknown to the designer and the energy-efficiency objective is expressed as a convex function of user power levels. An iterative pricing mechanism is obtained as a result, and illustrated through simulations.","","978-1-61284-824-2","10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5930050","","Pricing;Games;Interference;Wireless networks;Convex functions;Optimization","convex programming;decision making;game theory;iterative methods;pricing;radio networks;resource allocation","energy efficiency;wireless networks;network mechanism design;social welfare maximization;resource allocation mechanisms;independent decision-makers;multicarrier wireless systems;rate control;strategic game;noncooperative game;resource pricing scheme;incentives;general concave utilities;convex function;iterative pricing mechanism","","1","","14","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, SN P systems with white hole neurons are proposed, in which each neuron has only white hole rules. The computational power of general and bounded SN P systems with white hole neurons are obtained. Specifically, it is achieved in a constructive way that i) general SN P systems (having both bounded and unbounded) white hole neurons are Turing universal as number generators; ii) bounded SN P systems with white hole neurons can only characterize semi-linear sets of numbers.

"Self-Organization and Compositionality in Cognitive Brains: A Neurorobotics Study","J. Tani","Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea","Proceedings of the IEEE","25 Mar 2014","2014","102","4","586","605","The most pressing question about cognitive brains is how they support the compositionality that enables combinatorial manipulations of images, thoughts, and actions. When addressing this problem with synthetic modeling, the conventional idea prevalent in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, generally, is to assume hybrid systems and corresponding neural network models, where higher order cognition is realized by means of symbolic representation and lower sensory-motor processes by analog processing. However, the crucial problem with such approaches is that the symbols represented at higher order cognitive levels cannot be grounded naturally in sensory-motor reality. The former are defined in a discrete space without any metric, and the latter are defined in a continuous space with a physical metric. These, therefore, cannot directly interact with each other, regardless of the interface that is assigned between them. The proposal in the current paper is to reconstruct higher order cognition by means of continuous neurodynamic systems that can elaborate delicate interactions with the sensory-motor level while sharing the same metric space. Our neurorobotics experiments-including language-action associations and the learning of goal-directed actions-show that the compositionality necessary for higher order cognitive tasks can be acquired by means of self-organizing dynamic structures, via interactive learning between the top-down intentional process of acting on the physical world and the bottom-up recognition of perceptual reality. Using robotic simulations, the current paper demonstrates that nonlinear dynamic phenomena, such as bifurcations and the chaotic dynamics induced by unstable fixed points, could play essential roles in realizing higher order functions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2308604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775263","Chaos;cognition;compositionality;dynamical systems;neural network models;neurorobotics;self-organization;sensory-motor systems","Robot sensing systems;Predictive models;Brain models;Cognitive science;Recurrent neural networks;Self-organizing networks","brain;cognition;intelligent control;intelligent robots;medical robotics;mobile robots;neurophysiology","self-organization;cognitive brains;neurorobotics;artificial intelligence;hybrid systems;neural network models;symbolic representation;sensory-motor processes;analog processing;discrete space;continuous neurodynamic systems;language-action associations;self-organizing dynamic structures;interactive learning;robotic simulations;nonlinear dynamic phenomena;bifurcations;chaotic dynamics;perceptual reality","","22","","72","","19 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This coupled model is used to investigate the influence of uncertainty in the electrical properties of brain tissue and encapsulation tissue, formed around the electrode after implantation, on the suppression of oscillatory neural activity during DBS. The resulting uncertainty in this effect of DBS on the network activity is quantified using a computationally efficient and non-intrusive stochastic approach based on the generalized Polynomial Chaos. The results suggest that variations in the electrical properties of brain tissue may have a substantial influence on the level of suppression of oscillatory activity during DBS. Applying a global sensitivity analysis on the suppression of the simulated oscillatory activity showed that the influence of uncertainty in the electrical properties of the encapsulation tissue had only a minor influence, in agreement with previous experimental and computational studies investigating the mechanisms of current-controlled DBS in the literature.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2608925","DFG (German Science Foundation) Research Training Group 1505 “welisa.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565541","Deep brain stimulation (DBS);finite element method;neural network models;uncertainty quantification","Brain modeling;Satellite broadcasting;Computational modeling;Axons;Electrodes","bioelectric phenomena;bioelectric potentials;biological tissues;biomedical electrodes;brain;brain models;chaos;diseases;finite element analysis;neuromuscular stimulation;neurophysiology;physiological models;sensitivity analysis;stochastic processes","oscillation suppression;cortico-basal ganglia network;volume conductor models;deep brain stimulation;extracellular field distribution;dimensional finite element model;rodent;electrical properties;brain tissue;encapsulation tissue;oscillatory neural activity;simulated oscillatory activity;current-controlled DBS;uncertainty quantification","Animals;Basal Ganglia;Cerebral Cortex;Computer Simulation;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electrodes, Implanted;Finite Element Analysis;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Parkinson Disease;Stochastic Processes;Subthalamic Nucleus;Uncertainty","","","50","","13 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simultaneous pulse amplitudes are determined by taking into account parameters of spatial channel interaction. The computation of simultaneous amplitudes requires the solution of linear systems of equations in an iterative procedure. The computation amount can be reduced significantly, if the spatial impulse responses in individual electrodes can be approximated by two exponentially decaying branches with decay constants alpha toward apex and beta toward base. Generally, the associated inverse of the channel interaction matrix is tridiagonal. Preliminary vowel and consonant identification tests with four cochlear implant patients have been conducted for sequential and simultaneous processor settings. For equal overall pulse repetition rates, comparable speech perception scores were obtained, when the decay constants alpha and beta were set accordingly.

Panciatici","RTE, Versailles, France; RTE, Versailles, France","2014 IEEE PES General Meeting | Conference & Exposition","30 Oct 2014","2014","","","1","2","Summary form only given. Context: Security issues of the pan-European electricity transmission system are likely to become more and more challenging in the coming years due to: the growing contribution of less predictable and intermittent renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic generation) - the introduction of new controllable devices such as HVDC lines; a partially controllable electricity demand - the increasing difficulty to build new overhead transmission lines; the progressive construction of a single European electricity market. These new constraints but also new opportunities will result in more complex system operation, a grid working closer to its operational limits and therefore a need for a major revision of operational rules and procedures. In this context, it is clear that currently available tools for security assessment will no longer be suitable for network operators to take the right decisions. Furthermore, coordinated operation initiatives have already emerged for different regions of the pan-European transmission system (such as Coreso for instance). These coordination initiatives will not be fully efficient without a new generation of tools allowing the different TSOs to increase coordination. Objectives: The main goal of the iTesla project is to develop a novel toolbox able to support the operation of the pan-European grid in the coming years and to validate the different functionalities of this toolbox with datasets of increasing complexity and size. More precisely, this toolbox will support the decision-making process from two-days ahead to real time and will take up the three main following challenges:to perform accurate security assessment taking into account the dynamics of the system using time-domain simulations; to provide a risk-based assessment taking into account the different sources of uncertainties (in particular, those brought by intermittent power generation), the probabilities of contingencies and the possible failures of corrective actions; to provide operators with relevant proposals of preventive and curative actions to keep the system in a secure state (such as generation redispatching, change in transformer tap position, topology of substations, set point values of HVDC lines or phase shift transformers). This toolbox will be designed to be used by a single TSO, by a coordination center such as Coreso or by a group of TSOs working in a coordinated way.

This paper studies the coordination of multiple intelligent agents in a complicated dynamic environment with uncertainty. A coordination model based on the fuzzy Q-learning technique is suggested. This model uses fuzzy logic to generalize the agentpsilas continuous state space. Every agent, when making decisions on its actions, needs to consider the influences of other agents to the environment. The agent first evaluates the actions they select, then, uses the fuzzy Q-learning to learn their action strategy. In the process, the action keeps improving and the conflicts among agents can be resolved. This model was used in the RoboCup soccer simulation game and the simulation results showed that the performance of attacking is obviously improved.","","978-1-4244-2113-8","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593811","multi-agent system;fuzzy Q-learning;multi-agent coordination;RoboCup","Intelligent agent;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Information science;Automation;Computational modeling;Materials","decision making;fuzzy logic;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","multiagent coordination method;fuzzy Q-learning;reinforcement learning;intelligent agent;discrete state space;discrete action space;complicated dynamic environment;fuzzy logic;continuous state space;decision making;RoboCup soccer simulation game","","1","","7","","8 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even an accurate analytical dynamic model is inherently unstable because physics parameters such as inertia and friction can only be approximated. Data-driven models usually rely on large amounts of training data, but data collection is time consuming when working with real robots.In this paper, we collect all training data in a physics simulator and build an LSTM-based model to fit the pushing dynamics. Domain Randomization is applied to capture the pushing trajectories of a generalized class of objects. When executed on the real robot, the trained recursive model adapts to the tracked object's real dynamics within a few steps. We propose the algorithm Recurrent Model Predictive Path Integral (RMPPI) as a variation of the original MPPI approach, employing state-dependent recurrent models. As a comparison, we also train a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) network as a model-free baseline, which is also used as the action generator in the data collection phase. During policy training, Hindsight Experience Replay is used to improve exploration efficiency. Pushing experiments on our UR5 platform demonstrate the model's adaptability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341076","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341076","","Training;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Training data;Predictive models;Data models;Task analysis","adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-robot systems;neurocontrollers;recurrent neural nets","accurate analytical dynamic model;physics parameters;inertia;friction;data-driven models;training data;physics simulator;LSTM-based model;pushing dynamics;Domain Randomization;pushing trajectories;trained recursive model adapts;tracked object;algorithm Recurrent Model Predictive Path Integral;state-dependent recurrent models;Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient network;model-free baseline;data collection phase;policy training;pushing experiments;object pushing;planar pushing;core issue","","","","28","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Encoding of Motion Targets by Waves in Turtle Visual Cortex","X. Du; B. K. Ghosh; P. Ulinski","Fundamental Sci. Div., Pacific Northwest Nat. Lab., Richland, WA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","17 Jul 2006","2006","53","8","1688","1695","Visual stimuli evoke wave activity in the visual cortex of freshwater turtles. Earlier work from our laboratory showed that information about the positions of stationary visual stimuli is encoded in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the waves and that the waves can be decoded using Bayesian detection theory. This paper extends these results in three ways. First, it shows that flashes of light separated in space and time and stimuli moving with three speeds can be discriminated statistically using the waves generated in a large-scale model of the cortex. Second, it compares the coding capabilities of spike rate and spike time codes. Spike rate codes were obtained by low-pass filtering the activities of individual neurons in the model with filters of different band widths. For the moving targets used in the study, detectability using spike rate codes is immune to the choice of a specific bandwidth, indicating that a coarse filter is able to adequately discriminate targets. Spike timing codes are binary sequences indicating the precise timing of spike activity of individual neurons across the cortex. Spike time codes generally perform better than do spike rate codes. Third, the encoding process is examined in terms of the underlying cellular mechanisms that result in the initiation, propagation and cessation of the wave. The period of peak detectability corresponds to the period in which waves are propagating across the cortex","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.877796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658164","Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition;motion encoding;Statistical hypothesis testing;turtle visual cortex","Encoding;Low pass filters;Brain modeling;Neurons;Timing;Laboratories;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Decoding;Bayesian methods;Space time codes","Bayes methods;biology computing;brain;cellular biophysics;encoding;low-pass filters;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;spatiotemporal phenomena;visual evoked potentials","motion target encoding;wave activity;turtle visual cortex;stationary visual stimuli;spatiotemporal dynamics;Bayesian detection theory;large-scale model of the cortex;spike rate;spike time codes;low-pass filtering;neurons;encoding;cellular mechanisms","Action Potentials;Animals;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Neurological;Motion Perception;Neurons;Photic Stimulation;Turtles;Visual Cortex","5","","15","","17 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed GrADP method, a goal representation network is introduced to generate an adaptive internal reinforcement signal to the critic network to help the controller provide a general mapping between the input and output actions. Moreover, in the proposed architecture, the action network in the GrADP is improved by using the fuzzy hyperbolic model, which combines the merits of the fuzzy model and the neural network model. Based on the back-propagation technique, the parameters in the membership functions and the fuzzy rules are all undergo training and online adapting. The proposed controller is tested on two numerical benchmarks, and the simulation results show that the proposed controller outperforms the original adaptive dynamic fuzzy controller and the pure neural network-based GrADP controller. In addition, the proposed controller is further applied on a large multimachine power system for static var compensator damping control, where simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on real applications. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the theoretical guarantee of the proposed method, Lyapunov stability analysis to support the proposed Fuzzy-GrADP approach has also been carried out.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2505327","National Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346472","Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP);fuzzy hyperbolic model (FHM);goal representation adaptive dynamic programming (GrADP);internal goal representation;multimachine power systems;stability analysis","Dynamic programming;Power system stability;Adaptive systems;Adaptation models;Damping;Mathematical model;Nonlinear systems","adaptive control;dynamic programming;fuzzy control;learning systems;Lyapunov methods;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;stability","goal representation adaptive dynamic programming;GrADP method;nonlinear learning controller;adaptive internal reinforcement signal;critic network;general mapping;action network;fuzzy hyperbolic model;membership functions;numerical benchmarks;adaptive dynamic fuzzy controller;pure neural network-based GrADP controller;large multimachine power system;static var compensator damping control;Lyapunov stability analysis","","34","","67","","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its generalized framework, adaptive submodularity, has later been introduced to deal with uncertainty and partially observability, achieving near-optimal performance with simple greedy policies. As a consequence, adaptive submodularity is in principle a promising candidate for efficient touch-based localization in robotics. However, applying that method directly on the motion level shows poor scaling with the dimensionality of the system. Being motivated by hierarchical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) planning, we integrate an action hierarchy into the existing adaptive submodularity framework. The proposed algorithm is expected to effectively generate uncertainty-reducing actions with the help from an action hierarchy. Experimental results on both, a simulated robot and a Willow Garage PR2 platform, demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.","","978-1-4799-6885-5","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363566","","Robot sensing systems;Uncertainty;Trajectory;Optimization;Planning;Yttrium","decision making;entropy;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;observability;robots;tactile sensors","Willow Garage PR2 platform;simulated robot;uncertainty-reducing actions;adaptive submodularity framework;partially observable Markov decision process planning;robotics;touch-based localization;greedy policies;near-optimal performance;observability;sequential decision making;machine learning;entropy-related objectives;sequential submodular optimization;touch based POMDP manipulation","","3","","20","","28 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

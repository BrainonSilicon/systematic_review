In robotics, interactive perception defines a set of algorithms that leverage actions to improve the perception of the environment, and vice versa use perception to guide the next action. Scene interactions are difficult to model, therefore, most of the current systems use predefined heuristics. This limits their ability to efficiently search for the target object in a complex environment. In order to remove heuristics and the need for explicit models of the interactions, in this work we propose a reinforcement learning based active and interactive perception system for scene exploration and object search. We evaluate our work both in simulated and in real-world experiments using a robotic manipulator equipped with an RGB and a depth camera, and compare our system to two baselines. The results indicate that our approach, trained in simulation only, transfers smoothly to reality and can solve the object finding task efficiently and with more than 88% success rate.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197101","","Cameras;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems;Search problems;Clutter;Detectors","cameras;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;object recognition;robot vision;search problems","object finding;cases physical interaction;target object;complex environment;object search;cluttered scenes interactions;reinforcement learning based active perception system;reinforcement learning based interactive perception system;robotic manipulator;RGB;depth camera","","1","","40","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to address the bottleneck of human workload capacity, highly automated safety-critical systems are under development to support air traffic controllers. However, the transfer of tasks and capabilities from a human agent to an automated agent is not without its pitfalls. Human controllers provide safe, efficient, and creative problem-solving in conflict situations-situations that often are outside the abilities of an automated system. In order for controllers to best use their creative problem-solving skills in safety-critical situations, automated agents must shoulder `routine' activities contributing to controller workload in the current-day system, such as housekeeping tasks and basic separation assurance activities. The detection and resolution of conflicts required for basic separation assurance is the primary contributor to current day workload, since it requires controllers have an awareness of all aircraft to produce effective solutions. However in high-traffic airspace (e.g., 30+ aircraft in a sector), full situation awareness becomes impossible without automated assistance. While research on the automation of conflict detection and resolution is fairly well established, questions remain concerning the give and take between the responsibilities of the human controller and those of the automated agent. Discussed here is a portion of a larger human-in-the-loop experiment examining controllers' transition through four hypothetical automation stages of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). This portion, called Maximum NextGen, simulated a fully automated environment where the automation was responsible for detecting and resolving conflicts within simulation parameters in high-density airspace. The human moved to primarily a supervisory position: typically only assuming control over separation assurance tasks during conflict situations deferred by the automation. While tasks were allocated a-priori between the controller and automated agent, controllers maintained authority to inhibit the automation from interacting with particular aircraft. This analysis focuses on the circumstances surrounding controller's inhibitory actions upon the automation, postulating about their reasons for doing so based on contextual similarities, ultimately identifying preliminary trends for both further research and automation refinement.","2155-7209","978-1-4799-5001-0","10.1109/DASC.2014.6979409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979409","","Automation;Aircraft;Air traffic control;Keyboards;Problem-solving;Market research","aerospace safety;air traffic control;aircraft control;safety-critical software","aircraft control;automation refinement;next generation air transportation system;automated safety-critical system;air traffic density;National Airspace System;maximum NextGen condition;automated conflict resolutions;controller inhibition","","1","","10","","11 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many approaches have been proposed to provide assistance for human resource allocation in view of minimizing project duration and project cost or maximizing revenue and efficiency. These approaches may sometimes not be comprehensive in real-world environments without addressing some key factors like transferring cost, communication, and negative efficiency, which usually have crucial impacts on assignment applicability. This article is proposing a framework for assisting a software company to evaluate existing resource for making decisions on whether the estimation of the tender is feasible, and assisting to make human resource allocation for team formation in fixed project duration with labor skill and budget constraint. Within consideration of both the cost and the efficiency, the performance is maximized to verges on the customers' expectations in software development project management on the basis of a real case. Before forming a team for a specific project with well-defined periods and numbers of people with different project roles, the values of key factors in the framework are calculated with individual foundation of computation. We formulate the decision process in integer programming models, and a simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model to assist the decision making process of software companies for team formation. The results of four variants for maximum skill efficiency or minimum hiring cost are illustrated with different considerations of both key factors are included or not proposed in this paper, and demonstrate that these factors could bring out different sources to help companies in making further evaluations for allocating staff in a software development project.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9007363","Project management;human resource allocation;team formation;software project;integer programming","Software;Resource management;Task analysis;Project management;Companies;Computational modeling;Estimation","decision making;DP industry;human resource management;integer programming;personnel;project management;resource allocation;software development management;software houses","integer programming models;decision making;software company;decision model;software companies;software development project management;project cost;project duration minimization;cost estimation;human resource allocation","","1","","57","CCBY","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the placement of implants is not without risk due to anatomically complex operation sites in the cranio-maxillofacial region. Therefore, in the field of oral implantology, there is a trend towards computer-aided implant surgery. In this study, an integrated surgical planning and virtual training system is presented. With the introduction of DLL (Dynamic Link Libraries) and some well-known free, open source software libraries such as VTK, ITK, and QT, a modular software named CAPPOIS (Computer Assisted Preoperative Planning for Oral Implant Surgery) was developed for preoperative planning, including medical image importing, image segmentation and 3D-Reconstruction, 2D/3D geometrical measurements, optimization design of the position and orientation of oral implants, etc. Then, the following virtual surgical training system is developed based on the force feedback haptic device, i.e., Omega.3, and the software toolkit of CHAI3D. With the use of this system, the resulting data of the preoperative planning can be transferred, and surgical simulation of the plan can be vividly realized. In this way, the surgeon can grasp the feel of osteotomy procedure, gain experience and therefore improve his skills during the actual dental implant surgery. This pilot study proves helpful for the inexperienced surgeons; however, more clinical cases will be conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and reliability.","","978-1-4244-5858-5","10.1109/ICALIP.2010.5685115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685115","","Surgery;Implants;Solid modeling;Planning;Three dimensional displays;Training;Software","dentistry;force feedback;haptic interfaces;medical computing;prosthetics;software libraries","integrated surgical planning;virtual training system;force feedback haptic device;dental implant surgery;cranio-maxillofacial region;oral implantology;computer-aided implant surgery;DLL;dynamic link libraries;open source software libraries;VTK;ITK;QT;CAPPOIS;computer assisted preoperative planning;oral implant surgery;osteotomy procedure","","7","","12","","10 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, because such infrastructure's performance is very crucial in practical use since the scientific legacy applications simulate instances in a long period of time, we improve the UTF by applying Message Passing based Parallelization and parallel I/O operations. Furthermore, due to the scientific code has enormous state data and the I/O capacity on the server is limited, we apply in situ data analysis method to encounter fewer resource limitations, and adopt signal processing to greatly reduce data transfer.

The control parameters are derived from the solution of a convex optimization problem. The approach complements previous work of transferable skill-based programming for robotic assembly in particular.

As such, Data Intensive (DI) applications are becoming more and more important and critical. They must be fault-tolerant, they should scale with the amount of data, and be able to elastically leverage additional resources as and when these last ones are provided [3]. Moreover, they should be able to avoid data drops introduced in case of sudden overloads and should offer some Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Ensuring all these properties is, per se, a challenge, but it becomes even more difficult for DI applications, given the large amount of data to be managed and the significant level of parallelism required for its components. Even if today some technological frameworks are available for the development of such applications (for instance, think of Spark, Storm, Flink), we still lack solid software engineering approaches to support their development and, in particular, to ensure that they offer the required properties in terms of availability, throughput, data loss, etc. In fact, at the time of writing, identifying the right solution can require several rounds of experiments and the adoption of many different technologies. This implies the need for highly skilled persons and the execution of experiments with large data sets and a large number of resources, and, consequently, a significant amount of time and budget. To experiment with currently available approaches, we performed an action research experiment focusing on developing- testing-reengineering a specific DI application, Hegira4Cloud, that migrates data between widely used NoSQL databases, including so-called Database as a Service (DaaS), as well as on-premise databases. This is a representative DI system because it has to handle large volumes of data with different structures and has to guarantee that some important characteristics, in terms of data types and transactional properties, are preserved. Also, it poses stringent requirements in terms of correctness, high performance, fault tolerance, and fast and effective recovery. In our action research, we discovered that the literature offered some high level design guidelines for DI applications, as well as some tools to support modelling and QoS analysis/simulation of complex architectures, however the available tools were not yet. suitable to support DI systems. Moreover, we realized that the available big data frameworks we could have used were not flexible enough to cope with all possible application-specific aspects of our system. Hence, to achieve the desired level of performance, fault tolerance and recovery, we had to adopt a time-consuming, experiment-based approach [1, 6], which, in our case, consisted of three iterations: (1) the design and implementation of a Mediation Data Model capable of managing data extracted from different databases, together with a first monholitical prototype of Hegira4Cloud; (2) the improvement of performance of our prototype when managing and transferring huge amounts of data; (3) the introduction of fault-tolerant data extraction and management mechanisms, which are independent from the targeted databases. Among the others, an important issue that has forced us to reiterate in the development of Hegira4Cloud concerned the DaaS we interfaced with. In particular these DaaS, which are well-known services with a large number of users: (1) were missing detailed information regarding the behaviour of their APIs; (2) did not offer a predictable service; (3) were suffering of random downtimes not correlated with the datasets we were experimenting with. In this journal first presentation, we describe our experience and the issues we encountered that led to some important decisions during the software design and engineering process. Also, we analyse the state of the art of software design and verification tools and approaches in the light of our experience, and identify weaknesses, alternative design approaches and open challenges that could generate new research in these areas.

SD Mask R-CNN outperforms point cloud clustering baselines by an absolute 15% in Average Precision and 20% in Average Recall on COCO benchmarks, and achieves performance levels similar to a Mask R-CNN trained on a massive, hand-labeled RGB dataset and fine-tuned on real images from the experimental setup.

In these circumstances, we can leverage tactile feedback between the gripper and the environment. In this paper, we present learnable Bayes filter models that can localize robotic grippers using tactile feedback. We propose a novel observation model that conditions the tactile feedback on visual maps of the environment along with a motion model to recursively estimate the gripper’s location.

The improvements arise by combining parameter constraints derived from model-based dynamical-thermodynamical-hydrological (DTH) meteorological profile variables and additional geographical-seasonal (GS) factors, together with multispectral PMW brightness temperatures (TBs), into a specialized knowledge database underpinning a Bayesian retrieval algorithm. The so-called knowledge variables are produced by a high-resolution nonhydrostatic cloud-resolving model (CRM). The associated knowledge TBs are produced by a calibrated PMW radiative-transfer-equation model system (RMS) that relates CRM environments to expected satellite-view top-of-atmosphere TBs. By first applying the RMS to thousands of meteorological-microphysical situations simulated by the CRM and then by marshaling into the specialized database all the concomitant modeled microphysical profiles, TBs, and linked DTH/GS profiles/factors (from which optimal constraint tags can be derived), it becomes possible to use the database for the Bayesian interpretation of analogous measured TBs and tags. The main purpose of the new algorithm is to reduce ambiguity (nonuniqueness) effects that plague predecessor CRD algorithms. Such schemes restrict the interpretation of observed TBs by ignoring observable DTH/GS parameters that help constrain the influence microphysical profile sets (i.e., the associated hydrometeors, their size distributions, and their concomitant vertical distributions) that feed into the retrieval solutions. A Version 1 CDRD algorithm is tested against its CRD predecessor on two case studies of precipitation over Italy's Lazio region which were observed with various satellite PMW radiometers. The measured TBs and corresponding tags obtained from gridded operational global model analyses are used in juxtaposition to produce the final rainfall retrievals. The retrievals are verified against coincident precision polarimetric C-band radar measurements. Skillful improvement is found for a case of intense convective rainfall where even CRD-type algorithm accuracy should be expected, as well as for a case of mixed convective-stratiform rainfall where either algorithms might otherwise be expected to be somewhat inaccurate.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410415","Atmospheric remote sensing;Bayesian precipitation retrieval;Cloud Radiation Database (CRD)/Cloud Dynamics and Radiation Database (CDRD) algorithms;passive microwave (PMW) radiometer;satellite rainfall retrieval","Databases;Bayesian methods;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Microwave radiometry;Clouds;Vectors","Bayes methods;clouds;geophysical techniques;radar polarimetry;rain;remote sensing by radar","CRD algorithm;CDRD algorithm;Bayesian rainfall retrieval;satellite passive microwave measurement;Cloud Dynamics and Radiation Database algorithm;PMW radiometer measurement;Cloud Radiation Database algorithm;dynamical-thermodynamical-hydrological meteorological profile variables;geographical-seasonal factors;brightness temperature;cloud resolving model;microphysical profile;polarimetric C-band radar measurement","","28","","85","","14 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional detection approaches are not optimized because the staff involved in this process although skilled and experimented, requires a long time for a safe and for an efficient detection that uses costly and accurate equipments. Therefore, some research are actually focusing on using wireless sensors networks for this purpose hoping that faster, safer, more accurate and more cost-effective methods will be found. Within this context, this work considers a network made of wireless biosensors randomly spread over the landmines field. It presents a comparative study on the energy consumption when different scenarios of data transfer are adopted. Simulation results are obtained in order to help in finding the optimal solution where the minimum data is lost, the minimum energy is consumed and the minimum redundant data is collected.","","978-1-4673-1291-2","10.1109/ICWCUCA.2012.6402486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402486","","Energy consumption;Wireless sensor networks;Broadcasting;Clocks;Landmine detection;Mathematical model;Temperature measurement","biosensors;landmine detection;wireless sensor networks","energy consumption;wireless biosensors;landmine detection;comparative study;wireless sensors networks;cost-effective methods;minimum data","","","","10","","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Result of the project is a software framework that includes an “offline framework” with features such as model-based automatic coverage planning for complex parts, automatic robot program generation and an “inline framework” that deals with sensor data mapping to transfer sensor measurements to the 3D object model. At the heart of the project is an accurate process-specific model that represents the sensor data acquisition process. This representation is sufficiently accurate to allow automatic planning in off-line settings using simulated workcells and then reproducing the inspection procedure on the real one, with some adaptations and corrections. More in detail, the “offline framework” will include a generic interface to allow the easy exchange of process models (for different inspection technologies), of the CAD model of the part (for a different type of product to be inspected) or of the work-cell model (for a different robot kinematic structure). The generic “inline framework” will provide the backbone for the execution of the actual inspection process. Relying on such a proven frameworks will reduce the risks of implementing complex inspection tasks and thus help the deployment of inspection robots. In this work initial results from the two main use cases are presented, they consist of inspection tasks for the automotive and aerospace industry respectively.","","978-1-7281-4892-2","10.1109/MetroInd4.0IoT48571.2020.9138179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9138179","inspection robots;machine vision;quality inspection","","CAD;control engineering computing;data acquisition;industrial robots;inspection;production engineering computing;robot dynamics;robot kinematics;robot programming","SPIRIT;software framework;industrial inspection robots;sensor data mapping;sensor measurements;3D object model;sensor data acquisition process;CAD model;work-cell model;robot kinematic structure;process-specific model;inline framework","","","","10","","10 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we introduce Meta Strategy Optimization, a metalearning algorithm for training policies with latent variable inputs that can quickly adapt to new scenarios with a handful of trials in the target environment. The key idea behind MSO is to expose the same adaptation process, Strategy Optimization (SO), to both the training and testing phases. This allows MSO to effectively learn locomotion skills as well as a latent space that is suitable for fast adaptation. We evaluate our method on a real quadruped robot and demonstrate successful adaptation in various scenarios, including sim-to-real transfer, walking with a weakened motor, or climbing up a slope. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the generalization capability of the trained policy in simulated environments. Both real and simulated experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods in adaptation to novel tasks.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2020.2974685","Wenhao's internship at Robotics at Google; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001157","Deep learning in robotics and automation;learning and adaptive systems;legged robots","Optimization;Training;Legged locomotion;Adaptation models;Physics;Task analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);legged locomotion;optimisation;robot dynamics","meta strategy optimization;real-world applications;trained policy;successful adaptation;quadruped robot;fast adaptation;latent space;testing phases;adaptation process;MSO;target environment;latent variable inputs;training policies;metalearning algorithm;legged robots","","3","","45","IEEE","18 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The strategy is composed by the following ingredients: 2 inertial sensors attached to the human arm and forearm, the differential kinematics (DK) as well as the dynamic model of the corresponding robot and a motion control scheme. We use inertial sensors to obtain the orientation measurements of the human bodies in real-time. These body parameters together with the DK module allow us to map human hand trajectories into the joint space of the robot, where a standard PID control is implemented. Overall our strategy is able to transfer motion skills from human to a given robot by means of an online inertial sensor-guided motion control. Moreover, our method can be used for robot teleoperation applications in a master-slave configuration, with a human interface based on inertial sensors. We have successfully validated in simulations the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in a 2 degrees of freedom (dof) planar robot.","2155-1782","978-1-4244-7709-8","10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5625997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625997","","Robot sensing systems;Humans;Joints;Tracking;Trajectory","biomechanics;motion control;robot kinematics;telerobotics;three-term control","online inertial sensor-guided motion control;human arm movement tracking;robots;forearm;differential kinematics;motion control;PID control;robot teleoperation;master-slave configuration;human interface","","4","","14","","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The techniques used for these robotic vehicles in the field of sensors, sensor data processing and control offer enormous potential to improve in integrated drive assistance systems the safety aspects of future cars in the streets. The team of the University Wuerzburg was involved in Mars Rover developments for the European Space Agency ESA and transferred similar navigation and tele-operation techniques also to industrial transport rovers and to remotely controlled rovers for harsh environments (by example to support fire fighters in search and rescue operations during emergencies). Related assistance systems support the tele-operator in situation awareness to more reliably detect obstacles and dangers. The vehicle should be able to handle difficult situations autonomously, like obstacle avoidance and a return to the base, in particular when the radio link is lost. Interesting progress in sensor systems (new principles like PMD-camera, future navigation systems like Galileo, ...), in miniaturization, in man-machine interfaces (like augmented reality approaches) and sensor data processing provide here exciting perspectives for innovations. Assistance systems enable a range of scalable reactions, which initiate appropriate actions adapted to the specific situation and to the operatorpsilas skills. As specific example the assistance system of University Wuerzburg will be presented, which was the winner of the ldquourban scenariordquo competition at ELROB 2007, where in a city environment hidden markers were to be detected and identified.","","978-4-907764-30-2","10.1109/SICE.2008.4654608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654608","","","collision avoidance;mobile robots;telerobotics","robotic vehicles;sensor data processing;integrated drive assistance systems;industrial transport rovers;remotely controlled rovers;obstacle avoidance;man-machine interfaces","","1","","","","21 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

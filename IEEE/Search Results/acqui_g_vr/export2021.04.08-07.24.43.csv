To acquire the parametric image, a long dynamic scan over 80 mins are necessary, however, some patients with severe diseases cannot stay in a scanner such a long time or can produce bad motion artifacts during the dynamic scan. To address this issue, we propose a novel parametric PET reconstruction method using a dual injection strategy. The dual injection strategy is that the first injection of half dose at the beginning and the second injection of half dose at the middle of scan are administered, which can preserve total amount of dose. A scan is conducted after 60 mins from the first injection with a duration of total 20 mins as usually done in PET scan protocol. To estimate the parametric image, we firstly split the first and last time activity curves (TACs), and then a parametric image is estimated using partial dynamic data based on the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). To split the TACs, a linear fitting method is used by assuming that there is no temporal metabolite changes and TAC with 20 min in the steady-state is linear. For the accurate estimation of parametric image, a penalized direct reconstruction method is proposed in which a penalty is imposed in parametric images. In brain phantom simulation, we demonstrated that the proposed method can estimate the parametric image only using 20 min acquisition.","2577-0829","978-1-7281-4164-0","10.1109/NSS/MIC42101.2019.9060064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060064","","Kinetic theory;Estimation;Image reconstruction;Positron emission tomography;Steady-state;Dynamics","brain;diseases;image reconstruction;medical image processing;phantoms;positron emission tomography","linear fitting method;simplified reference tissue model;dual injection short time parametric PET image;PET scan protocol;dual injection strategy;parametric PET reconstruction method;parametric positron emission tomography imaging;time 80.0 min;time 60.0 min;time 20.0 min","","","","7","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors describe novel methods for economically ascertaining probability distributions under the null hypothesis, with fewer assumptions, by permutation of the observed data. Nominal Type I error control by permutation testing is generally excellent; whereas theoretical distributions may be over conservative. Permutation has the additional advantage that it can be used to test any statistic of interest, such as the sum of suprathreshold voxel statistics in a cluster (or cluster mass), regardless of its theoretical tractability under the null hypothesis.

While MRI and X-ray radiography were integrated before, we propose novel designs to acquire simultaneous CT and MR views for synchronized radiographic imaging or joint tomographic reconstruction. Our preliminary permanent magnet configurations achieve a magnetic field strength between 0.1 and 0.2 T while keeping weight low enough for portability. We have also shown that a field strength up to 0.35 T is achievable with permanent magnets that maintain a compact profile, though increased weight would hinder ease of transportation.

However, because of the ill-posed nature and sensitivity to noise of the inverse problem, it is a challenge to develop a robust reconstruction method, which can accurately locate the stem cells and define the distribution. In this paper, we proposed a sparsity adaptive correntropy matching pursuit (SACMP) method. SACMP method is independent on the noise distribution of measurements and it assigns small weights on severely corrupted entries of data and large weights on clean ones adaptively. These properties make it more suitable for in vivo experiment. To analyze the performance in terms of robustness and practicability of SACMP, we conducted numerical simulation and in vivo mice experiments. The results demonstrated that the SACMP method obtained the highest robustness and accuracy in locating stem cells and depicting stem cell distribution compared with stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit and sparsity adaptive subspace pursuit reconstruction methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that acquired such accurate and robust FMT distribution reconstruction for stem cell tracking in mice brain.

Accurate acquisition of fetal standard planes with key anatomical structures is very crucial for substantial biometric measurement and diagnosis. However, the standard plane acquisition is a labor-intensive task and requires operator equipped with a thorough knowledge of fetal anatomy. Therefore, automatic approaches are highly demanded in clinical practice to alleviate the workload and boost the examination efficiency. The automatic detection of standard planes from US videos remains a challenging problem due to the high intraclass and low interclass variations of standard planes, and the relatively low image quality. Unlike previous studies which were specifically designed for individual anatomical standard planes, respectively, we present a general framework for the automatic identification of different standard planes from US videos. Distinct from conventional way that devises hand-crafted visual features for detection, our framework explores in- and between-plane feature learning with a novel composite framework of the convolutional and recurrent neural networks. To further address the issue of limited training data, a multitask learning framework is implemented to exploit common knowledge across detection tasks of distinctive standard planes for the augmentation of feature learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on hundreds of US fetus videos to corroborate the better efficacy of the proposed framework on the difficult standard plane detection problem.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2017.2685080","National Basic Research Program of China, 973 Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890445","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;knowledge transfer;recurrent neural network (RNN);standard plane;ultrasound (US)","Standards;Fetus;Videos;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Training data;Machine learning","biomedical ultrasonics;convolution;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;obstetrics;recurrent neural nets;ultrasonic imaging;video signal processing","ultrasound standard plane detection;composite neural network framework;ultrasound imaging;obstetric examination;fetal standard plane acquisition;substantial biometric measurement;fetal anatomy;in-plane feature learning;between-plane feature learning;convolutional neural networks;recurrent neural networks;multitask learning framework;US fetus videos","Algorithms;Female;Fetus;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Neural Networks (Computer);Pregnancy;Ultrasonography, Prenatal;Video Recording","42","2","63","","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further constraints are added to ensure that the conformal map is unique. Empirical tests on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data show that the mappings preserve angular relationships, are stable in MRIs acquired at different times, and are robust to differences in data triangulation, and resolution.

Both the received signal of each coil and its sensitivity map, which describes its spatial response, are needed during reconstruction. Widely used schemes such as SENSE assume that sensitivity maps of the coils are noiseless while the only errors are in coil outputs. In practice, however, sensitivity maps are subject to a wide variety of errors. At first glance, sensitivity noise appears to result in an errors-in-variables problem of the kind that is typically solved using total least squares (TLSs). However, existing TLS algorithms are in general inappropriate for the specific type of block structure that arises in parallel imaging. In this paper, we take a maximum likelihood approach to the problem of parallel imaging in the presence of independent Gaussian sensitivity noise. This results in a quasi-quadratic objective function, which can be efficiently minimized. Experimental evidence suggests substantial gains over conventional SENSE, especially in nonideal imaging conditions like low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high g-factors and large acceleration, using sensitivity maps suffering from misalignment, ringing, and random noise.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2007.897364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4280897","Magnetic resonance (MR);maximum likelihood (ML);parallel imaging;SENSE;total least squares (TLSs)","Coils;Signal to noise ratio;Radiology;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic noise;Image reconstruction;Biomedical imaging;Least squares methods;Acceleration;Magnetic resonance","biomedical MRI;coils;Gaussian noise;image denoising;image reconstruction;maximum likelihood estimation;medical image processing;random noise","random noise;g-factors;signal-to-noise ratio;quasiquadratic objective function;Gaussian sensitivity noise;errors-in-variables problem;sensitivity maps;SENSE;image reconstruction;spatial response;magnetic resonance image acquisition;coil sensitivity noise;parallel imaging;maximum likelihood approach","Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain;Computer Simulation;Equipment Failure;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Likelihood Functions;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Transducers","8","1","28","","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The high-dimensional glove signals remotely control the joint angles of a simulated planar two-link arm on a computer screen, which is used to acquire targets. A machine learning algorithm was applied to adaptively change the transformation between finger motion and the simulated robot arm. This algorithm was either LMS gradient descent or the Moore-Penrose (MP) pseudoinverse transformation. Both algorithms modified the glove-to-joint angle map so as to reduce the endpoint errors measured in past performance. The MP group performed worse than the control group (subjects not exposed to any machine learning), while the LMS group outperformed the control subjects. However, the LMS subjects failed to achieve better generalization than the control subjects, and after extensive training converged to the same level of performance as the control subjects.

We propose the novel use of a pre-trained denoiser as a regularizer in a model-based reconstruction for the recovery of highly under-sampled data. Specifically, we designed the denoiser based on a general diffusion MRI tissue microstructure model for multi-compartmental modeling. By using a wide range of biologically plausible parameter values for the multi-compartmental microstructure model, we simulated diffusion signal that spans the entire microstructure parameter space. A neural network was trained in an unsupervised manner using an autoencoder to learn the diffusion MRI signal subspace. We employed the autoencoder in a model-based reconstruction and show that the autoencoder provides a strong denoising prior to recover the q-space signal. We show reconstruction results on a simulated brain dataset that shows high acceleration capabilities of the proposed method.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-9330-8","10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9098593","K-q space deep learning;diffusion MRI;autoencoder;model-based deep learning","Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Acceleration;Data models;Brain modeling;Biological system modeling;Image resolution","biodiffusion;biological tissues;biomedical MRI;brain;image denoising;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","multicompartmental microstructure model;diffusion MRI signal subspace;high-resolution diffusion MRI;model-based deep learning architecture;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;high-resolution imaging;diffusion weighted images;under-sampled acquisition;parallel MRI setting;microstructure parameter space;diffusion MRI tissue microstructure model;multicompartmental modeling;model-based reconstruction","","1","","12","","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulations (ideal conditions), phantom experiments, and six patient studies have been carried out with the mobile system using a 40/spl deg/ rotating slant hole collimator (general purpose). Reconstructed section images from simulations and patient studies have been compared to SPECT. Ectomographic and SPECT simulations give similar images. Phantom experiments using a 3D brain phantom show that the optimal acquisition geometry is with the detector parallel to the orbito-meatal plane. In patient studies, the Ectomographic images were similar to the SPECT images obtained using a collimator with ultra high resolution. There were however differences which have to be investigated further. In conclusion, the results obtained indicate that it is feasible to use Ectomography for CBF studies, especially if a high resolution collimator is used.","1082-3654","0-7803-5021-9","10.1109/NSSMIC.1998.773824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=773824","","Blood flow;Imaging phantoms;Image reconstruction;Collimators;High-resolution imaging;Brain modeling;Cameras;Detectors;Image resolution;Myocardium","brain;blood flow measurement;emission tomography","cerebral blood flow imaging;ectomography;acute studies;mobile system;40/spl deg/ rotating slant hole collimator;reconstructed section images;SPECT;phantom experiments;3D brain phantom;optimal acquisition geometry;orbitomeatal plane;ultra high resolution collimator;nuclear medicine;medical diagnostic imaging;ultra high resolution","","1","","6","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The signature of drifting sensitivity and centre-of-rotation in SPM analysis of multi-head gammacamera brain SPECT and a method of correction","L.

A distinctive asymmetry was evident in the distribution of focal differences in the SPM maps. The source of this asymmetry was investigated by simulating calibration errors in the projections from one camera head of 30 scans of a 90 scan normal database, reconstructing them and using SPM to detect differences between the modified 30 and the remaining 60 scans. Two different calibration errors were simulated: either an increase by 10% in count levels to simulate differential sensitivity, or an offset of 1 pixel (3.5 mm) in X or Y to simulate an incorrect centre of rotation (COR). Error simulations were performed for both 3-head and 2-head cameras. The affect of a simulated 10% increase in sensitivity in head 3 of 3 most closely resembled the observed SPM difference image and we concluded that a drift in sensitivity had caused the observed SPM differences. In general, simulated sensitivity changes in one head caused an asymmetry in the SPM map centred on the mid acquisition angle for that head for both 3-head and 2-head systems. The blurring caused by the simulation of a 1 pixel COR error in 1 head did not translate into significant SPM differences between the two populations. Although an asymmetric clinical SPM result may be valid, it should be regarded with suspicion and the beta difference image computed to check whether the asymmetry is aligned with a single camera head. After applying an inverse correction derived from the SPM beta images to the affected normal controls, a repeat SPM analysis showed no significant difference. This method may be suitable for correction and subsequent use of databases from different cameras and institutions.","1082-3654","978-1-4244-0922-8","10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4437095","SPECT;SPM;artifact;sensitivity;center-ofrotation;drift","Scanning probe microscopy;Head;Cameras;Calibration;Gamma ray detection;Gamma ray detectors;Brain modeling;Databases;Image reconstruction;Computational modeling","brain;calibration;error analysis;gamma-ray apparatus;single photon emission computed tomography;statistical analysis","transient drift sensitivity;multihead gamma camera brain SPECT analysis;SPM analysis;calibration errors;error simulations;centre-of-rotation error;inverse correction method;statistical parametric mapping;normal controls","","1","","5","","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, episodic memory is the basis of our memories. In this paper, we propose an episodic memory model which adopts the physiological findings of the hippocampus. Episodic memory can be regarded as a temporal sequence of patterns. In general, such a sequence may have some patterns which appear several times in it, or plural temporal sequences may share some same patterns with each other. That is, it is indispensable for the episodic memory model to handle one-to-many association and context. In the proposed model, the neurogenesis in dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to build different representations in CA3 for the same input patterns, and facilitates one-to-many association. Moreover, the asymmetric spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity introduced to the learning of recurrent collateral in CA3 enables memory of context.

Consequently, in order to recover diagnostically important image details, obscured due to the resolution limitations, an image restoration procedure should be applied. The present study addresses the problem of ultrasound image restoration by means of the blind-deconvolution techniques. Given an acquired ultrasound image, algorithms of this kind perform either concurrent or successive estimation of the point-spread function (PSF) of the imaging system and the original image. A blind-deconvolution algorithm is proposed, in which the PSF is recovered as a preliminary stage of the restoration problem. As the accuracy of this estimation affects all the following stages of the image restoration, it is considered as the most fundamental and important problem. The contribution of the present study is twofold. First, it introduces a novel approach to the problem of estimating the PSF, which is based on a generalization of several fundamental concepts of the homomorphic deconvolution. It is shown that a useful estimate of the spectrum of the PSF can be obtained by applying a proper smoothing operator to both log-magnitude and phase of the spectra of acquired radio-frequency (RF) images. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach performs considerably better than the existing homomorphic (cepstrum-based) deconvolution methods. Second, the study shows that given a reliable estimate of the PSF, it is possible to deconvolve it out of the RF-image and obtain an estimate of the true tissue reflectivity function, which is relatively independent of the properties of the imaging system. The deconvolution was performed using the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for a number of statistical priors assumed for the reflectivity function. It is shown in a series of in vivo experiments that reconstructions based on the priors, which tend to emphasize the ""sparseness"" of the tissue structure, result in solutions of higher resolution and contrast.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.838326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375163","Blind deconvolution;de-noising;ultrasound;wavelet transform","Deconvolution;Ultrasonic imaging;Image restoration;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image resolution;Radio frequency;Reflectivity;Bandwidth;Biomedical transducers","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;medical image processing;image restoration;deconvolution;image resolution;optical transfer function;smoothing methods;maximum likelihood estimation","2-D blind deconvolution problem;medical ultrasound;finite frequency bandwidth;ultrasound transducers;image resolution;image restoration;point-spread function;smoothing operator;radio-frequency images;true tissue reflectivity function;maximum a-posteriori estimation;image reconstruction;image contrast","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Ultrasonography","72","3","58","","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complexity in classifying the subjective learning-skill arises because of intra- and inter-session variations in brain signals due to temporal fluctuation in activation levels of the involved brain lobes. A novel z-slice based model of general type-2 fuzzy set is proposed to represent the intra- and inter-session variations by the footprint of uncertainty and their composite variations by z-slices at different values of a given feature. Further, a novel technique for z-slice based classifier is proposed to classify the learning-skill under intra-and inter-session uncertainty.

Isotropic post-acquisition reconstruction can be obtained using super-resolution algorithms. A new MRI compatible phantom design that simulates lung tumour motion is introduced to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed super-resolution algorithm in the context of 4-D MRI. Several orthogonal low-resolution acquisitions of the phantom are performed through time using a fast true 3-D gradient echo based sequence. The acquired volumes are then registered and combined using a total-variation based regularizer super-resolution algorithm to obtain the high-resolution volume. The quality of the reconstruction is evaluated by measuring the mutual information between the reconstructed volume and a direct isotropic 3-D acquisition. Subjective and objective evaluations show the superiority of our approach compared to the averaging method.

We generalize this algorithm to account for the attenuation in the medium and the diffraction effects caused by the finite size of the transducer elements. The generalized algorithm yields higher-resolution images than those obtained with the original TR-MUSIC algorithm. We evaluate the axial and lateral resolutions of the images obtained with the generalized algorithm when noise corrupts the recorded signals and show that the axial resolution is degraded more than the lateral resolution. The TR-MUSIC algorithm is valid only when the number of point-like targets in the imaging plane is fewer than the number of transducer elements used to interrogate the medium. We remedy this shortcoming by dividing the imaging plane into subregions and applying the TR-MUSIC algorithm to the windowed backscattered signals corresponding to each subregion. The images of all subregions are then combined to form the total image. Imaging results of numerical and phantom data show that when the number of scatterers within each subregion is much smaller than the number of transducer elements, the windowing method yields super-resolution images with accurate scatterer localization. We use computer simulations and tissue-mimicking phantom data acquired with a real-time synthetic-aperture ultrasound system to illustrate the algorithms presented in the paper.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327491","","Finite element methods;Transducers;Imaging;Arrays;Image resolution;Ultrasonic imaging;Signal resolution","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;image classification;medical image processing;phantoms;ultrasonic imaging","ultrasound time-reversal MUSIC imaging;diffraction compensation;attenuation compensation;time-reversal imaging;multiple signal classification;TR-MUSIC algorithm;embedded point-like scatterer;homogeneous media;nonattenuative media;attenuation effect;diffraction effect;transducer element;generalized algorithm;axial resolution;tissue mimicking phantom data","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Phantoms, Imaging;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","21","5","30","","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we deal with the issue of how to incorporate constraints provided in the form of a high-resolution reference image which approximates the desired image. A new algorithm is described which represents the desired image using a family of basis functions derived from translated and rotated versions of the reference image. The selection of the most efficient basis function set from this family is guided by the principle of maximum cross-entropy. Simulation and experimental results have shown that the algorithm can achieve high resolution with a small number of data points while accounting for relative misregistration between the reference and measured data. The technique proves to be useful for a number of time-sequential magnetic resonance imaging applications, for which significant improvement in temporal resolution can be obtained, even as the object undergoes bulk motion during the acquisition.","","0-7803-7507-6","10.1109/SSBI.2002.1233979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233979","","Image reconstruction;Frequency measurement;Magnetic resonance;Biomedical measurements;Magnetic resonance imaging;Spatial resolution;Laboratories;Image representation;Time measurement;Discrete Fourier transforms","maximum entropy methods;image reconstruction;medical image processing;Fourier transforms;image resolution;image sequences;biomedical MRI","maximum cross-entropy;generalized series reconstruction;image reconstruction;limited Fourier data;high-resolution reference image;basis functions;time-sequential magnetic resonance imaging;temporal resolution;bulk motion","","1","2","18","","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a rule generation algorithm based on granular computing (RGAGC) is developed. RGAGC is a valid method to generate rules from the granule space. Compared with many classic decision tree algorithms, RGAGC generates a single rule granule in each step instead of selecting a suitable attribute. It is a more general algorithm for rule generation, since it could generate rules from the granule space without considering the problem of selecting an attribute according to some measure. On the other hand, in order to improve the performance of rule granule generation, the ""false preserving"" property of quotient space theory is used as a strategy to control the process of rule granule generation, so that RGAGC could generate rule granules from the granule space quickly. Our simulation experiment results prove that RGAGC is valid.","","0-7803-9017-2","10.1109/GRC.2005.1547244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1547244","granular computing;granule space;rule granule;solution space","Telecommunication computing;Gallium nitride;Switches;Machine learning;Set theory;Decision trees;Process control;Computational modeling;Grain size;Learning systems","knowledge acquisition;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);problem solving","rule generation algorithm based on granular computing;decision tree algorithms;false preserving property;quotient space theory","","1","","21","","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Neurovision®; The way to merge visual reality with navigational and military systems","G. Hector","Metamathics, Mexico City, DF (Mexico)","2013 IEEE/AIAA 32nd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","23 Jan 2014","2013","","","3D5-1","3D5-12","Historically, the extrapolation of the navigational data into what is perceived as reality by the pilot through the cockpit's window, and vice versa, has been a major source of human error during flight. Advanced computer generated terrain simulation systems provide real time virtual flights, but the pilot still needs to constantly keep checking visual reality with virtual environment and merge those on his mind. Besides, the field of view is narrow. In order to address this problem the head up display superimposes virtual and visual information. Unfortunately, angular inaccuracies related to angular vision coordinates and the changing pilot's point of view such as head position and distance to the device puts the “head up” display on need of improvement. We propose an advanced method to merge visual reality with advanced navigational systems on a wide (180°) or very wide (360°) field of view. The system is able to acquire the tridimensional visual reality as well as infrared view merged with present and future advanced navigational systems and it is also able to deliver it to the pilot in the way the human brain better understands it. The Intruder Planes Projected Trajectory and the 3D shapes of Complex Weather may also be instantaneously understood by the pilot. The exceptional capability of the system to display intruder's angular position and projected trajectories into the panoramic visual perception of the pilot is shown. Such feature may also be extended to ground or unmanned units. We call this system Neurovision®. This advanced method for stereographic projection, able to generate Riemannian manifolds facilitates and even makes some computer tasks now possible, allowing improvements derived from differential geometry and neuroscience to hopefully provide novel opportunities to avionics and technology in general. Neurovision® enables to merge Panoramic View, Infrared, Navigation Computer Generated Graphics, Complex 3D weather and Intruder's Planes or Target's Projected 3D Trajectories for every plane or military units's 3D unique visual perspective.","2155-7209","978-1-4799-1538-5","10.1109/DASC.2013.6712571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6712571","","Visualization;Azimuth;Navigation;Trajectory;Three-dimensional displays;Meteorology;Geometry","aerospace computing;aircraft displays;computer graphics;computer vision;differential geometry;extrapolation;graphical user interfaces;head-up displays;human computer interaction;human factors;military computing;military systems;stereo image processing;virtual reality","neurovision;visual reality;navigational systems;military systems;navigational data extrapolation;cockpit window;human error;advanced computer generated terrain simulation systems;real time virtual flights;head up display;intruder planes;trajectory projection;3D shapes;complex 3D weather;panoramic visual perception;stereographic projection;Riemannian manifold generation;differential geometry;navigation computer generated graphics;angular vision coordinates","","","","17","","23 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been shown that two-dimensional (2-D) quantification of soft tissue motion in the orbit is effective in the study of orbital anatomy and motion disorders. However, soft tissue motion is a three-dimensional (3-D) phenomenon and part of the kinematics is lost in any 2-D measurement. Therefore, T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging volume sequences are acquired during gaze and soft tissue motion is quantified using a generalization of the Lucas and Kanade optical flow algorithm to three dimensions. New techniques have been developed for visualizing the 3-D flow field as a series of color-texture mapped 2-D slices or as a combination of volume rendering for display of the anatomy and scintillation rendering for the display of the motion field. We have studied the performance of the algorithm on four-dimensional volume sequences of synthetic motion, simulated motion of a static object imaged by MR, an MR-imaged rotating object and MR-imaged motion in the human orbit during gaze. The accuracy of the analysis is sufficient to characterize motion in the orbit and scintillation rendering is an effective visualization technique for 3-D motion in the orbit.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.1000254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000254","","Visualization;Biological tissues;Rendering (computer graphics);Extraterrestrial measurements;Motion measurement;Anatomy;Image motion analysis;Motion analysis;Two dimensional displays;Kinematics","eye;biomechanics;kinematics;biomedical MRI;medical image processing;motion estimation;image texture;image sequences;rendering (computer graphics)","cinematic MRI;medical diagnostic imaging;scintillation rendering;motion field display;four-dimensional volume sequences;synthetic motion;static object;T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging volume sequences;multimodality visualization;optical flow;human orbit","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Connective Tissue;Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological;Elasticity;Eye Movements;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine;Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine;Models, Statistical;Movement;Orbit;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","50","","36","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We draw up a list of five requirements for the software to be successfully applied in education. A descriptive graphical interface, a batch interpreter and a pop-up window for showing additional information are more general demands. Specific to our project is a simulator for computations of the electromagnetic field of a source. Furthermore a database containing a selection of EEG measurements, e.g. of evoked responses is desired. We base our project on an existing advanced source analysis (ASA) software package, which closely meets our requirements. The ASA program which is intended for functional source localization based on EEG, incorporates a graphical interface for the EEG measurement set-up, a batch interpreter and a simulator. For our project we design a user-friendly interface for simulations, add a generator for illustrative message windows and generate a database.

The purpose of this comparison is to address the area of application in which each approach could better perform. Methods: Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm (ISRA)-based [Richardson-Lucy (RL), damped-RL] and sparse L2L0 algorithms were implemented and evaluated on both simulated data and in vivo datasets. Simulations were performed at different crossing angles (30°-90°), b-values (1000-3000 s/mm2), SNR (10-30), number of fibers (1-3). Isotropic compartments and different fiber volume fractions were included to obtain more realistic configurations. In vivo datasets were acquired to confirm simulated results. Results: A decrease of SNR or b-value reduces the performances of both approaches. L2L0 methods have better performances at low crossing angles (30°-45°) whereas ISRA methods slightly prevail at high crossing angles (>70°). In the medium crossing angle range, the performance depends on the b-value. In the case of single and 3 fibers configurations as well as in complex scenarios (isotropic components, different partial volumes), ISRA algorithms were able to resolve fiber crossing more accurately and they outperform sparse L2L0 methods. In vivo results confirmed simulated trends. Conclusion: Both classes of algorithms can effectively resolve fiber crossing. L2L0 methods are more effective at low crossing angles whereas ISRA approaches have better performances at high angles and are more robust in more realistic configurations. Significance: This work provides useful indications to select the best performing SD algorithm depending on the specific application.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2676980","Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, Direzione Generale per la Promozione del Sistema Paese (MAECI-DGSP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872460","Crossing fibers;HARDI;ISRA algorithms;sparse approaches;spherical deconvolution","Damping;Deconvolution;Signal to noise ratio;Magnetic resonance imaging;In vivo;Robustness;Brain modeling","biomedical MRI;deconvolution;image reconstruction;medical image processing","spherical deconvolution;complex fiber configurations;diffusion MRI;sparse methods;crossing fiber;in vivo datasets;isotropic compartments;high crossing angles;b-value;different partial volumes;sparse L2L0 methods","Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Nerve Fibers;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","34","Traditional","6 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, a large number of input energy windows are required within the network structure while the commercial cameras have only 3-8 energy windows. It is difficult to use two input windows within the ANN structure for the crosstalk contamination corrections of /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I images acquired using only two photopeak energy windows. In this paper, we designed an ANN network with 24 inputs, 32 nodes in the hidden layer and two nodes in the output layer, to correct for crosstalk contamination in /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I images acquired using two photopeak windows. We trained the network using experimentally acquired /sup 99m/Tc and /sup 123/I spectrum data using the RSD brain phantom. The neural network package Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNSv4.2), from the University of Stuttgart, was used for the neural network training and the crosstalk corrections. Two sets of image data were tested. The first was a human activation study and the other used a cylindrical striatal phantom. Our results show a great improvement on both the human activation and the cylindrical striatal phantom images.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers a multitude of contrasts that offer improved guidance to interventionalists. As such simultaneous real-time acquisition and overlay would be highly favorable for image-guided interventions, e.g., in stroke therapy. One major obstacle in this setting is the fundamentally different acquisition geometry. MRI k-space sampling is associated with parallel projection geometry, while the X-ray acquisition results in perspective distorted projections. The classical rebinning methods to overcome this limitation inherently suffers from a loss of resolution. To counter this problem, we present a novel rebinning algorithm for parallel to cone-beam conversion. We derive a rebinning formula that is then used to find an appropriate deep neural network architecture. Following the known operator learning paradigm, the novel algorithm is mapped to a neural network with differentiable projection operators enabling data-driven learning of the remaining unknown operators. The evaluation aims in two directions: First, we give a profound analysis of the different hypotheses to the unknown operator and investigate the influence of numerical training data. Second, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method against the classical rebinning approach. We demonstrate that the derived network achieves better results than the baseline method and that such operators can be trained with simulated data without losing their generality making them applicable to real data without the need for retraining or transfer learning.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.2998179","Project P3-Stroke; EIT Health Innovation Project; EIT Health through EIT; Body of the European Union; Emerging Fields Initiative (EFI) of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103110","Known operator learning;inverse problems;multi-modal imaging;X-ray;MRI","Detectors;Magnetic resonance imaging;Geometry;X-ray imaging;Tomography;Image reconstruction","biomedical MRI;diagnostic radiography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","magnetic resonance imaging;stroke therapy;k-space sampling;parallel projection geometry;X-ray acquisition;classical rebinning methods;cone-beam conversion;deep neural network;data-driven learning;constrained projection geometry conversion;operator learning;hybrid MR-X-ray imaging","","","","31","IEEE","28 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This compression is irreversible, and therefore allows the possibility that information relevant for performing a diagnostic task is irretrievably lost. The purpose of this study was to evaluate information transfer in beamforming using a previously developed ideal observer model to quantify diagnostic information relevant to performing a task. We describe an elaborated statistical model of image formation for fixed-focus transmission and single-channel reception within a moving aperture, and we use this model on a panel of tasks related to breast sonography to evaluate receive-beamforming approaches that optimize the transfer of information. Under the assumption that acquisition noise is well described as an additive wide-band Gaussian white-noise process, we show that signal compression across receive-aperture channels after a 2-D matched-filtering operation results in no loss of diagnostic information. Across tasks, the matched-filter beamformer results in more information than standard delay-and-sum beamforming in the subsequent radio-frequency signal by a factor of two. We also show that for this matched filter, 68% of the information gain can be attributed to the phase of the matched-filter and 21% can be attributed to the amplitude. A 1-D matched filtering along axial lines shows no advantage over delay-andsum, suggesting an important role for incorporating correlations across different aperture windows in beamforming. We also show that a post-compression processing before the computation of an envelope is necessary to pass the diagnostic information in the beamformed radio-frequency signal to the final envelope image.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5529466","","Array signal processing;Ultrasonic imaging;Apertures;Additive noise;Signal processing;Delay;Radio frequency;Matched filters;Pulse compression methods;Performance evaluation","acoustic pulses;acoustic signal processing;array signal processing;AWGN;biomedical ultrasonics;echo;matched filters;ultrasonic focusing;ultrasonic imaging","optimal ultrasound beamforming;ideal observer;pulse-echo data;signal compression;information transfer;diagnostic information;statistical model;image formation;fixed-focus transmission;single-channel reception;breast sonography;acquisition noise;additive wide-band Gaussian white-noise process;2D matched-filtering operation;radio-frequency signal;information gain;envelope image","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Models, Statistical;Monte Carlo Method;Normal Distribution;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography, Mammary","12","","19","","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes rotation-invariant dictionaries, enabling a concise dictionary (few atoms representing key diffusion-signal types) by explicitly optimizing the rotation for each atom during sparse fitting. The proposed framework generalizes undersampling strategies to both k-space and gradient directions, thereby enabling a balanced undersampling of k-space over all directions.

Thus, the objectives of this paper were to test the hypothesis that knee joint kinematics vary based on gender and to explore the correlation between the 3-D kinematics of the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints. In order to accomplish these goals, a large (n = 34) normative database of combined six degree of freedom patellofemoral and tibiofemoral kinematics, acquired noninvasively during volitional knee extension-flexion using fast-PC (dynamic) magnetic resonance imaging, was established. In this normative database, few correlations between tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics were found. Specifically, tibial external rotation did not predict lateral patellar tilt, as has been stated in previous studies. In general, significant differences could not be found based on gender.

Meanwhile, 3D sonoelastography is based on simple inversion approaches to the viscoelasticity problem. The system presented here is based on the resolution of a full 3D inverse problem, from the complete ultrasound-based measurement of the three components of the 3D displacement field. The 3D information considerably improves the accuracy and reliability of the quantitative measurements and circumvents the operator-dependent aspects of 2D echography diagnosis. The combination of 3D echography and elastography could be a very promising tool for in vivo breast cancer diagnosis. The X-ray system of a commercial mammographic bed was replaced by an ultrasound device. Shear waves were generated using a low frequency vibrator. Resulting displacements in tissues were imaged using an echographic probe moving stepwise around the breast. Advanced techniques such as compounding echographic probe sub-apertures and 2D vector Doppler algorithms were used to assess the three components of the displacement. Shear elasticity, viscosity and anisotropy were quantified using a 3D elastic properties reconstruction algorithm. A 3D finite difference simulation algorithm based on the viscoelastic propagation equation was used to model the 3D forward problem, and validate the inverse reconstruction algorithm. Simulated displacements in a numerical phantom were used as inputs for the inverse problem resolution, allowing the reconstruction of elastic properties similar to that of the numerical phantom. Similarly to MR-elastography, the inverse problem was solved in the Fourier domain. However, overcoming the data acquisition limitations of MR-elastography, the ultrasound-based approach enables the implementation of frequency compound methods based on averaging the data at different shear frequencies, increasing the measurement accuracy. In the present study, the experimental setup was optimized using numerical simulations and validated in vitro. In vitro experiments were conducted on a calibrated phantom exhibiting harder inclusions. Its 3D elastic properties were reconstructed and found consistent with that given by the manufacturer. This study allowed the numerical and experimental validation of the complete 3D elastography protocol.","1051-0117","978-1-4244-1383-6","10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4409747","","Viscosity;Elasticity;Ultrasonic imaging;Breast cancer;Inverse problems;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Frequency;Imaging phantoms;Probes;Reconstruction algorithms","biological tissues;biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;gynaecology;inverse problems;numerical analysis;phantoms;viscoelasticity","full 3D inversion;viscoelasticity wave propagation problem;3D ultrasound elastography;breast cancer diagnosis;inverse problem;3D displacement field;tissues;Doppler algorithms;shear elasticity;viscosity;anisotropy;3D finite difference simulation algorithm;viscoelastic propagation equation;inverse reconstruction algorithm;numerical phantom;Fourier domain","","4","1","4","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of SE in differentiating malignant breast lesions from benign ones has been broadly investigated. The strain ratio (SR) between the background and the breast tumor has been used and its results have been mixed. Due to the complex nature of tissue elasticity and how it relates to the strain fields measured in SE, the exact reason is not known. In this study, we apply a novel design-of-experiments-based metamodeling approach to mechanical simulation of SE in the human breast. To our knowledge, such a study has not been reported in the ultrasound SE literature. More specifically, we first conduct a screening study to identify the biomechanical factors/simulation inputs that most strongly determine SR. We then apply a response surface experimental design to these factors to produce a metamodel of SR as a function of said factors. Results from the screening study suggest that the SR measurements are primarily influenced by three factors: the initial shear modulus of the lesion, the elastic nonlinearity of the lesion, and the precompression applied during acquisition. In order to investigate the implications of these results, stochastic inputs for these three factors associated with the malignant and benign cases were applied to the resulting response surface. The resulting optimal cutoffs, sensitivity, and specificity were generally in line with a majority (>60%) of 19 clinical trials in the literature.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2942821","National Institutes of Health; Michigan Technological University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846716","Factorial design;mathematical modeling;strain elastography (SE);strain ratio (SR);ultrasound","Strain;Lesions;Ultrasonic imaging;Breast;Iron;Computational modeling;Strain measurement","biological organs;biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;design of experiments;elasticity;gynaecology;medical image processing;shear modulus;statistical analysis;tumours","strain ratio measurements;ultrasound breast strain elastography;localized tissue strains;malignant breast lesions;breast tumor;tissue elasticity;strain fields;mechanical simulation;human breast;ultrasound SE literature;SR measurements;malignant cases;benign cases;novel design-of-experiments-based metamodeling approach;elastic nonlinearity","Breast;Breast Neoplasms;Computer Simulation;Elastic Modulus;Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Female;Humans;Sensitivity and Specificity;Ultrasonography, Mammary","","","66","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GIS domain received a great deal of attention from the scientific and industrial applications communities. Many algorithms, protocols, and applications have been built through the ears for the collection, investigation, analysis, and synthesis of data obtained from sensors ranging from temperature, pressure, etc. to satellite imaging. Almost all attempts have been made to deal with data obtained from lumped repositories. Little or almost none works are reported about a general and flexible mechanism used to display geo-dependent data as it is generated. In this paper we present a GIS platform whose goal is to efficiently mine, fuse, and exploit environmental data and to synthetically display the results at the pace the data is produces. A virtual data warehouse to use GIS information is proposed to manage and collect data acquired by and from several sources. The proposed platform allows users to access to environmental data collected by different sources, to register, normalize and visualize data for exploring and analyzing complex structure and relationship, to process data using distributed computing resources and web applications.

Decomposing a 3D shape represented in point cloud into meaningful parts has very important practical implications in the fields of computer graphics, virtual reality and mixed reality. In this paper, a semantic-driven automated hybrid segmentation method is proposed for 3D point cloud shapes. Our method consists of three stages: semantic clustering, variational merging, and region remerging. In the first stage, a new feature of point cloud, called Local Concave-Convex Histogram, is introduced to first extract saddle regions complying with the semantic boundary feature. All other types of regions are then aggregated according to this extracted feature. This stage often leads to multiple over-segmentation convex regions, which are then remerged by a variational method established based on the narrow-band theory. Finally, in order to recombine the regions with the approximate shapes, order relation is introduced to improve the weighting forms in calculating the conventional Shape Diameter Function. We have conducted extensive experiments with the Princeton Dataset. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in this area. We have also applied the proposed algorithm to process the point cloud data acquired directly from the real 3D objects. It achieves excellent results too. These results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper is effective and universal.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976847","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016225","Semantic-driven;local concave-convex histogram;variational method;shape diameter function","Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Clustering algorithms;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Semantics;Surface reconstruction","computer graphics;feature extraction;image segmentation;solid modelling;virtual reality","semantic-driven hybrid segmentation method;3D shapes;3D capturing devices;dense point cloud;fine point cloud;semantic-driven automated hybrid segmentation method;over-segmentation convex regions;point cloud data","","3","","58","CCBY","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerous factors, however, make instilling teamwork skills into deep-space astronauts extremely challenging. First, due to communication difficulties and mission duration, teams must be trained in a wide variety of domains - from maintenance procedures throughout the ship, to extremely thorough medical training, to science evaluations. Second, there may be a significant delay between when such knowledge is acquired and when it is needed; for instance, several years may pass between an astronaut learning how to diagnose, and to treat, a collapsed lung. Third, training must anticipate a huge range of conditions; the sheer length of deep-space missions when compared to shuttle missions vastly increases the number, and scope, of possible situations that could arise, making it virtually impossible to train for every scenario. To face the myriad challenges of deep-space flight, inflight training must be readily available. Our solution is a low-fidelity simulation using game-based training that leverages our experience with intelligent tutoring system (ITS) technology. Game-based training is engaging - it provides an entertaining break from the more onerous aspects of deep-space flight. Moreover, it incentivizes practice of amorphous, but critical, teamwork skills, motivating crews to practice more frequently for either mission-related team training or generalizable team skills training. Finally, a game-based solution addresses the problem of finding the physical space in which to train when a small crew is constrained in a cramped environment for extended periods of time. This paper reviews the process of creating games based on firefighting on the International Space Station (ISS) and Medical Training. We review the process of analyzing the firefighting procedure to determine the teamwork skills involved; how those skills were mapped to game mechanics; what changes were made to try to make the experience more engaging; and finally, whether these changes were effective.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500503","","Training;Games;Measurement;Teamwork;Fires;Space missions;Engines","aerospace computing;aerospace simulation;biomedical education;computer based training;intelligent tutoring systems;medical computing;serious games (computing)","serious games;knowledge retention;long-duration space missions;NASA Johnson Space Center;deep-space astronauts;maintenance procedures;ship;medical training;science evaluations;astronaut learning;deep-space missions;sheer length;low-fidelity simulation;game-based training;intelligent tutoring system;ITS technology;deep-space flight;mission-related team training;generalizable team skills training;International Space Station;ISS;firefighting procedure;teamwork skills","","3","","9","","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multipinhole SPECT adds information due to its improved sampling, and can improve the trade-off between resolution and sensitivity. To evaluate different pinhole collimator designs an efficient method is needed that quantifies the reconstruction image quality. In this paper, we propose a fast, approximate method that examines the quality of individual voxels of a postsmoothed maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction by studying their linearized local impulse response (LLIR) and (co)variance for a predefined target resolution. For validation, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) in some voxels of a homogeneous sphere and of a realistic rat brain software phantom were calculated for many single and multipinhole designs. A good agreement was observed between the CNRs obtained with the approximate method and those obtained with postsmoothed MLEM reconstructions of simulated noisy projections. This good agreement was quantified by a least squares fit through these results, which yielded a line with slope 1.02 (1.00 expected) and a y-intercept close to zero (0 expected). 95.4% of the validation points lie within three standard deviations from that line. Using the approximate method, the influence on the CNR of varying a parameter in realistic single and multipinhole designs was examined. The investigated parameters were the aperture diameter, the distance between the apertures and the axis-of-rotation, the focal distance, the acceptance angle, the position of the apertures, the focusing distance, and the number of pinholes. The results can generally be explained by the change in sensitivity, the amount of postsmoothing, and the amount of overlap in the projections. The method was applied to multipinhole designs with apertures focusing at a single point, but is also applicable to other designs.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2007.902802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359035","Collimator;image reconstruction;multipinhole SPECT;variance approximation;Collimator;image reconstruction;multipinhole SPECT;variance approximation","Collimators;Design methodology;Animals;Apertures;Image reconstruction;Least squares approximation;Focusing;High-resolution imaging;Image sampling;Image quality","brain;collimators;expectation-maximisation algorithm;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sampling;least squares approximations;medical image processing;neurophysiology;phantoms;single photon emission computed tomography","multipinhole collimator design;singlepinhole collimator design;small animal SPECT;high-resolution functional imaging;circular orbit acquisition;image reconstruction;image quality;maximum likelihood expectation maximization;MLEM;linearized local impulse response;contrast-to-noise ratio;brain software phantom;least squares fit;postsmoothing;variance approximation","Algorithms;Animals;Computer Simulation;Computer-Aided Design;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Theoretical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon","47","","27","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ayache","Epidaure Project, INRIA, Sophia Antipolis, France; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","7 Aug 2002","2002","21","2","122","138","We present a new method to automatically compute, reorient, and recenter the mid-sagittal plane in anatomical and functional three-dimensional (3-D) brain images. This iterative approach is composed of two steps. At first, given an initial guess of the mid-sagittal plane (generally, the central plane of the image grid), the computation of local similarity measures between the two sides of the head allows to identify homologous anatomical structures or functional areas, by way of a block matching procedure. The output is a set of point-to-point correspondences: the centers of homologous blocks. Subsequently, we define the mid-sagittal plane as the one best superposing the points on one side and their counterparts on the other side by reflective symmetry. Practically, the computation of the parameters characterizing the plane is performed by a least trimmed squares estimation. Then, the estimated plane is aligned with the center of the image grid, and the whole process is iterated until convergence. The robust estimation technique we use allows normal or abnormal asymmetrical structures or areas to be treated as outliers, and the plane to be mainly computed from the underlying gross symmetry of the brain. The algorithm is fast and accurate, even for strongly tilted heads, and even in presence of high acquisition noise and bias field, as shown on a large set of synthetic data. The algorithm has also been visually evaluated on a large set of real magnetic resonance (MR) images. We present a few results on isotropic as well as anisotropic anatomical (MR and computed tomography) and functional (single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography) real images, for normal and pathological subjects.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.993131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993131","","Brain;Magnetic heads;Iterative methods;Grid computing;Area measurement;Anatomical structure;Convergence;Robustness;Magnetic noise;Magnetic resonance","iterative methods;single photon emission computed tomography;biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;brain;medical image processing;positron emission tomography","PET;SPECT;CT;medical diagnostic imaging;high acquisition noise;bias field;strongly tilted heads;synthetic data;anisotropic anatomical images;pathological subjects;normal subjects;least trimmed squares estimation;isotropic images;magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear medicine","Algorithms;Anisotropy;Brain;Brain;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes","107","5","43","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An algorithm called morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI), which incorporates spatial prior information, has been proposed to generate a quantitative susceptibility map (QSM). The accuracy of QSM can be validated experimentally. However, there is not yet a rigorous mathematical demonstration of accuracy for a general regularized approach or for MEDI specifically. The error in the susceptibility map reconstructed by MEDI is expressed in terms of the acquisition noise and the error in the spatial prior information. A detailed analysis demonstrates that the error in the susceptibility map reconstructed by MEDI is bounded by a linear function of these two error sources. Numerical analysis confirms that the error of the susceptibility map reconstructed by MEDI is on the same order of the noise in the original MRI data, and comprehensive edge detection will lead to reduced model error in MEDI. Additional phantom validation and human brain imaging demonstrated the practicality of the MEDI method.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2182523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122509","Error analysis;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);morphology enabled dipoleinversion (MEDI);quantitative susceptibility mapping","Image reconstruction;Noise;Image edge detection;Inverse problems;Phantoms;Magnetic susceptibility","biomedical MRI;brain;convolution;edge detection;error analysis;image reconstruction;inverse problems;medical image processing;noise;phantoms","morphology enabled dipole inversion algorithm;quantitative susceptibility mapping;MRI;magnetic resonance scanner;ill-posed inverse problem;convolution kernel;forward problem;spatial prior information;quantitative susceptibility map;general regularized approach;susceptibility map reconstruction;acquisition noise;error;numerical analysis;edge detection;phantom;human brain imaging","Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuroimaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results","69","","27","","4 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are several analytical and numerical methods reported to analyze this problem [Deshpande, M.D., et al., 1982], [Pozar, D.M., 1982], which are quite time consuming when good accuracy is required. Here in this paper, a qualitative model which is very fast and accurate based on fuzzy inference is presented [Tayarani, M., et al., 2001], [Tayarani, M., et al.], and [Tayarani, M., et al., 1999]. General structure of the model is reviewed at first based on input impedance of a single patch. Then we explain the key definitions and the method we used to extract the parameters of the model. At first some measured or simulated data is required to extract its knowledge. Here we used both measured and HFSS simulated data. Variation of centers and radii, for partial loci, and biases and slopes, for partial phase lines, as input parameters of the fuzzy model, could be fitted by very simple curves. Then input impedance of microstrip patch antenna for any feed position can be predicted very easily by applying the initial values calculated from the above simple curves to proposed fuzzy system.

The proposed scheme relies on the manifold structure of local image patches at the same spatial location in a free-breathing cardiac MRI dataset; this approach is a generalization of the SmooThness Regularization on Manifolds (SToRM) scheme that exploits the global manifold structure of images in the dataset. Since the manifold structure of the patches varies depending on the spatial location and is often considerably simpler than the global one, this approach significantly reduces the data demand, facilitating the recovery from shorter scans. Since the navigator-based estimation of manifold structure pursued in SToRM is not feasible in this setting, a reformulation of SToRM is introduced. Specifically, the regularization term of the cost function involves the sum of robust distances between images sub-patches in the dataset. The optimization algorithm alternates between updating the images and estimating the manifold structure of the image patches. The utility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in the context of in-vivo prospective free-breathing cardiac CINE MRI imaging with multichannel acquisitions and simulated phantoms.

The FS-RGLSVR is composed of Takagi-Sugeno (TS)-type fuzzy if-then rules. These rules are automatically constructed by a self-splitting rule generation algorithm that introduces the self-splitting technique to the k-means clustering algorithm. This new algorithm regards a cluster as a fuzzy rule, where no preassignment of the cluster (rule) number is necessary. The cost function for parameter learning is defined based on structural risk instead of empirical risk minimization in order to achieve generalizability. Tuning all of the free parameters in the FS-RGLSVR using linear support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to minimize the cost function. Each of the consequent and antecedent part parameters is expressed as a linear combination coefficient in a transformed input space so that the linear SVR is applicable. This paper introduces iterative linear SVR to tune antecedent and consequent parameters. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of FS-RGLSVR by two simulated and four practical regression examples.

However, statistical analysis suggests that the noise variance could be better modeled by a nonlinear function of the image intensity depending on external parameters related to the image acquisition protocol.

Since current MREPT methods rely on an assumption of a locally homogeneous admittivity, there occurs a reconstruction error where this assumption fails. Rigorously analyzing the reconstruction error in MREPT, we showed that the error is fundamental and may cause technical difficulties in interpreting MREPT images of a general inhomogeneous object. We performed numerical simulations and phantom experiments to quantitatively support the error analysis. We compared the MREPT image reconstruction problem with that of magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) to highlight distinct features of both methods to probe the same object in terms of its high- and low-frequency conductivity distributions, respectively. MREPT images showed large errors along boundaries where admittivity values changed whereas MREIT images showed no such boundary effects.

As the first element in the chain, its robustness is critical for the overall performance of the system. Many skull stripping methods have been proposed, but the problem is not considered to be completely solved yet. Many systems in the literature have good performance on certain datasets (mostly the datasets they were trained/tuned on), but fail to produce satisfactory results when the acquisition conditions or study populations are different. In this paper we introduce a robust, learning-based brain extraction system (ROBEX). The method combines a discriminative and a generative model to achieve the final result. The discriminative model is a Random Forest classifier trained to detect the brain boundary; the generative model is a point distribution model that ensures that the result is plausible. When a new image is presented to the system, the generative model is explored to find the contour with highest likelihood according to the discriminative model. Because the target shape is in general not perfectly represented by the generative model, the contour is refined using graph cuts to obtain the final segmentation. Both models were trained using 92 scans from a proprietary dataset but they achieve a high degree of robustness on a variety of other datasets. ROBEX was compared with six other popular, publicly available methods (BET, BSE, FreeSurfer, AFNI, BridgeBurner, and GCUT) on three publicly available datasets (IBSR, LPBA40, and OASIS, 137 scans in total) that include a wide range of acquisition hardware and a highly variable population (different age groups, healthy/diseased). The results show that ROBEX provides significantly improved performance measures for almost every method/dataset combination.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2138152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5742706","Comparison;minimum s-t cut;point distribution models;random forests;skull stripping","Brain modeling;Training;Vegetation;Skull;Magnetic resonance imaging;Accuracy;Shape","biomedical MRI;brain;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);random processes","robust brain extraction;automatic whole brain extraction;magnetic resonance images;skull stripping;neuroimage pipelines;robust learning based brain extraction system;discriminative model;generative model;random forest classifier;point distribution model;graph cuts;ROBEX","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Automatic Data Processing;Brain;Brain;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Discriminant Analysis;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Anatomic;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Skull","278","1","49","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed algorithm is based on solving a least squares problem to estimate the coefficients of a second order polynomial expansion to fit the magnitude of the two dimensional complex normalized correlation of the generalized analytic signal in the vicinity of the true peak. The generalization method utilizes the Riesz transform which is the multidimensional Hilbert transform. The displacement is estimated from acquired successive radio-frequency data frames of the region of interest. Field II simulation of flow data in a channel with a bench mark known displacement is generated to validate the accuracy of the method.

The temperature information can be employed to adjust the position and the power of the HIFU system in real time and to determine the therapy endpoint. The requirement to resolve both physiological motion of mobile organs and the rapid temperature variations induced by state-of-the-art high-power HIFU systems require fast MRI-acquisition schemes, which are generally hampered by low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This directly limits the precision of real time MR-thermometry and thus in many cases the feasibility of sophisticated control algorithms. To overcome these limitations, temporal filtering of the temperature has been suggested in the past, which has generally an adverse impact on the accuracy and latency of the filtered data. Here, we propose a novel filter that aims to improve the precision of MR-thermometry while monitoring and adapting its impact on the accuracy. For this, an adaptive extended Kalman filter using a model describing the heat transfer for acoustic heating in biological tissues was employed together with an additional outlier rejection to address the problem of sparse artifacted temperature points. The filter was compared to an efficient matched FIR filter and outperformed the latter in all tested cases. The filter was first evaluated on simulated data and provided in the worst case (with an approximate configuration of the model) a substantial improvement of the accuracy by a factor 3 and 15 during heat up and cool down periods, respectively. The robustness of the filter was then evaluated during HIFU experiments on a phantom and in vivo in porcine kidney. The presence of strong temperature artifacts did not affect the thermal dose measurement using our filter whereas a high measurement variation of 70% was observed with the FIR filter.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2171772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6044717","Biomedical signal processing;Kalman filters;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);real time systems","Temperature measurement;Heating;Accuracy;Absorption;Predictive models;Kalman filters;Noise","biomedical MRI;biomedical ultrasonics;Kalman filters;kidney;radiation therapy;tumours","adaptive extended Kalman filtering;real time HIFU intervention;MR thermometry guided HIFU intervention;magnetic resonance thermometry;high intensity focused ultrasound;tumorous tissue;temperature information;physiological motion;mobile organs;temporal filtering;heat transfer;acoustic heating;porcine kidney;thermal dose measurement","Algorithms;Animals;Computer Simulation;High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation;Hot Temperature;Kidney;Kidney;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Swine","26","","18","","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multi-frame techniques, such as microscanning, are an effective means of reducing aliasing and increasing resolution in images produced by staring imaging systems. These techniques involve interlacing a set of image frames that have been shifted with respect to each other during acquisition. The FLIR system is mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft, and the vibrations associated with the platform are used to generate the shifts. Since a fixed number of image frames is required, and the shifts are random, the acquired frames will not fall on a uniformly spaced grid. Furthermore, some of the acquired frames may have almost similar shifts thus making them unusable for high-resolution image reconstruction. In this paper, we utilize a gradient-based registration algorithm to estimate the shifts between the acquired frames and then use a weighted nearest-neighbor approach for placing the frames onto a uniform grid to form a final high-resolution image. Blurring by the detector and optics of the imaging system limits the increase in image resolution when microscanning is attempted at sub-pixel movements of less than half the detector width.

Since the operation of heavy machines requires continued vigilance and mental activity, fatigue caused by long hours of work and constant effort generally occurs in this environment. In general, mental fatigue is related to a loss of efficiency, leading to a decrease in productivity and inducing critical errors, which can provoke equipment breakups or accidents with human victims. At this high cognitive workload environment, there is a need for the development of robust monitoring techniques aiming to predict mental fatigue before workers' movement responses become slower, more variable, and more error-prone. In this work, we introduce a residual multilayer perceptron (MLP) network (ResMLPNet) and assess its performance in the challenging problem of mental fatigue classification from cognitive electrophysiology data, acquired during Virtual Reality (VR) training sessions mimicking a real operation faced by excavator workers at the mining industry. In a three-step training strategy, the ResMLPNet achieved slightly better classification accuracies compared to its plain MLP architecture.","2643-6264","978-1-7281-4253-1","10.1109/BRACIS.2019.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8923986","Residual multilayer perceptron network;Classification;mental fatigue;EEG time series","Fatigue;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Training;Task analysis;Databases;Benchmark testing","brain;cognition;electroencephalography;ergonomics;fatigue;medical signal processing;mining industry;multilayer perceptrons;neurophysiology;occupational stress;pattern classification;virtual reality","mining workers;brain data;mining industry;human safety;logistics pipeline;mental activity;human victims;residual multilayer perceptron network;mental fatigue classification;cognitive electrophysiology data;residual MLP network","","","","15","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is assumed that the number of counts in each pixel of the image represents the number of back-to-back 511 keV photon pairs being emitted at that location in the brain. The program then follows the history of each photons' interactions in the scattering medium and generates the sinograms for the scattered and unscattered photon pairs detected in a simulated 3D PET acquisition. The calculated scatter contribution is then subtracted from the original data set. The calculation is general and can be applied to any scanner configuration or geometry. In its current form the simulation requires 25 hours on a single Sparc10 CPU when every pixel in a 15-plane, 128/spl times/128 pixel image volume is studied, and less than 2 hours when sampled over regions of 4/spl times/4 pixels.

Consequently, speckle decorrelation due to out of plane motion by the transducer may lead to significantly reduced image motion estimation accuracy and/or reliability.

A major problem in map building is due to the imprecision of sensor measures. In this paper, we propose a technique, called elastic correction, for correcting the dead-reckoning errors made during the exploration of an environment by a robot capable of identifying landmarks. Knowledge being acquired is modeled by a relational graph whose vertices and arcs represent, respectively, landmarks and routes. Elastic correction is based on an analogy between the graph modeling the environment and a mechanical structure: the map is regarded as a truss where each route is an elastic bar and each landmark a node. Errors are corrected as a result of the deformations induced from the forces arising within the structure as inconsistent measures are taken. The elasticity parameters characterizing the structure are used to model the uncertainty on odometry. The paper presents results from simulations showing the effectiveness of the method for reducing the overall metric error and proving its robustness with reference to topological errors and to unpredictable sensor errors.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.917081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917081","","Error correction;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Orbital robotics;Wheels;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Intelligent robots;Force measurement;Elasticity;Robustness","mobile robots;error correction;navigation;pattern recognition;knowledge acquisition;graph theory","dead-reckoning error correction;map building;mobile robots;fully autonomous behavior;sensor measure imprecision;elastic correction;dead-reckoning errors;landmark identification;relational graph;routes;environment modelling;mechanical structure analogy;odometry uncertainty;metric error reduction;topological errors;unpredictable sensor errors","","38","","24","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These methods depend on accurate registration of PET/SPECT and MRI/CT images. Herein, we consider registration via optimization of a PET/SPECT image-reconstruction objective function which includes the registration parameters. Potential benefits of this approach include 1) modeling, within the registration process, of PET/SPECT noise and PET/SPECT acquisition effects such as limited spatial resolution, perhaps resulting in more accurate registration and 2) a natural framework for calculating joint uncertainties in registration parameters and radiotracer activity. In cases where the structures imaged by MRI/CT (e.g., gray matter and white matter in the brain) strongly influence the radiotracer distribution, the relatively small number of variables comprised of alignment parameters and regional radiotracer mean activities may account for, not all, but much of the estimable radiotracer distribution, and it may be useful to develop methods for rapid, highly accurate estimation of these few parameters, ultimately embedding such estimation within more general estimation of the full radiotracer distribution. Herein we develop Levenberg-Marquardt simultaneous estimation of regional radiotracer mean activities and the six 3D rigid body translation and rotation alignment parameters. The method is tested by a computer-simulation study. With a PET/SPECT scanner spatial resolution of 0.2 cm FWHM, this study shows translational registration errors of about 0.002 cm and rotational errors which are fractions of a degree. For small regions, estimates of regional mean activities are much closer to true values than are estimates obtained by OSEM using PET/SPECT projection data only.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2006.875467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645022","CT;image reconstruction;MRI;PET;registration;SPECT","Magnetic resonance imaging;Image reconstruction;Positron emission tomography;Computed tomography;Spatial resolution;Computer errors;Radiology;Biomedical imaging;X-ray imaging;Uncertainty","positron emission tomography;image reconstruction;single photon emission computed tomography;biomedical MRI;radioactive tracers","emission-tomography image reconstruction objective function;PET radiotracer images;SPECT radiotracer images;registered MRI images;registered CT images;PET image-reconstruction objective function;SPECT image-reconstruction objective function;PET noise modeling;SPECT noise modeling;PET acquisition effects;SPECT acquisition effects;uncertainties calculation;radiotracer distribution;regional radiotracer mean activities;Levenberg-Marquardt simultaneous estimation;3D rigid body translation alignment parameters;3D rigid body rotation alignment parameters;computer-simulation study;PET scanner spatial resolution;SPECT scanner spatial resolution;FWHM;translational registration errors;rotational errors;OSEM;PET projection data;SPECT projection data","","5","","35","","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Insonifying a medium with plane waves is a particularly interesting approach in 3-D imaging with matrix arrays because it allows to tremendously reduce the volume of data to be stored and processed as well as the acquisition time. However, even if the data volume is reduced with plane wave emissions, the image reconstruction in the time domain with a delay-and-sum algorithm is not sufficient to achieve low computation times in 3-D due to the number of voxels. Other reconstruction algorithms take place in the wavenumber-frequency (f-k) domain and have been shown to accelerate computation times in seismic imaging and in synthetic aperture radar. In this paper, we start from time-domain PWI in 2-D and compare it to two algorithms in the f-k domain, coming from the Stolt migration in seismic imaging and the Lu theory of limited diffraction beams in medical imaging. We then extend them to immersion testing configurations where a linear array is facing a plane water-steel interface. Finally, the reconstruction algorithms are generalized to 3-D imaging with matrix arrays. A comparison dwelling on image quality and algorithmic complexities is provided, as well as a theoretical analysis of the image amplitudes and the limits of each method. We show that the reconstruction schemes in the f-k domain improve the lateral resolution and offer a theoretical and numerical computation gain of up to 36 in 3-D imaging in a realistic NDT configuration.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2895995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629307","2-D and 3-D imaging;nondestructive testing (NDT);transducer arrays;ultrasounds;wavenumber–frequency (f-k) migration","Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Acoustics;Time-domain analysis;Biomedical imaging;Frequency control","biomedical ultrasonics;image reconstruction;image resolution;medical image processing;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;time-domain analysis;ultrasonic imaging","Fourier domain;nondestructive testing;time-domain plane-wave imaging;medical imaging;steered plane waves;matrix arrays;plane wave emissions;image reconstruction;seismic imaging;time-domain PWI;plane water-steel interface;image quality;image amplitudes;3D imaging","Algorithms;Equipment Design;Fourier Analysis;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Transducers;Ultrasonography","2","","38","","29 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike conventional photoacoustic tomography scanning, where the scanning device rotates around the subject, the scanning aperture in IVPA imaging is enclosed within the imaged object. The display of the intravascular structure is typically obtained by converting detected photoacoustic waves into Cartesian coordinates, which can produce images with severe artifacts. Because the acquired data are highly limited, there does not exist a stable reconstruction algorithm for such imaging geometry. The purpose of this work was to apply image reconstruction concepts to explore the feasibility and efficacy of image reconstruction algorithms in IVPA imaging using traditional analytical formulas, such as a filtered back-projection (FBP) and the lambda-tomography method. Although the closed-form formulas are not exact for the IVPA system, a general picture of and interface information about objects are provided. To improve the quality of the reconstructed image, the iterative expectation maximization and penalized least-squares methods were adopted to minimize the difference between the measured signals and those generated by a reconstructed image. In this work, we considered both the ideal point detector and the acoustic transducers with finite- size aperture. The transducer effects including the spatial response of aperture and acoustoelectrical impulse responses were incorporated in the system matrix to reduce the aroused distortion in the IVPA reconstruction. Computer simulations and experiments were carried out to validate the methods.

A new method that attempts to remove these distortions is proposed in this paper and is based on the use of transceiver-phased arrays. The proposed system uses, in the examples presented herein, a shielded four-element transceive-phased array head coil and involves performing two separate scans of the same slice with each scan using different excitations during transmission. By optimizing the amplitudes and phases for each scan, antipodal signal profiles can be obtained, and by combining both the images together, the image distortion can be reduced several fold. A combined hybrid method of moments (MoM)/finite element method (FEM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique is proposed and used to elucidate the concept of the new method and to accurately evaluate the electromagnetic field (EMF) in a human head model. In addition, the proposed method is used in conjunction with the generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) reconstruction technique to enable rapid imaging of the two scans. Simulation results reported herein for 11-T (470-MHz) brain imaging applications show that the new method with GRAPPA reconstruction theoretically results in improved image quality and that the proposed combined hybrid MoM/FEM and FDTD technique is suitable for high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) numerical analysis","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2006.884539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4014657","Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods;finite element methods (FEMs);magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);moment methods","","biomedical MRI;brain;finite difference time-domain analysis;finite element analysis;image reconstruction;medical image processing;method of moments","high-field magnetic resonance imaging;MoM;FEM;FDTD;image distortions;transceiver-phased arrays;antipodal signal profiles;method of moment;finite element method;finite-difference time-domain technique;electromagnetic field;generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions reconstruction;brain imaging applications;image quality;MRI","","11","","34","","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wall stress analysis is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, however, 3D ultrasound (US) has not been used yet. In this study, the feasibility of 3D US based wall stress analysis is investigated and compared to CT. Three-dimensional US and CT data were acquired in 15 patients (diameter 35 - 90 mm). US data were segmented manually and compared to automatically acquired CT geometries by calculating the similarity index (SI) and Hausdorff distance (HD). Wall stresses were simulated at p = 140 mmHg using a non-linear material model (Raghavan & Vorp). The SI of US vs CT was 0.75 - 0.91, with a median HD of 5 - 15 mm, with the higher values found at the proximal and distal sides of the AAA. Wall stresses were in accordance with literature and a good agreement was found between US and CT-based median stresses and inter-quartile stresses. Stress values of US were typically higher, the result of geometrical irregularities, caused by the manual segmentation of the US data. In future work, an automated segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement.","1051-0117","978-1-4799-7049-0","10.1109/ULTSYM.2014.0573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6932026","abdominal aortic aneurysm;wall stress;3D","Stress;Computed tomography;Three-dimensional displays;Aneurysm;Geometry;Ultrasonic imaging;Biomechanics","biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;computerised tomography;diseases;image segmentation;medical image processing","3D ultrasound;abdominal aortic aneurysms;risk stratification;wall stress analysis;computed tomography;similarity index;Hausdorff distance;nonlinear material model;data segmentation","","","","7","","23 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The BOLD fMRI signal was acquired during a novel 2-D tracking task in which participants (10 males, 10 females) were cued to either briefly stop tracking and close their eyes (Stop+Close) or to briefly stop tracking (Stop) only. The onset and duration of eye-closure and stopping were identified post hoc from eye-video, EOG, and visuomotor response. fMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) and tensorial independent component analysis (TICA). The GLM-based analysis identified predominantly increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity during eye-closure and stopping in multisensory areas, sensory-motor integration areas, and default-mode regions. Stopping during tracking elicited increased activity in visual processing areas, sensory-motor integration areas, and premotor areas. TICA separated the spatio-temporal pattern of activity into multiple task-related networks including the 1) occipito-medial frontal eye-movement network, 2) sensory areas, 3) left-lateralized visuomotor network, and 4) fronto-parietal visuomotor network, which were modulated differently by Stop+Close and Stop. The results demonstrate the merits of using simultaneous fMRI, behavioral, and physiological recordings to investigate the mechanisms underlying complex human behaviors in the human brain. Furthermore, knowledge of widespread modulations in brain activity due to voluntary eye-closure or stopping during a continuous visuomotor task is important for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying involuntary behaviors, such as microsleeps and attention lapses, which are often accompanied by brief eye-closure and/or response failures.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2050782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477176","Attention;eye-closure;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);simultaneous recording;tensorial independent component analysis;visuomotor tracking","Physics;Biomedical engineering;Independent component analysis;Hospitals;Electrooculography;Humans;Brain;Permission;Data analysis;Delay","biomedical MRI;blood;independent component analysis;neurophysiology;vision","BOLD change;cued eye closure;continuous visuomotor task;neural activity;functional magnetic resonance imaging;eye video;EOG;MRI scanner;2D tracking task;general linear model;tensorial independent component analysis;blood oxygenation level dependent;multisensory area;sensory motor integration area","Adult;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Cues;Electrooculography;Eye Movements;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Motion Perception;Movement;Oxygen Consumption;Young Adult","7","","34","","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper deals with a generalization of dense stereo reconstruction, which forms the basis for incremental fusing of stereo sequences to construct a 3-D model of underwater natural objects. The approach is fast and robust. Initialized with a set of robust feature matches over the left and right images, efficient left-to-right and right-to-left stereo matching are carried out by match propagation [Q. Chen, G. Medioni, 1999]. Symmetry relation between the two stereo matchings is utilized to guide robust fusion. Where a large difference exists between the two dense stereo reconstructions, it is most probable that at least one estimate is erroneous, thus is rejected. Conversely, small differences are expected because of the discrete nature of the disparity values. When fused these two estimates, better results are expected. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","","0-7803-9103-9","10.1109/OCEANSE.2005.1511774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511774","","Robustness;Stereo vision;Stereo image processing;Brightness;Image reconstruction;Application software;Computer vision;Cameras;Motion estimation;Layout","stereo image processing;image reconstruction;virtual reality;multimedia systems;seafloor phenomena;geophysics computing","dense stereo reconstruction;symmetry guided fusion;photorealistic 3D computer models;active research area;Virtual Reality and Multimedia systems;incremental fusing;stereo sequences fusing;underwater natural objects;left-to-right stereo matching;right-to-left stereo matching;match propagation","","5","1","45","","3 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A simple geometric model of white-matter tissue provides an expression that relates the axon radius to the diffusion MRI signal. The aim is to determine the accuracy and precision with which we can estimate this potentially important new biomarker. Precision and accuracy depend critically on the acquisition protocol. The paper proposes a general strategy to optimize the experiment design of in-vivo diffusion MRI experiments. The applicability of the design optimization extends well beyond the current work to optimizing the acquisition for any model of the diffusion process. Simulation experiments and results suggest feasibility of measuring larger axon radii in vivo on modern MRI scanners using the optimized acquisition schemes, but that higher gradient strengths are required to measure smaller axons.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4409141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4409141","","Nerve fibers;In vivo;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biomarkers;Design optimization;Particle measurements;Microstructure;Solid modeling;Displacement measurement;Tensile stress","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;diffusion;medical image processing;optimisation","axon radius measurements;axon-cell dimensions;white-matter tissue;diffusion MRI signal;biomarker;acquisition protocol;in-vivo diffusion MRI;design optimization;optimized acquisition schemes;gradient strengths","","5","","38","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

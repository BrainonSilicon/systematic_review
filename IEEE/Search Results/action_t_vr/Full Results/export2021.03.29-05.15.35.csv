"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for String Stable Mixed Traffic: Benchmark and Human-Centered Design","F. Li; Y. Wang","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","7 Dec 2017","2017","18","12","3473","3485","With the emergence of vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) cars can be expected in the near future. In this paper, novel criteria for string stability are proposed for mixed traffic platoons that consist of both automated and manual driving cars. A mixed traffic string stability definition is proposed to guarantee the boundedness of the motion states fluctuation upstream as well as the safety of the entire platoon. With proper arrangements of the platoon sequence as well as mild restrictions on the leading car's velocity overshoot, the proposed mixed traffic string stability can be realized via some suitable controller design for the automated cars. The benchmark controller with feedback and feedforward path is first used to verify the above results with rigorous proof. Furthermore, a human-centered CACC system is designed to improve both physical and psychological comfort of a driver under the guarantee of mixed traffic string stability. The action-point car-following model is adapted to quantify the driver's psychological comfort in combination with the quantification of physical comfort based on jerk. A model predictive control-like blending ratio controller is developed to obtain the optimal time headway in the feedback controller for tradeoffs among driver comfort, fuel efficiency, and traffic throughput under string stability constraints. Finally, a seven-car CACC mixed traffic platoon scenario is simulated. Compared with the benchmark CACC controller design, the human-centered CACC design is shown to largely improve the driving comfort.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2760805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094925","Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC);mixed traffic;string stability;human-centered controller","Stability criteria;Transfer functions;Psychology;Cruise control;Human factors;Vehicular ad hoc networks","adaptive control;automobiles;control system synthesis;cooperative systems;feedback;feedforward;predictive control;road traffic control;road vehicles;stability;velocity control","mixed traffic string stability definition;platoon sequence;automated cars;benchmark controller;human-centered CACC system;action-point car-following model;feedback controller;string stability constraints;human-centered CACC design;string stable mixed traffic;human-centered design;vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology;adaptive cruise control cars;mixed traffic platoons;automated driving cars;controller design;model predictive control;blending ratio controller;cooperative adaptive cruise control","","8","","36","","3 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To do this, they need to quantify the proximity of the security constraints, determine the most critical ones, and then execute a set of actions designed to restore safety margins. A particularly important set of security constraints is thermal overload limits of transformers and transmission lines. However, current thermal security assessment practices typically rely on guessing critical power transfers, require repetitive computer simulations, and are limited to two-dimensional nomograms that are constructed off-line. We present techniques for making this process more efficient and effective that use a linear system model and are based on the analysis of a polyhedron in the space of generator and load powers. These techniques have been tested on three real power networks, one of which has 45k buses.","","978-1-4799-1785-3","10.1109/ISGT.2015.7131823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131823","","Security;Visualization;Generators;Thermal loading;Stochastic processes;Power system stability","linear network analysis;power system security;power system simulation","system operators;power system security;security constraints;safety margins;thermal overload limits;transformers;transmission lines;thermal security assessment;critical power transfers;two-dimensional nomograms;linear system model;load powers;real power networks","","","","9","","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We establish a new input-output property of this linear networked system and moreover its convergent property under an external input, upon which, we establish a unified framework to resolve the consensus problem of multiple mechanical systems. The proposed consensus framework unifies/extends the existing results and in addition yields a fully cascaded closed-loop system.

This allows you to save the computing power of microcontrollers, on which electric drives are made. The purpose of the article is to create a variant of the technical implementation of the high-speed response AC servo drive on the programmable logic. To achieve this goal, a block diagram of the servo drive and transfer functions of all its elements are considered. It is shown that with a certain method of controller's synthesis, such block diagram of electric drive requires a minimum of calculations. A function diagram of the integral controller for the technical implementation on the programmable logic device is developed. The principle of its operation and limiting of the output signal, which ensures the stability of the servo drive in the whole range of movements and speeds, are considered. A function diagram of the set of proportional and proportional-differential controllers and a differentiating element in the speed feedback circuit has also been developed. The sequence of operation of all its elements, the principle of synchronization of the device and the limitations of the output signal of the proportional-differential controller, which is fed to a digital modulator that controls the transistors of the power converter, are considered.

Deep reinforcement learning has been successfully used for dialogue policy optimization for a static pre-defined domain. However, when the domain changes dynamically, e.g. a new previously unseen concept (or slot) which can be then used as a database search constraint is added, or the policy for one domain is transferred to another domain, the dialogue state space and action sets both will change. Therefore, the model structures for different domains have to be different. This makes dialogue policy adaptation/transfer challenging. Here a multi -agent dialogue policy (MADP) is proposed to tackle these problems. MADP consists of some slot-dependent agents (S-Agents) and a slot-independent agent (G-Agent). S-Agents have shared parameters in addition to private parameters for each one. During policy transfer, the shared parameters in S-Agents and the parameters in G-Agent can be directly transferred to the agents in extended/new domain.

The optimization delivers an optimal control sequence and the first control thus obtained is applied to the plant. An important constituent of this type of control is the accuracy of the model. For a system with fractional dynamics, accurate model can be obtained using fractional calculus. One of the methods to implement such a model for control purpose is Oustaloup's recursive approximation. This method delivers equivalent integer-order transfer function for a fractional-order system, which is then utilized as an internal model in model predictive control.

In a previous work we proposed a hierarchical modular reinforcement learning model (RANK) that can learn multiple motor skills in continuous action and state spaces. The model is based on a development of the mixture-of-expert model that has been suitably developed to work with reinforcement learning. In particular, the model uses a high-level gating network for assigning responsibilities for acting and for learning to a set of low-level expert networks. The model was also developed with the goal of exploiting the Piagetian mechanisms of assimilation and accommodation to support learning of multiple tasks. This paper proposes a new model (TERL - Transfer Expert Reinforcement Learning) that substantially improves RANK. The key difference with respect to the previous model is the decoupling of the mechanisms that generate the responsibility signals of experts for learning and for control. This made possible to satisfy different constraints for functioning and for learning. We test both the TERL and the RANK models with a two-DOFs dynamic arm engaged in solving multiple reaching tasks, and compare the two with a simple, flat reinforcement learning model. The results show that both models are capable of exploiting assimilation and accommodation processes in order to transfer knowledge between similar tasks, and at the same time to avoid catastrophic interference. Furthermore, the TERL model is shown to significantly outperform the RANK model thanks to its faster and more stable specialization of experts.","2161-9476","978-1-4673-4965-9","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400871","","Joints;Learning;Noise;Robot sensing systems;Interference;Face;Neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);robots","reinforcement learning algorithms;skill assimilation;skill accommodation;multiple motor skills;TERL;transfer expert reinforcement learning;2-DOF dynamic arm;knowledge transfer;supervised learning problems;simulated robot","","4","1","25","","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a challenging control problem and one of the major limitations of this type of cultures. The aim of this paper is to provide a simple dissolved oxygen control strategy capable of achieving high biomass levels by manipulating three process variables: agitation, aeration and oxygenation. This strategy was developed using a split-range control scheme specially designed so that the controller action is linear with respect to the maximum transfer rate (kLa·DO*). The controller parameters were tuned through simulation and later implemented and validated in Escherichia coli fed-batch cultivations. The strategy presented here allowed reaching high biomass concentrations while maintaining oxygen concentration at an appropriate level.

Our results show that channel shrinking results in an increase in time-to-breakdown values due to holes real-space-transfer effects occurring in thin channel devices. The breakdown behavior of thin-channel devices (channel thickness /spl les/20 nm) is dominated by the accumulation of holes in the InAlAs buffer layer; in thick-channel devices breakdown is due to the parasitic bipolar action of holes accumulating in the InGaAs channel.

Voice traffic in the battlefield is carried by Military Tactical Networks, which are primarily based on radio links. Most of these radio links have high Bit Error Rate (BER) due to extended ranges, low link margin and enemy jamming action. The bit errors introduced due to any/ combination of these factors results in high packet loss severely impacting voice quality. Packing multiple voice packets in large Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) Ethernet frames has high-transmission efficiency but large frames have higher probability of getting corrupted in BER conditions. Under such situations, reducing MTU frame has a positive impact on voice call quality. By reducing the MTU size the impact of frame corruption is decreased statically which preserves the voice quality. In this paper, we propose a novel network probe algorithm that selects optimum MTU size for layer 2 Ethernet frames carrying VoIP (Voice over IP) traffic. The probe samples all the network interfaces connected to a node for optimal MTU size. The extensive simulation carried out over a well known platform OMNeT++, reveals that optimum MTU size gave less packet loss and delay in Military Network topology.","","978-1-5386-8075-9","10.1109/I2CT45611.2019.9033868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9033868","Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU);Bit Error Rate (BER);Quality of Services (QoS);Military Tactical Networks;Wide Area Network (WAN)","Packet loss;Radio link;Bit error rate;Probes;Network topology;Wide area networks","error statistics;Internet telephony;jamming;military communication;mobile radio;network interfaces;quality of service;radio links;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","extended ranges;low link margin;enemy jamming action;bit errors;high packet loss;voice quality;multiple voice packets;high-transmission efficiency;BER conditions;MTU frame;frame corruption;optimum MTU size;layer 2 Ethernet frames;voice over IP;optimal MTU size;variable MTU size;voice packet;reduce packet loss;bandwidth constraint Military Network;control systems;tactical battlefield;high quality voice communications;Voice traffic;Military Tactical Networks;radio links;high Bit Error Rate;military network topology;network probe algorithm;maximum transmission unit Ethernet frames","","","","20","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to wind power is highly dependent on wind speed, which is naturally variable, severe stability problems can be caused in power systems, especially when the wind power has a high penetration level. To improve the stability of the MG, the control actions need to be more robust and efficient. Hence, this paper proposes the use of an energy storage system (ESS) based on Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), which uses the Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with power electronic technology to control the power transfer from/to the MG. Furthermore, the reactive power of the SMES is controlled using voltage source converter (VSC) to mitigate the voltage fluctuations. This control strategy has been tested out using different scenarios of wind speed gust, load shedding and loads restoring, which highly influence the power system operation. To prove the efficient performance of the proposed control strategy, an isolated MG comprises of squirrel cage induction generators (SCIG) as a wind turbine generator (WTG) and diesel synchronous generators; was investigated for the simulation using MATLAB/Simulink. Moreover, the proposed technique is compared with the conventional energy storage device like DC batteries.

Our approach makes use of observational estimates of the opacities of hydrogen and singly ionized helium in the intergalactic medium during this epoch. In particular, we model the reionization of He ii by sources of hard ultraviolet radiation, i.e. quasars, and infer values for our parametrization of this population from observational estimates of the opacity of the He ii Lyman-α forest. Next, we estimate the photoionization rate of H i from these sources and find that their contribution to the ionizing background is insufficient to account for the measured opacity of the H i Lyman-α forest at a redshift z∼ 3. This motivates us to include a soft, stellar component to the ionizing background to boost the hydrogen photoionization rate, but which has a negligible impact on the He ii opacity.In order to simultaneously match observational estimates of the H i and He ii opacities, we find that galaxies and quasars must contribute approximately equally to the ionizing background in H i at z≃ 3. Moreover, our analysis requires the stellar component to rise for z > 3 to compensate for the declining contribution from bright quasars at higher redshift. This inference is consistent with some observational and theoretical estimates of the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate. The increasing dominance of the stellar component towards high redshift leads to a progressive softening of the UV background, as suggested by observations of metal line absorption. In the absence of additional sources of ionizing radiation, such as mini-quasars or weak active galactic nuclei, our results, extrapolated to z > 5, suggest that hydrogen reionization at z∼ 6 mostly probably occurred through the action of stellar radiation.","1365-2966","","10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06308.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147644","radiative transfer;intergalactic medium;quasars: general;diffuse radiation","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For three-phase IM drives, many works have been reported either on the reduction or on the elimination of CM voltages that are generated due to pulse width modulation (PWM) action of the feeding power converters. However, for five-phase IM drives, very few studies are available with the perspective of the CM voltage elimination. Also, the effect of CM voltage on the mechanical vibrations of a five-phase IM has not been reported in the literature. Hence, in this paper, firstly, the modeling of CM current generated in the five-phase IM is done and its expression based on admittance transfer function is derived. Then the CM voltage is eliminated from a five-phase three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) voltage source inverter. The space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique is developed for the elimination of CM voltages. Only those switching states are selected which give zero CM voltage. The same selected switching states also give the balanced dc link capacitor voltages. Its effect is observed on the mechanical vibration of the motor and it is correlated with the CM current. The mechanical vibration is observed for both, with and without CM voltage elimination.

While the contaminants are evolving under the influence of nonlinear fluid flow field, the linear nature of the P-F operator is exploited for the design of estimator dynamics. In particular, the linear nature of the P-F framework is used for the design of a Kalman filtering algorithm to track the contaminants under an impulsive release scenario. Simulation results involving International Energy Agency (IEA) two dimensional building system model are presented to verify the main findings of the paper.","2378-5861","978-1-5386-7926-5","10.23919/ACC.2019.8814649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8814649","","Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Estimation;Buildings;Markov processes;Indoor environment;Pollution measurement","building management systems;contamination;hazardous materials;indoor environment;Kalman filters","indoor environment quality;nonlinear fluid flow field;contaminant distribution;Perron-Frobenius operator;Kalman filtering algorithm;international energy agency;two dimensional building system model;hazardous substance release scenario","","","","30","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We suspect this is because it is very complicated and time consuming to adjust the parameters to achieve meaningful results. The clinician has to take care of the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes and other parameters. Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre-computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint. Our system provides the physician with synchronized views which help to gain deeper insight into the medical data with minimal user interaction.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376185","Navigation;interaction;linked views;medical visualization;viewpoint selection.","Navigation;Biomedical imaging;Displays;Data visualization;Medical diagnostic imaging;Transfer functions;Anatomical structure;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;History","data visualisation;interactive systems;knowledge based systems;medical image processing;rendering (computer graphics)","LiveSync deformed viewing sphere;knowledge-based navigation;interactive volume rendering;visualization method;medical image","Algorithms;Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Anatomic;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","23","5","20","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The variety and complexity of each of these standards and concepts present a significant barrier to entry into e-business for many small companies. Approximately 20% of European companies buy and sell over the Internet with big companies buying and selling more. The challenge facing the eEurope action plan is to enable the ""small to medium sized enterprises"" (SMEs) to participate in e-business without over extending their resources. Aspiring e-business professionals in these small companies do not have the time or the resources needed to invest in understanding all these concepts and standards. They need to understand the concepts and standards quickly before deciding to invest their time in the area or not. We discuss the development of an e-business skillset enhancement tool (eSET) for B2B integration scenarios through the development of a working model of an e-business environment that can assist the SMEs and advanced 3rd level students in introducing them to the world of B2B. This enables them to experience the B2B environment professionals to see how their enterprise can use e-business and B2B. They can see data in the electronic environment, experience the transfer of data electronically over the Internet, view their processes modeled and simulated. They can see an e-business B2B environment processing their data using their business processes. This enables them to make an informed decision before investment in this area. The existing problem is that there is no easily accessible environment available for either students, who feed into the SMEs, or professionals to experiment and interact with.","","0-7803-8200-5","10.1109/INDIN.2003.1300257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300257","","Companies;Business;Information technology;Communication networks;Internet;Industrial economics;Manufacturing industries;Shipbuilding industry;Europe;Investments","electronic commerce;small-to-medium enterprises;Internet;organisational aspects;XML;supply chains;enterprise resource planning","e-business skillset enhancement tool;business-to-business;B2B process integration scenario;Internet;eEurope action plan;small to medium sized enterprise;eSET;SME;electronic data transfer;EDI;XML;EAI;supply chain;ERP;BizTalk","","","3","17","","1 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasingly, deep learning-driven Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is used for decision-making when planning corrective action of quality defects. However, given the current absence of scalability enabling models, training deep learning models for each individual MAS is exceedingly time-consuming as it requires large amounts of labelled data and multiple computational cycles. Additionally, understanding and interpreting how deep learning produces final predictions while quantifying various uncertainties also remains a fundamental challenge. In an effort to address these gaps, a novel closed-loop in-process (CLIP) diagnostic framework underpinned algorithm portfolio is proposed which simultaneously enhances scalability and interpretability of the current Bayesian deep learning approach, Object Shape Error Response (OSER), to isolate root cause(s) of quality defects in MAS. The OSER-MAS leverages a Bayesian 3D U-Net architecture integrated with Computer-Aided Engineering simulations to estimate root causes. The CLIP diagnostic framework shortens OSER-MAS model training time by developing: (i) closed-loop training to enable faster convergence for a single MAS by leveraging uncertainty estimates of the Bayesian 3D U-net model; and, (ii) transfer/continual learning-based scalability model to transmit meta-knowledge from the trained model to a new MAS resulting in convergence using comparatively less training samples. Additionally, CLIP increases the transparency for quality-related root cause predictions by developing interpretability model which is based on 3D Gradient-based Class Activation Maps (3D Grad-CAMs) and entails: (a) linking elements of MAS model with functional elements of the U-Net architecture; and, (b) relating features extracted by the architecture with elements of the MAS model and further with the object shape error patterns for root cause(s) that occur in MAS. Benchmarking studies are conducted using six automotive-MAS with varying complexities. Results highlight a reduction in training samples of up to 56% with a loss in performance of up to 2.1%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068867","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9386067","Bayesian Deep Learning;Continual Learning;Transfer Learning;Multi-station Assembly;U-Net;3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);Manufacturing","Deep learning;Shape;Solid modeling;Scalability;Bayes methods;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling","","","","","","","CCBY","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We propose an adaptive cyber security monitoring system that integrates a number of component techniques to collect time-series situation information, perform intrusion detection, keep track of event evolution, characterize and identify security events, and present a visual representation in order to provide comprehensive situational view so that corresponding defense actions can be taken in a timely and effective manner. We explore the principles of designing and applying appropriate visualization techniques for situation monitoring by defining graphical representations of security events. This differs from the traditional rule-based pattern matching techniques in that security events in the proposed system are represented as forms of correlation networks using random matrix theory and identified through the computation of network similarity measurement. The events and corresponding event types are visualized using a stemplot to show location and quantity. Extensive simulation results on event identification illustrate the efficacy of the proposed system.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925091","Cyber security;event correlation;information visualization;random matrix theory;visual analysis","Monitoring;Data security;Information security;Computer security;Data visualization;Protection;Humans;Cognition;Decision making;Intrusion detection","decision making;Internet;matrix algebra;security of data;time series","security events;correlation technique;data transfer;malicious attacks;cyber space situation awareness;translation mechanisms;human cognition;decision making;action support;adaptive cyber security monitoring system;time-series situation information;intrusion detection;event evolution;correlation networks;random matrix theory;network similarity measurement;stemplot","","5","","16","","15 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How much it is surrounded by skull tissues, each layer of brain can absorb electromagnetic radiation, easily. As a result of absorption, local temperature will increase depending on the electrical properties of head layers. In this way, many negative biological actions may occur. In this paper, finite element method based specific absorption rate (SAR) simulation has been carried out and evaluated the temperature distribution in the head model. A rectangular patch antenna, which is modelled equally for mobile phone, has been accepted as an electromagnetic radiation source for this scenario. Head model has been mimicked as multi-layer sphere. The model consists of skin, cancellous bone, cortical bone, dura mater, cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter and white matter, respectively. Each layer has consisted of realistic thickness and individual properties. Electrical and thermal properties of each tissues have been selected through the literature survey. Working frequency is selected as 835 MHz. Simulation results indicated that the most induced SAR values were observed in skin and cerebrospinal fluid. Apart from electrical properties, SAR values are decreasing exponentially along each tissue. It is observed that the head temperature was increased.

Simplified dynamics of building clusters and building-integrated power networks with algebraic equations are presented-both operating at different time-scales. A model predictive control-based algorithm that formulates the BtG integration and accounts for the time-scale discrepancy is developed. The formulation captures dynamic and algebraic power flow constraints of power networks and is shown to be numerically advantageous. This paper analytically establishes that the BtG integration yields a reduced total system cost in comparison with decoupled designs where grid and building operators determine their controls separately. The developed framework is tested on standard power networks that include thousands of buildings modeled using industrial data. Case studies demonstrate building energy savings and significant frequency regulation, while these findings carry over in network simulations with nonlinear power flows and mismatch in building model parameters. Finally, simulations indicate that the performance does not significantly worsen when there is uncertainty in the forecasted weather and base load conditions.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2017.2761861","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063955","Buildings-to-grid integration;MPC;demand response;energy efficiency;frequency regulation","Buildings;Power system dynamics;Mathematical model;Power grids;Load modeling;Heat transfer;Uncertainty","algebra;building management systems;buildings (structures);energy conservation;load flow;mathematical analysis;power grids;power system control;predictive control;transmission networks","algebraic power flow constraints;building operators;standard power networks;network simulations;nonlinear power flows;building model parameters;smart cities;power grids operators;building-integrated power networks;algebraic equations;model predictive control;mathematical framework;buildings-to-grid integration","","3","","43","","10 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is very important to be able to estimate a driver's drowsiness level online so that preventative actions could be taken to avoid accidents. However, because of large individual differences, it is very challenging to design an estimation algorithm whose parameters fit all subjects. Some subject-specific calibration data must be used to tailor the algorithm for each new subject. This paper proposes a domain adaptation with model fusion (DAMF) online drowsiness estimation approach using EEG signals. By making use of EEG data from other subjects in a transfer learning framework, DAMF requires very little subject-specific calibration data, which significantly increases its utility in practice. We demonstrate using a simulated driving experiment and 15 subjects that DAMF can achieve much better performance than several other approaches.","2156-8111","978-1-4799-9953-8","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344682","Drowsy driving;EEG;domain adaptation;model fusion;transfer learning","Vehicles;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Calibration;Estimation;Adaptation models;Accidents","driver information systems;electroencephalography;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents","online driver drowsiness estimation;motor vehicle accidents;domain adaptation with model fusion;DAMF online drowsiness estimation approach;EEG signals;transfer learning framework;subject-specific calibration data","","12","","26","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a policy is computed by means of simulation where a hydrodynamic model of the vehicle simulates the cable following task. Once the simulated results are accurate enough, in a second step, the learned-in-simulation policy is transferred to the vehicle where the learning procedure continues in a real environment, improving the initial policy. The natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm has been selected to solve the problem in both steps. This algorithm aims to take advantage of policy gradient and value function techniques for fast convergence.

A case study involving merging and spacing operations is provided in which allocations of authority are created to minimize information transfer between agents under varying responsibility allocations and varying requirements for balancing taskload across agents.

Electroexplosive opening switches are often implemented due to their long conduction time of large currents, large and fast change of impedance, and high dielectric strength. Due to the complex relationship between the circuit current and switch impedance, numerical modeling methods are required to understand the dynamic switch and circuit behavior. The resistivity of electroexplosive opening switches can be described in terms of the specific energy dissipated in the switch or the specific action. The specific energy and specific action are dependent on the integral of the square of the current through the switch. The current through the switch is also dependent on the impedance of the switch. Therefore, an iterative process using numerical methods is required to model the switch resistivity and its effects on circuit behavior. A Matlab program was written to simulate an electroexplosive opening switch in a power conditioning circuit with an inductive energy store. The program was developed assuming the source was a flux compression generator, but additional sources can be modeled. An inductor or a transformer can be used as the inductive energy storage element. The program can allow simulation of a resistive load, representing a high power microwave source, the capacitive load of a high power RF source, or an inductive load. A detailed description of the development of the program is provided. Simulation results are included for an exploding wire fuse with a resistive load.","2158-4923","978-1-4244-4064-1","10.1109/PPC.2009.5386208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386208","","Power system modeling;Power conditioning;Switching circuits;Switches;Mathematical model;Impedance;Energy storage;Conductivity;Circuit simulation;Dielectric breakdown","inductive energy storage;iterative methods;power transformers","power conditioning circuit;electroexplosive opening switch;inductive energy storage;transfer energy;dielectric strength;iterative process;Matlab program;inductive energy store;flux compression generator;inductor;transformer;high power microwave source;exploding wire fuse","","1","","10","","19 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely used in power and microprocessor applications, most of which involve large areas to be used for heat transfer. However, for years thermal overload failure of power modules and chips has been a pressing problem due to pump-out of thermal grease as a die or module thermal interface material (TIM): Most thermal greases are Bingham fluids and thus not solids, so they can be squeezed out from in between the gap, driven by thermo-mechanical action of the adjacent layers as e.g. DCB substrate or silicon chip with the heat sink. Today, thermal greases have to be qualified in lengthy stress tests in a product relevant environment which consumes substantial resources as often a system test is required. Therefore, a fast test is necessary which accelerates testing and thus allows a fast screening of commercial greases on one hand, and guidelines for material development on the other. For that purpose this paper addresses this topic in a combined simulative and experimental way, where at the same time a novel test procedure is proposed for accelerated grease pump-out testing (GPOT) in the framework of a completely new approach, combining loading with in-situ failure analytical techniques and decoupling thermal from mechanical loading. This allows for the first time a realistic loading of greases during accelerated testing with testing times below one hour. The method is demonstrated on various commercial and custom greases, varying their composition and structure, and benchmarked against industry standard thermal cycling tests. Further, two fundamental failure mechanisms have been identified being at work simultaneously, notably fluid transport (which constitutes actually a pump-in phenomenon) and air entrapment. We were able to identify key properties of the materials and loading variables, on which their intensity depends.","","978-1-5386-8040-7","10.1109/EuroSimE.2019.8724540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8724540","","Thermal conductivity;Testing;Conductivity;Life estimation;Thermal stresses;Stress;Loading","adhesion;adhesives;failure analysis;finite element analysis;greases;heat sinks;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;life testing;microprocessor chips;thermal conductivity;thermal management (packaging);thermal resistance;thermal stresses","simple application;thermal adhesives;pads;thermal grease;module thermal interface material;lengthy stress tests;accelerated grease pump-out;accelerated testing;industry standard thermal cycling tests;medium thermal conductivities;thermal overload failure;accelerated pump out testing;TIM;material development;accelerated grease pump-out testing;GPOT;failure analytical techniques;mechanical loading;thermal loading","","","","18","","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Barter Cast is a reputation mechanism used in the Internet-deployed Tribler file-sharing client. In this paper we study the opportunities for sybil attacks in Barter Cast and we devise a method for making Barter Cast sybil resilient, which is incorporated in a protocol called Sybil Res. Like in Barter Cast, in Sybil Res each peer maintains a local subjective weighted directed graph reflecting data transfer actions in Tribler, from which it computes the reputations of other peers using a flow based algorithm taking the edge weights as flows. In Sybil Res, after an upload action, the uploading peer discounts the weights of the edges on the paths from the down loader to itself. As a consequence, due to the way reputations are computed, the reputation of a peer performing a sybil attack decreases fast. To mitigate the negative impact of edge weight discounting on the reputations of honest peers, after a download action, the downloading peer increases the weights of the edges on the paths from the up loader to itself. We demonstrate that Sybil Res is effective in practice by means of trace-driven simulations using data collected from the Tribler network. The results show that Sybil Res effectively marginalizes attackers while having a minimal effect on the reputations of honest peers.","1063-6927","978-1-4577-0295-2","10.1109/ICDCS.2012.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6257993","Sybil Attack;Reputation Systems;Distributed Systems","Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Measurement;Mechanical factors;Robustness;Buildings;Social network services","electronic data interchange;Internet;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","SybilRes;sybil-resilient flow-based decentralized reputation mechanism;cheap identity creation;decentralized online reputation mechanisms;sybil attacks;Internet-deployed tribler file-sharing client;BarterCast sybil resilient;subjective weighted directed graph;data transfer;flow based algorithm;uploading peer;edge weight discounting;honest peers;downloading peer;trace-driven simulations;Tribler network","","6","","22","","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The CPU not only coordinates the actions performed by the GPU, but it also computes the inflow, bifurcation and outflow points. The GPU operations have been included in a single kernel, which has been optimized towards high computational intensity and low global memory throughput in order to obtain good results even for small arterial trees. Although the amount of data to be transferred between CPU and GPU is small, its scattered nature has lead to an approach where the entire arrays are copied back and forth. The speed-up obtained for the code migrated from the host to the device is of around 30×, while the speed-up of the entire application is of 4.5-4.7×. An important property of the proposed approach is that the speed-up obtained remains constant for arterial trees which are up to ten times smaller than e regular tree representing the large arteries of the human cardiovascular system.

However, there is an inaccurate line-rate control in KOMPSAT-3A that causes motion blur. This induces an along-track modulation transfer function (MTF) value that is smaller than the across-track MTF value. The motion blur degrades image quality and tends to deteriorate the performance of various computer vision algorithms such as object detection, segmentation, feature detection, and matching. Thus, in order to enhance the visual quality of blurry images, a motion deblurring algorithm is necessary. However, there are few studies about solving motion blur of satellite images. Most studies have been focused on the motion blur of general images taken by smart phones, action cameras, and DSLRs. To solve the satellite image problem, we propose a model for motion deblurring of satellite images and generate training data using the proposed model and KOMPSAT-3A data. In addition, we trained a residual and dense block-based convolutional neural network (CNN). To verify the residual and dense block-based CNN, we utilized simulated blurred images and actual blurry KOMPSAT-3A images. As a result, we confirmed that the proposed method reliably removes more motion blur than do conventional CNN-based motion deblur methods. Additionally, our method made the along-track and across-track MTF values similar. In addition, overall the MTF values increased. The results show that effective learning is possible for use in reducing motion deblurring of satellite images effectively.","","978-1-7281-3857-2","10.1109/DICTA47822.2019.8945977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945977","Motion blur;KOMPSAT-3A;remote sensing;deep neural network","Satellites;Kernel;Convolution;Video sequences;Data models;Training data","cameras;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;image motion analysis;image restoration;motion estimation;object detection;optical transfer function","conventional CNN-based motion deblur methods;across-track MTF value;MTF values;blind motion deblurring;inaccurate line-rate control;along-track modulation transfer function value;motion blur degrades image quality;blurry images;motion deblurring algorithm;general images;satellite image problem;residual block-based convolutional neural network;dense block-based convolutional neural network;residual block-based CNN;dense block-based CNN;actual blurry KOMPSAT-3A","","1","","29","","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our research focuses on the problem of a vehicle sharing the environment with a human passenger/driver and, specifically, of designing a controller that captures the natural tendencies of the human driver so as to guarantee that the resulting control action is comparable to that of the human. In this paper, we propose to use a human driver control model into the autonomous vehicle control framework, which has previously been shown to predict short-term driver actions, and we develop an approach that reliably and accurately estimates input-feature values from driver-point-of-view images. After the feature-input values have been estimated, the human driver control model computes the corresponding steering-wheel angle. We, thus, provide more structure to the overall processing pipeline, compared to the recent end-to-end approaches. The proposed approach is validated using numerical simulations with synthetic images. The results validate the importance of combining traditional structured (e.g., transfer function) models with parsimonious neural-network representations.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2019.2919476","NSF; Funai Foundation for Information Technology; Ito Foundation USA-FUTI Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723597","Intelligent vehicles;autonomous vehicles;Bayes methods;vehicle driving","Computational modeling;Roads;Hidden Markov models;Autonomous vehicles;Reliability;Predictive models","mobile robots;path planning;position control;predictive control;road vehicles;robot vision;steering systems","resulting control action;human driver control model;autonomous vehicle control framework;short-term driver actions;driver-point-of-view images;feature-input values;vision-based autonomous path;reliable input-feature value estimation;vehicle sharing the environment;controller design;vision-based autonomous path following","","1","","57","Traditional","28 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output) system with two inputs (hot and cold water) and two outputs (level and temperature process variable), where the system actuators are 12V pumps to control the two input levels. In the second tank, the temperature is controlled independently by a heating resistor. The control actions on the level and temperature variables can be supervised and have their SetPoints changed via a graphical interface. To simplify the controllers tuning, the control loop decoupling technique was used, seeking to decrease the interaction between them. Simulations and tests were performed to choose the best controller configuration, which in turn was embedded in an Arduino MEGA2560 board. The tests carried out showed that the significant interaction between control loops interfere in an incisive way in the controller's performance for large temperature SetPoints.

At first, the whole 3D shape and reflectance of the object are prepared using several rangefinders. Each rangefinder is constructed with a camera, projector and PC (personal computer), and all PCs are connected with each other via a network. For tracking the object, several CG images with varied object pose and position are generated in each PC using the object model, and then compared to the input intensity image in parallel. The result of the comparison is transferred to a master PC, and the pose and position of the object are estimated by minimizing the residual of the CG and input images. We made a special CG generator, which is a precise simulator of the real camera to generate a CG image identical to the input image.

Exact positioning and high precision tracking of the end-effector along a given path are key requirements. Due to flexibility and non minimum phase nature of the system, achieving high level performances is a challenging problem. To this purpose a two degrees of freedom control scheme is proposed: a feedforward action, denoted by r (t), is applied to the stable closed loop system Σf,c, given by the feedback connection of the flexible arm with a stabilizing controller. The recently proposed pseudo inversion approach is adopted to compute r(t) yielding an actual end-effector transient trajectory which is the best approximation of the desired transient one. The optimal r(t) is assumed to be given by a B-spline function, and, to take into account saturating actuators, the actual control input u(t) forcing the flexible arm is optimally approximated by a B-spline u(t), whose control points u(t) are chosen in such a way to satisfy the saturation constraints on u(t). If u(t) is a sufficiently accurate approximation of u(t), the exact fulfillment of saturation constraints by u(t) are transferred to u(t). The main advantage of the approach is its generality: the method can be directly applied to the linear dynamic model of any multilink flexible arm.","2473-3504","978-1-5386-7890-9","10.1109/MED.2018.8443070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443070","","Splines (mathematics);Transient analysis;Steady-state;Trajectory;Manipulators;Feedforward systems","actuators;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;end effectors;feedback;feedforward;flexible manipulators;manipulator dynamics;position control;splines (mathematics);stability;tracking","account saturating actuators;actual control input;linear dynamic model;multilink flexible arm;optimal end-effector positioning;numerical simulation;link flexible manipulator linearized model;potential possibility;B-spline function;actual end-effector transient trajectory;recently proposed pseudoinversion approach;stabilizing controller;loop system;freedom control scheme;high level performances;high precision tracking;exact positioning;control effort;saturation constraints;end-effector positioning task;optimal output transition problem","","","","24","","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Iterative Learning Controller learns to generate the desired set of input signals to compensate for the output tracking errors. Conventionally the performance of ILC algorithms has been based on the convergence of the output tracking error. In this paper, the convergence of the control input is investigated down to the sample-time level. Two scenarios are considered: Firstly, when the control input is updated with same initial conditions at the start of each batch/repetition/iteration/trial and secondly for varying initial conditions. The batch to batch evolution of control inputs at each sample time within a batch is formulated. Convergence of the control input signals has been based on the Eigen analysis of this relationship. This provides deeper insight about the ILC algorithms and exact factors affecting the convergence could be monitored. Limits of the learning process are clearly demonstrated as well. Performance of D-type & PD-type ILC algorithms has been investigated for a simple pendulum and further extended to bipedal locomotion. Bipedal walking robot is an interesting control problem but involves complexity being a hybrid system. It comprises of single support, impact with ground and double support phases. The non-linear impacts pose challenge since they cause non-zero initial errors for each step. For reasons of energy efficiency, passive dynamics has been chosen for compass gait model of the biped. Stable gait achieved from a fine-tuned PD controller provides the set of desired inputs for the joints of the compass gait robot. ILC learns/adapts the joint control for repetitive gaits. It represents learning a sequence of action by muscles. Due to the transfer of state error in a cyclic manner from the end of a previous step/repetition to the recent step/repetition, the convergence has to be established in joint control and state space. The steady gait is achieved for bipedal locomotion on flat surface as demonstrated through simulations.","2151-1411","978-1-4577-1929-5","10.1109/IBCAST.2012.6177517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177517","Cyclic Iterative Learning Control;Convergence;bipedal walking robot","Clocks","gait analysis;iterative methods;learning systems;legged locomotion;motion control;path planning;PD control","convergence analysis;cyclic iterative learning control scheme;output tracking error;control input convergence;sample-time level;batch to batch evolution;control input signal;eigen analysis;learning process;PD-type ILC algorithm;bipedal locomotion;bipedal walking robot;hybrid system complexity;nonlinear impacts;nonzero initial error;energy efficiency;passive dynamics;compass gait model;fine-tuned PD controller;compass gait robot;muscles action;state error transfer;state space","","2","","27","","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The solution that many have turned to is to use simulation for training before deploying the robot in a real environment. Simulation offers the ability to train large numbers of robots in parallel, and offers an abundance of data. However, no simulation is perfect, and robots trained solely in simulation fail to generalize to the real-world, resulting in a “sim-vs-real gap”. How can we overcome the trade-off between the abundance of less accurate, artificial data from simulators and the scarcity of reliable, real-world data? In this letter, we propose Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BDA), a novel approach to bridge the sim-vs-real gap in both directions– real2sim to bridge the visual domain gap, and sim2real to bridge the dynamics domain gap. We demonstrate the benefits of BDA on the task of PointGoal Navigation.

Hybrid radio frequency/visible light communication (RF/VLC) has appeared as a promising mechanism for achieving this objective. In hybrid RF/VLC, data rate maximization is subject to constraints on bandwidth, power and the user association. The joint optimization problem of bandwidth, power and user association to maximize the data rate is non-concave and obtaining an optimal solution is difficult with conventional optimization algorithms. The existing solutions are based on a presumption of at least one optimization variable. In this article, this issue has been overcome by solving the joint optimization problem in hybrid RF/VLC with a deep Q-network (DQN) learning based algorithm, which has been recognized as an efficient learning based mechanism for optimization. Our system model considers one RF and multiple VLC access points (APs). The idle APs are also incorporated in the system model. The application of DQN learning based algorithm is carried out by finding an optimal policy with the help of an action-value function. As the data sets for the considered system are large, a multi-layered network is used for approximating the action-value function estimator. Finally, a transfer learning based algorithm has been proposed for maximizing the total data rate of the system for the case of a newly entering user equipment (UE) that uses the information of the environment before the arrival of the new UE. Through simulations, it is found that our proposed algorithms can lead to an improvement of more than 10% and 54% in the achievable sum-rate and number of iterations for convergence respectively as compared to that obtained with existing conventional optimization algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014427","Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong; Basic Research Foundation of Shenzhen City; Industry-University-Research Innovation Fund of Science and Technology Development Center of Ministry of Education-New Generation Information Technology Innovation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159585","Achievable sum-rate;access points;bandwidth;radio frequency (RF);visible light communication (VLC);hybrid RF/VLC;power;user equipment;user association;deep Q-network (DQN) learning","Resource management;Bandwidth;Optimization;Downlink;Radio frequency;Hybrid power systems;Data models","5G mobile communication;free-space optical communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","downlink resource allocation;high data rate systems;fifth generation mobile systems;data rate maximization;user association;joint optimization problem;deep Q-network learning based algorithm;multiple VLC access points;optimal policy;data sets;multilayered network;action-value function estimator;transfer learning based algorithm;total data rate;user equipment;conventional optimization algorithms;hybrid RF/VLC systems;hybrid radio frequency/visible light communication","","1","","77","CCBY","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The controller uses only one measurable feedback signal (generator speed deviation). A reduced-order version of this controller is also obtained. The robust control results are compared to the ""idealistic"" full state optimal control. Simulation results revealed that the technique damps all torsional oscillatory modes in a very short time, yet maintains reasonable control actions.","","0-7803-5935-6","10.1109/PESW.2000.850183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850183","","Robust control;Power system measurements;Velocity measurement;Feedback;Signal generators;Optimal control","power system control;control system synthesis;robust control;torsion;oscillations;linear quadratic Gaussian control;damping;reduced order systems;feedback;control system analysis","power systems;self-excited torsional oscillation countermeasures;reduced order robust control approach;linear quadratic Gaussian;loop transfer recovery;control design;feedback signal;generator speed deviation;reduced-order version;control simulation;state optimal control","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The instability which is caused by weakened ligaments as well as worn cartilages makes the carpal bones to move freely, causing a painful condition. Wrist arthroplasty is one of the treatments for severe cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis of the wrist joint. This project involved biomechanical analysis of wrist arthroplasty in terms of its ability to provide carpal stability for replacement of the joint severely affected wrist with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The clinical symptoms of the skeletal disease such as the pathological changes of the bone, cartilage, ligaments, tendon as well as the load transfer were used to accurately simulate the wrist joint affected with Rheumatoid Arthritis. To do so, three dimensional models of these two wrist models were developed from computed tomography images which consist of 8 carpal bones, 5 metacarpal bones, the distal radius and ulna. The cartilages were developed based on the shape of the articulation and ligaments were simulated via springs. Hand grip action was simulated as the boundary conditions in which the compressive contact pressure were applied on the model with resultant force of 15.92N in magnitude, distributed over the 5 digits, applied on the metacarpals. Normal, healthy wrist joint was also modelled and functions as the control. Results showed that the stability and load transfer of the wrist after arthroplasty were successfully restored similar to the behaviour of the normal wrist joint. The carpal bones at the model of Rheumatoid Arthritis displaced higher compared to the wrist after treatment, due to the laxity of the ligaments. This high displacement hence leads to the instability of the wrist joint as well as the abnormalities of the load transfer whereby lower load transfer generated at the Rheumatoid Arthritis model. Meanwhile, the model after arthroplasty depicted good stability as well as well load transfer at the forearm in comparison with the normal healthy wrist. These indicate the reliability of the finite element analyses to the clinical findings. These simulations managed to provide the most accurate representations of hand grip action for the pathological wrist as well as the one simulating the treated wrist through arthroplasty. The models developed in this study can be used as a benchmark for simulating other complex human joints as well as simulating their pathological condition and a suitable surgical treatment. Through biomechanical simulation, this project has helped in the understanding of the wrist joint, the pathomechanics of Rheumatoid Arthritis associated with the joint and the development of implants for wrist arthroplasty.","","978-1-4244-7600-8","10.1109/IECBES.2010.5742242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5742242","finite element analysis;wrist;rheumatoid arthritis;arthroplasty;stability","Wrist;Bones;Arthritis;Joints;Ligaments;Implants;Stress","biomechanics;bone;computerised tomography;diseases;finite element analysis;mechanical stability;medical image processing;prosthetics;surgery","biocomputational comparative study;rheumatoid arthritis;wrist joint;arthroplasty;carpal stability analysis;instability;symptoms;worn cartilages;carpal bones;biomechanical analysis;carpal stability;skeletal disease;pathological changes;bone;ligaments;tendon;computed tomography images;metacarpal bones;distal radius;ulna;hand grip action;compressive contact pressure;finite element analysis;surgical treatment;pathomechanics;implants","","1","","32","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To compute this estimate, we propose a definition of the nonlinear observability matrix with respect to a future state and establish its connection with the filtering Cramer-Rao lower bound at the future state. We also define a sensitivity function that correlates noise on control inputs to errors on the state estimate. As a demonstrative example, we consider the problem of relative navigation of two unmanned aerial systems in Global Positioning System denied environments.

The VMOs want to provide subscribed users with the best performance while ensuring minimal leasing costs. We aim to find the optimal resource leasing scheme for a VMO in order to maximize utility within the uncertainties of harvested energy, request arrivals, and resource prices. We first formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, during which the VMOs compete with each other for the radio resources by dynamically announcing their resource requirements to the MNO. We, then, employ a deep Q-learning algorithm so the VMO can find the optimal solution by interacting with the environment. With this algorithm, artificial neural networks are used to approximate the Q-value function, which can work effectively with large state and action spaces. We further employ the idea of transfer learning, which exploits the strategies learned in historical periods to speed up the learning process of the target task.

In the beginning of each epoch (every T time slots are defined as one epoch), the leaders update their power adaptation policies by knowing the best-responses of all followers, while the followers compete against each other in each time slot with only the leaders' action information. The hierarchy in learning procedure indicates the macrocell states in any two consecutive epochs are highly correlated. Then the small-cells' historical policy information can be leveraged to enhance the learning performance. Accordingly, a combined learning framework is established, through combining the Stackelberg learning formulation and the technique of transfer learning, to tell players how to plan the action decisions.

Hybrid BCIs consider the combination of several modalities, including brain responses, for new communication systems.

Such a model allows one to take advantage of the information available in real time on the arrival or departure of carriers with the corresponding amounts of containers scheduled for loading or unloading. The resulting strategy of resource allocation can be regarded as a feedback control law and is obtained by solving nonlinear programming problems online. Since the computation may be too expensive, a technique based on the idea of approximating offline such a law is proposed. The approximation is performed by using neural networks, which allow one to construct an approximate feedback controller and generate the corresponding online control actions with a negligible computational burden.

However, ship power systems produce a lot of greenhouse gases, which in turn lead to serious environmental pollution. Hence, the utilizing of wind turbines (WTs), solar generation, sea wave energy (SWE), and energy storage systems (ESSs) in marine vessel power systems have been attracting a lot of attention in recent years. In this paper, it is assumed that a marine vessel power system with photovoltaic (PV), WT, SWE, and ESS can be regarded as a mobile-islanded MG. Then, a novel topology for hybrid shipboard microgrids (MGs) is presented. Next, in order to make a balance between consumption and power generation in shipboard MGs, an optimal modified model-free nonlinear sliding mode controller is introduced for the secondary load frequency control. Since the quality of the control actions of the proposed model-free approach depends on its parameters, a hybrid version of the sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) and wavelet-mutation (WM), called SCAWM, is employed to find the best value of these coefficients. Comparisons are conducted with other existing methodologies, such as model predictive control, interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller, and conventional PI (PI) to establish the supremacy of the newly suggested control strategy. Finally, a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation based on OPAL-RT is accomplished to affirm the applicability of the suggested controller, from a systemic perspective, for the load frequency control problem in the shipboard MG.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2911210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8721112","Frequency regulation;model-free nonlinear sliding mode controller (MFNSMC);on-board power grid;sine-cosine algorithm (SCA);wavelet mutation (WM)","Frequency control;Marine vehicles;Load modeling;Power systems;Wind turbines;Wind speed;Computational modeling","air pollution;distributed power generation;energy storage;frequency control;hardware-in-the loop simulation;load regulation;marine power systems;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;photovoltaic power systems;robust control;ships;variable structure systems;wave power generation;wind turbines","optimal modified model-free nonlinear sliding mode controller;photovoltaic system;model-free approach;wavelet-mutation;SCAWM;OPAL-RT;real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation;sine-cosine algorithm;wind turbines;greenhouse gases;environmental pollution;ship power systems;weapons;mobile microgrids;robust frequency regulation;load frequency control problem;model predictive control;secondary load frequency control;power generation;hybrid shipboard microgrids;mobile-islanded MG;marine vessel power system;energy storage systems;sea wave energy;solar generation","","15","","44","IEEE","23 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this purpose, a receiver solution based on a mixed-analog/digital-domain channelizer can be advantageous, with added benefits regarding system reconfigurability and parallelization of multiband signal processing. Here, a novel receiver architecture using this approach for the commented application is described, with a special focus on the IF hybrid filter bank as its core element. The analog part of the hybrid filter bank is a 50-100-MHz eight-channel analog multiplexer inspired in the human hearing system. The associated digital block can be co-synthesized as a discrete-time filter bank to invert the action of the IF analog channelizer. As a benefit, hardware imperfections inherent to the analog circuitry can be easily counteracted at the digital level. Furthermore, such a channelization enables low-cost analog-to-digital converters to be utilized for the sampling of the signal sub-bands to be later digitally processed for the overall signal reconstruction. For validation, measured and simulated results of a proof-of-concept prototype for the analog channelizer are shown. Besides, the inversion of the measured transfer functions of this multiplexing device by means of the application of the co-designed digital filter bank is demonstrated. An experiment is also carried out showing the reconstruction of a band-limited noise signal with the developed hybrid filter bank.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2013.2246184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470728","Analog-to-digital converter (ADC);bio-inspired circuit;channelizer;cochlea-based circuit;cognitive radio;digital filter;hybrid filter bank;multiplexer;pre-selector;software-defined radio;wireless technologies;ultra-wideband systems","Receivers;Multiplexing;Radio frequency;Dynamic range;Bandwidth;Filter banks;Noise","analogue-digital conversion;channel bank filters;cognitive radio;discrete time filters;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;multiplexing;radio receivers;signal reconstruction;signal sampling;software radio;transfer functions","bioinspired hybrid filter bank;RF spectrum;analog-to-digital front-end;cognitive radio;software-defined radio receiver;sampling rate;broadband frequency-sparse signal;receiver solution;mixed-analog/digital-domain channelizer;system reconfigurability;parallelization;multiband signal processing;receiver architecture;IF hybrid filter bank;eight-channel analog multiplexer;human hearing system;digital block;discrete-time filter bank;IF analog channelizer;hardware imperfection;analog circuitry;channelization;low-cost analog-to-digital converter;signal subband sampling;transfer function;multiplexing device;codesigned digital filter bank;band-limited noise signal reconstruction;frequency 50 MHz to 100 MHz","","21","1","36","","25 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stress test model is intended to emulate the effect of security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) in support of the required power transfer level, and at the same time, to account for relay actions in response to a given set of severe disturbances, called maximum credible disturbances. The model includes an inner stage, which simulates cascading outages due to relay actions in the system at a given state under disturbances, and an outer stage, which moves the operating point of the system as the power transfer increases as a result of SCED. We use the stress test model to simulate cascading failures in a real 3000-bus power system when increasing its power transfer level in different directions.","","978-1-4577-0419-2","10.1109/NAPS.2011.6025200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6025200","","Stress;Power system faults;Power system protection;Load modeling;Protective relaying","failure analysis;load dispatching;power grids;power system security;power transmission control;power transmission economics;power transmission reliability;risk analysis","stress test model;cascading failures;power grids;power blackouts;electric power system control;risk analysis;security-constrained economic dispatch;power transfer level;cascading outages;SCED","","","","14","","22 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The student makes all the settings wanted on the client computer and then sends them to a lab server. The server makes measurements requested and returns the data obtained. The whole procedure takes only a second or two. A number of clients can access the experiments simultaneously. The laboratory is used in ordinary courses for on-campus students.

We use 4-segments rigid body biomechanical model with 3 degrees-of-freedom built on average anatomical proportions. In this controlling scheme, we adopt the output feedback computing through physiologically relevant optimization based upon center of mass (COM) and ground reaction forces (GRF). Furthermore, the output feedback provides passive control action commands including a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based function augmented with nonlinear function computed with feedback linearization. The reference trajectories generate active feed forward torques, in addition with passive torques to settle the motion profiles within human anatomical constraints.

Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise at automatically learning controllers for complex systems in simulation. This has been followed by a push towards learning controllers that can be transferred between simulation and hardware, primarily with the use of domain randomization. However, domain randomization can make the problem of finding stable controllers even more challenging, especially for under actuated bipedal robots. In this work, we explore whether policies learned in simulation can be transferred to hardware with the use of high-fidelity simulators and structured controllers. We learn a neural network policy which is a part of a more structured controller. While the neural network is learned in simulation, the rest of the controller stays fixed, and can be tuned by the expert as needed. We show that using this approach can greatly speed up the rate of learning in simulation, as well as enable transfer of policies between simulation and hardware. We present our results on an ATRIAS robot and explore the effect of action spaces and cost functions on the rate of transfer between simulation and hardware. Our results show that structured policies can indeed be learned in simulation and implemented on hardware successfully. This has several advantages, as the structure preserves the intuitive nature of the policy, and the neural network improves the performance of the hand-designed policy. In this way, we propose a way of using neural networks to improve expert designed controllers, while maintaining ease of understanding.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8793864","","Neural networks;Hardware;Legged locomotion;Reinforcement learning;Torso;Foot","control system synthesis;learning (artificial intelligence);legged locomotion;neurocontrollers","deep reinforcement learning;expert knowledge;domain randomization;stable controllers;high-fidelity simulators;neural network policy;ATRIAS robot;bipedal robots","","8","","24","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, analytically specifying useful object transition maps, or hand-object Jacobians, for scenarios in which there is uncertainty in some key aspect of the hand-object system is difficult or impossible. This could be in scenarios with standard fully-actuated hands where, for instance, there is not an accurate model of the contact conditions, or in scenarios with fewer control inputs than mechanical degrees of freedom (such as underactuated hands or those that are controlled by synergies or impedance controlled frameworks), since the output space is of higher dimension than the input space. In this work, we develop a method for extracting object transition maps by tracking the state of the grasp frame. We begin by modeling a compliant, underactuated hand and its mechanical properties through an energy-based approach. From this energy model, we provide controlled actuation inputs to change the state of the grasp frame. We observe the response from these actions and develop a regression map of the action-reaction pairs, where the map is subject to our intent for grasp frame movement and the regional relationship between the contacts. Once the regression model is developed, we perform within-hand planning of the grasp frame with newly introduced objects. This approach is agnostic to the global geometry of the object and is able to adapt when undesirable contact conditions, such as sliding, occur. The learning-based methodology estimates the non-linearities representative in the properties of the system. We test our framework physically on an adapted Yale Openhand Model O. By transferring the learned model from simulation to the physical hand without adaptation, we show that this energy modeling approach is robust to inaccuracies in parameter estimation. We demonstrate its efficacy in a handwriting task.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968458","","","actuators;dexterous manipulators;geometry;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation;regression analysis","data-driven framework;dexterous manipulation;unknown objects;quasistatic control strategies;fingertip manipulation;robot hands;hand-object Jacobians;hand-object system;fully-actuated hands;control inputs;mechanical degrees;underactuated hands;impedance controlled frameworks;output space;compliant hand;underactuated hand;mechanical properties;energy-based approach;energy model;actuation inputs;regression map;action-reaction pairs;grasp frame movement;regression model;within-hand planning;undesirable contact conditions;learning-based methodology;adapted Yale Openhand Model O;physical hand;energy modeling approach;object transition maps","","1","","23","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This controller uses the state space equations that consider the rotor current and voltage as state and control variables, to execute the predictive control action. Therefore, the model of the plant must be transformed into two discrete transference functions, by means of an auto-regressive moving average model, in order to attain a discrete and decoupled controller, which makes it possible to treat it as two independent single-input single-output systems instead of a magnetic coupled multiple-input multiple-output system. For achieving that, a direct power control strategy is used, based on the past and future rotor currents and voltages estimation. The algorithm evaluates the rotor current predictors for a defined prediction horizon and computes the new rotor voltages that must be injected to controlling the stator active and reactive powers. To evaluate the controller performance, some simulations were made using Matlab/Simulink. Experimental tests were carried out with a small-scale prototype assuming normal operating conditions with constant and variable wind speed profiles. Finally, some conclusions respect to the dynamic performance of this new controller are summarized.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2019.1911699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823580","","Rotors;Doubly fed induction generators;Stators;Mathematical model;Predictive control;Prediction algorithms;Wind energy","asynchronous generators;autoregressive moving average processes;power control;power generation control;predictive control;rotors;stators;transfer functions;wind power plants","predictive controller;synchronous reference frame;wind energy system;induction generator;state space equations;control variables;predictive control action;discrete transference functions;discrete controller;decoupled controller;independent single-input single-output systems;multiple-input multiple-output system;direct power control strategy;voltages estimation;rotor current predictors;rotor voltages;controller performance;prediction horizon;wind speed profiles;long-range generalized predictive control algorithm","","2","","","","3 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An arc furnace transformer is at a monophonic risk of failure due to the action of different stresses. Reliability is a decisive performance index to ensure that a component will perform the desired function at the coveted time. In this research, beginning with the development of a combined fault tree for arc furnace transformers, a straightforward and conceivable software model is developed to assess reliability. The model incorporates MATLAB Simulink and Fuzzy toolbox for reliability computation and assigning a fuzzified reliability level. Subsequently, reliability indices like availability, unavailability, etc. are computed. Finally, the model is implemented for electric arc furnace transformers installed in different locations of India. This research will be helpful for utilities and researchers associated with enhancing the reliability and availability of the transformer.","","978-1-7281-5070-3","10.1109/GUCON48875.2020.9231147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9231147","Electric Arc Furnace (EAF);Failure Mode (FM);Reliability Block Diagram (RBD), etc","Software packages;Computational modeling;Furnaces;Software reliability;Mathematical model;Stress;Matlab","arc furnaces;fault trees;fuzzy set theory;Matlab;power engineering computing;power transformers;reliability","reliability modelling;electric arc furnace transformers;strikingly reliable power transfer devices;electric arc furnaces;arc furnace transformer;decisive performance index;straightforward software model;conceivable software model;reliability computation;fuzzified reliability level;reliability indices","","","","17","","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a design framework is presented that does not rely on passivity considerations. A number of results are given that deal with stability and transparency properties of the tele-rehabilitation system in the case of intrinsically non-passive behaviour of the therapist. In particular, a stabilization scheme for the networked tele-rehabilitation system is proposed which guarantees stability regardless of the specific actions of the therapist. Simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical developments.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-1736-8","10.1109/IROS.2012.6386152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386152","","Stability analysis;Medical treatment;Transfer functions;Delay;Humans;Force;Teleoperators","patient rehabilitation;stability;telemedicine;telerobotics","nonpassive environment;master-slave teleoperator systems;assistive actions;assistive therapy;passivity considerations;tele-rehabilitation system stability;tele-rehabilitation system transparency;intrinsically nonpassive behaviour;therapist;networked tele-rehabilitation system","","27","","15","","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

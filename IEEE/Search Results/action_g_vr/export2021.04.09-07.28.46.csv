The fuzzy CMAC network topological architecture is described. First, the continuous states of the system are partitioned into a number of fuzzy boxes. Second, the proposed fuzzy CMAC evaluates the Q-values of agents in the fired fuzzy boxes and chooses control actions with maximum Q-values. Then a critic generates an external reinforcement signal according to the outcome or the effect of the control at every time-step, which is used later for further improving the estimation of these Q-values. To speed up the convergence of reinforcement learning, the traditional PID controller with several groups of different parameters is adopted so as to collect a number of taught-lessons. These taught-lessons together with the experienced lessons generated automatically, are sequentially replayed and learned, respectively, under the guidance of different reinforcement mechanisms. The hybrid adaptive and learning control system is applied to the control of a pH-neutralization process. Simulation investigations show that the fuzzy connectionist Q-learning control system has more adaptive, higher intelligence, and stronger generalization ability compared to neural network or fuzzy neural network control techniques using supervised learning.","","0-7803-4253-4","10.1109/ICIPS.1997.672805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=672805","","Neural networks;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy neural networks;Automatic control;Fuzzy systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Control systems;Partitioning algorithms;Signal generators","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neurocontrollers;intelligent control;fuzzy control;fuzzy neural nets;neural net architecture;software agents;pH control;simulation;adaptive systems;generalisation (artificial intelligence)","dynamic neural network control;fuzzy Q-learning algorithms;efficient Q-learning paradigm;fuzzy CMAC network;topological architecture;continuous states;fuzzy boxes;agents;control actions;maximum Q-values;external reinforcement signal;reinforcement learning;convergence;PID controller;taught lesson;hybrid adaptive/learning control system;pH neutralization process control;simulation;fuzzy connectionist Q-learning control system;intelligence;adaptive ability;generalization ability","","3","","17","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The terrain where all the action takes place, is perceived to be on the table or floor in player's room.

We describe a study investigating the effect of a co-located cooperative locomotion interface on virtual distance perception.

To demonstrate this framework, we simulate a probabilistic spiking neuron with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and estimate all model parameters from the simulated spiking data. In the neuron model, output spiking activity is generated by the combination of noise, feedback from the output, and an input-feedforward component whose magnitude is modulated by synaptic weight. The synaptic weight is calculated with STDP with the following features: (1) weight change based on the relative timing of input-output spike pairs, (2) prolonged plasticity induction, and (3) considerations for system stability. Estimation of all model parameters is achieved iteratively by formulating the model as a generalized linear model with Volterra kernels and basis function expansion. Successful estimation of all model parameters in this study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for in-vivo experimental studies. Furthermore, the consideration of system stability and prolonged plasticity induction enhances the ability to capture how STDP affects a neural population's signal transformation properties over a realistic time course. Plasticity characterization with this estimation method could yield insights into functional implications of STDP and be incorporated into a cortical prosthesis.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945137","","Estimation;Kernel;Neurons;Feedforward neural networks;Timing;Stability analysis;Data models","iterative methods;medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;probability;prosthetics;Volterra equations","cortical prosthesis;estimation method;generalized linear model;signal transformation properties;neural populations;input-output spike pairs;synaptic weight;input-feedforward component;output spiking activity;neuron model;simulated spiking data;model parameters;probabilistic spiking neuron;behaviorally recorded spiking events;activity-dependent plasticity;spike-timing-dependent plasticity;generalized Volterra kernel model identification","Action Potentials;CA3 Region, Hippocampal;Humans;Models, Neurological;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Nonlinear Dynamics","2","","14","","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our experiments show that the high variability in our new synthetic training corpus leads to good generalization to real world footage and to state of the art results on real world datasets with ground truth.

Here, a point process generalized linear model (PPGLM) was applied to infer the functional connectivity of neuronal ensembles during both baseline and anesthesia, in which neuronal firing rates and network connectivity might change dramatically. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach combined with a variational Bayes (VB) algorithm is used for statistical inference. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated with synthetic spike train data drawn from small and medium-size networks (consisting of up to 200 neurons), which are simulated using biophysical voltage-gated conductance models. We further apply the analysis to experimental spike train data recorded from rats' barrel cortex during both active behavior and isoflurane anesthesia conditions.

Experimental studies demonstrated that MUAPs are not exactly synchronized with the vibratory stimulus but show a variable latency jitter, whose effects have not been investigated yet. Synchronized action potential train was represented as a quasi-periodic sequence of a given MU waveform. The latency jitter of action potentials was modeled as a Gaussian stochastic process, in accordance to the previous experimental studies. A mathematical expression for power spectrum of a synchronized MUAPT has been derived. The spectrum comprises a significant continuous component and discrete components at the vibratory frequency and its harmonics. Their relevance is correlated to the level of synchronization: the weaker the synchronization the more relevant is the continuous spectrum. Electromyography (EMG) rectification enhances the discrete components. The derived equations have general validity and well describe the power spectrum of actual EMG recordings during vibratory stimulation. Results are obtained by appropriately setting the level of synchronization and vibration frequency. This paper definitively clarifies the nature of changes in spectrum of raw EMG recordings from muscles undergoing vibratory stimulation. Results confirm the need of motion artifact filtering for raw EMG recordings during stimulation and strongly suggest to avoid EMG rectification that significantly alters the spectrum characteristics.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2803019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8283538","Electromyography spectrum;motion artifact;motor unit action potential train;whole body vibration","Vibrations;Synchronization;Electromyography;Muscles;Action potentials;Jitter;Mathematical model","bioelectric potentials;biomechanics;electromyography;filtering theory;Gaussian processes;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;stochastic processes;vibrations","power spectrum;motor unit action potential train;mechanical vibration;mechanical vibratory stimulation;detailed formulation;concise mathematical formulation;vibratory stimulus;variable latency jitter;synchronized action potential train;action potentials;synchronized MUAPT;significant continuous component;discrete components;vibratory frequency;synchronization;continuous spectrum;raw EMG recordings;spectrum characteristics;MUAPT;quasiperiodic sequence;latency jitter;Gaussian stochastic process;harmonics;motion artifact filtering","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electromyography;Humans;Motor Neurons;Muscle Contraction;Muscle Fibers, Skeletal;Normal Distribution;Physical Stimulation;Reproducibility of Results;Stochastic Processes;Vibration","1","","43","","6 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We asked users to indicate whether or not they believed that they could step across the virtual gaps given their widths and depths. Averaging across changes in width and depth, users generally underestimated their abilities to cross gaps. However, this underestimation was significantly greater when the gaps were deep. Thus, our findings suggest that users in augmented reality respond with more conservative judgments when presented with risky stimuli-a response that mimics real world behavior.

The model contains several linear as well as nonlinear subsystems, which have been reported to model the physiological processes involved. The model produces under steady state conditions, with no neural activity, AP sequences with intervals of about 360 ms. Under step increases of either (NE) or (ACh), nonlinear cycle length changes occur-some 30% decrease from control for sympathetic activity, and some 81% increase for parasympathetic activity.

The proposed methodology takes advantage of generalized stochastic Petri nets with rewards (GSPNR) to model multi-robot problems. A GSPNR allows for unified modeling of action selection, uncertainty on the duration of action execution, and for goal specification through the use of transition rewards and rewards per time unit. Our approach relies on the interpretation of the GSPNR model as an equivalent embedded Markov reward automaton (MRA).

On the other hand, the generation of the training content to be transferred via AR is a comprehensive problem that is addressed in this paper. Thus, this paper tries to describe the whole chain of implementations and general aspects involved in the creation of AR training applications, including examples for used multimodal devices. This chain starts with the capturing of expert actions to be hold in the ""digital representation of skill"". The digital representation of skill is transferred to the training protocol that specifies the storyboard of the AR training session.

The model should be able to capture the nonlinear dynamical properties of various types of neurons and the nonstationary properties such as the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In this paper, we propose a generalized Laguerre-Volterra modeling approach for such a task. Due to its built-in nonlinear dynamical terms, the generalized Laguerre-Volterra model (GLVM) can capture various biological processes/mechanisms. Using Laguerre expansion of Volterra kernel technique, the model is fully represented with a small set of coefficients. The calculation of the model variables can be expressed recursively based on only the current and the one-step-before values and thus can be performed efficiently. In addition, we show that, using the same methodology, STDP can be implemented as a specific form of second-order Volterra kernel describing the causal relationship between pairs of input-output spikes and the changes of the feedforward kernels in the GLVMs.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6943690","","Neurons;Biological system modeling;Kernel;Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Biological processes","brain models;cognition;neural nets;neurophysiology;nonlinear dynamical systems;Volterra equations","spiking neuron model;spike-timing-dependent plasticity;large-scale simulations;brain;biologically-inspired cognitive architectures;succinct model;flexible model;nonlinear dynamical properties;nonstationary properties;STDP;generalized Laguerre-Volterra modeling;built-in nonlinear dynamical terms;GLVM;biological processes/mechanisms;Laguerre expansion;Volterra kernel technique;model variables;one-step-before values;second-order Volterra kernel;causal relationship;input-output spikes;feedforward kernels","Action Potentials;Models, Neurological;Neurons;Nonlinear Dynamics","3","","7","","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main goal of this study is to explore the way two persons regulate their actions when performing a cooperative task of ball interception, and how interference between them may occur. Starting face to face, twenty-four participants (twelve teams of two) had to physically intercept balls moving down from the roof to the floor in a virtual room. To this end, they controlled a virtual paddle attached to their hand moving along the anterior-posterior axis, and were not allowed to communicate. Results globally showed participants were often able to intercept balls without collision by dividing the interception space in two equivalent parts. However, an area of uncertainty (where many trials were not intercepted) appeared in the center of the scene highlighting the presence of interference between participants. The width of this area increased when situation became more complex and when less information was available. Moreover, participants often interpreted balls starting above them as balls they should intercept, even when these balls were in fine intercepted by their partner. Overall, results showed that team coordination emerges from between-participants interactions in this ball interception task and that interference between them depends on task complexity (uncertainty on partner's action and visual information available).","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8797967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8797967","Virtual reality;Collaborative interactions;Ball interception;Perception-action;Team interference","Task analysis;Interference;Uncertainty;Visualization;Sports;Complexity theory;Collaboration","groupware;multi-robot systems;virtual reality","virtual room;virtual paddle;anterior-posterior axis;interception space;team coordination;between-participants interactions;ball interception task;task complexity;face-to-face cooperative interception","","","","5","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of the proposed control is defined in relation with the trade-off between the wind energy conversion maximization and the minimization of the stress on the drive train shafts. Sliding mode control approach (SMC) emerges as an especially suitable option to deal with variable speed wind turbine. However, for large uncertain systems, the SMC produces chattering problems due to the higher needed switching gain. In order to reduce this gain, general regression neural network (GRNN) is used for the prediction of model unknown component and hence enable a lower switching gain to be used. In the present work, back-propagation (BP) algorithm will be used to train online the GRNN weights. A robust control term with low switching gain is added to compensate the neural network errors. The stability is shown by the Lyapunov theory and the control action used did not exhibit any chattering behavior. The effectiveness of the designed method is illustrated in simulations by the comparison with traditional SMC.","","978-1-4799-7511-2","10.1109/ISACV.2015.7106174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106174","variable speed wind turbine;sliding mode control;general regression neural network","Wind turbines;Neural networks;Uncertainty;Switches;Rotors;Training","backpropagation;control system synthesis;neurocontrollers;power generation control;regression analysis;robust control;uncertain systems;variable structure systems;wind power plants;wind turbines","robust intelligent control;variable speed wind turbine;general regression neural network sliding mode controller design;GRNNSM controller;energy conversion maximization;stress minimization;drive train shafts;SMC;uncertain systems;chattering problems;switching gain;backpropagation algorithm;BP algorithm;Lyapunov theory","","2","","15","","14 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All actions in simulators are generated by a precise set of rules which determine the correct feedback stimuli to be presented to the operator. In the article, haptic interfaces are presented as stand alone systems having their own and independent control. Consequently we explore the control capabilities and we identify a new extended interaction paradigm which provides to the machine the capability of interpreting the human actions and organizing a new high level feedback.

This block has a rapid onset and reversal. The mechanism of electrical nerve conduction block has not been conclusively determined, and inconsistencies appear in the literature regarding whether the block is produced by membrane hyperpolarization, depolarization, or through some other means. We have used simulations in a nerve membrane model, coupled with in vivo experiments, to identify the mechanism and principles of electrical conduction block. A nerve simulation package (Neuron) was used to model direct current (dc) block in squid, frog, and mammalian neuron models. A frog sciatic nerve/gastrocnemius preparation was used to examine nerve conduction block in vivo. Both simulations and experiments confirm that depolarization block requires less current than hyperpolarization block. Dynamic simulations suggest that block can occur under both the real physical electrode as well as adjacent virtual electrode sites. A hypothesis is presented which formulates the likely types of dc block and the possible block current requirements.

Visualization of the simulations is crucial to observe and study the dynamics of the SNN, because these models involve high level of biological realism by encoding spatial-temporal information into action potentials or spikes like biological neurons do. Existing tools are based on supercomputers or customized neuromorphic architectures to compute large-scale SNN models. However, many of them are unsuitable to carry out real-time analysis of large scale SNN with minimal cost as large amount of complex data needs to be processed and displayed at the same time. This work intends to provide an efficient cost effective and power efficient emulation tool based on hardware-software hybrid to process, control, and display large-scale SNN network behavior in real time. The solution consists of a customized hardware architecture that computes the neural-synaptic parameters and a software environment that displays the same on the screen of a general purpose computer (Host). The data to be visualized is transferred to the host through high speed Ethernet link. The proposed solution tailors the use of the Ethernet link bandwidth to an optimum such that the customized neuromorphic architecture and the host computer duo can be used to visualize the dynamics of SNN network of any size in real-time. The hardware and software platforms are scalable in terms of number of neurons and synapses. This solution gives flexibility to the user to visualize and analyze SNN network of any size avoiding saturation of the high-speed serial Ethernet link while supporting the visualization of SNN dynamics with a good screen resolution.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2018.8408450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8408450","embedded systems;FPGA;G-Ethernet;Neuromorphic systems;Spiking Neural Networks","Visualization;Field programmable gate arrays;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Random access memory;Real-time systems;Software","embedded systems;local area networks;neural net architecture;neurophysiology","NeuroSpike viewer;graphical environment;large-scale Spiking Neural Networks;SNN dynamics;high-speed serial Ethernet link;software platforms;host computer duo;customized neuromorphic architecture;Ethernet link bandwidth;high speed Ethernet link;general purpose computer;software environment;neural-synaptic parameters;customized hardware architecture;large-scale SNN network behavior;hardware-software hybrid;power efficient emulation tool;real-time analysis;large-scale SNN models;neuromorphic architectures;biological neurons;action potentials;spatial-temporal information;biological realism;embedded systems;real-time simulation","","","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The responses of such devices are characterized as functions of several parameters, e.g. sealing impedance, density of ionic currents in the cell membrane, and spatial discontinuities of the adhesion process. It is shown that the various signal shapes reported in the literature can be reproduced and interpreted in terms of time derivatives of the action potential.

However, to use it effectively, a good prediction of the user's future actions is crucial. Traditionally, this prediction is made based on the user's position or current direction of movement. In the area of cognitive sciences however, it was shown that a person's gaze can also be highly indicative of his intention in both selection and navigation tasks. In this paper, this effect is used the first time to predict a user's locomotion target during goal-directed locomotion in an immersive virtual environment. After discussing the general implications and challenges of using eye tracking for prediction in a locomotion context, we propose a prediction method for a user's intended locomotion target. This approach is then compared with position based approaches in terms of prediction time and accuracy based on data gathered in an experiment. The results show that, in certain situations, eye tracking allows an earlier prediction compared approaches currently used for redirected walking. However, other recently published prediction methods that are based on the user's position perform almost as well as the eye tracking based approaches presented in this paper.","","978-1-5090-0842-1","10.1109/3DUI.2016.7460030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460030","Tracking;locomotion;eye tracking;prediction;redirected walking;virtual reality","Legged locomotion;Gaze tracking;Virtual environments;Context;Navigation;Predictive control","ergonomics;virtual reality","eye tracking;locomotion prediction;redirected walking;model predictive control;redirection techniques;user action prediction;cognitive sciences;user intention;user selection task;user navigation task;position based approach","","7","","31","","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual Reality has demonstrated advantages applied to Education, providing immersive experiences and new ways of visualization and interaction. However, this technology has not been extensively explored in Software Engineering. In this sense, this paper aims to present a disruptive method of teaching and learning support on fundamentals in object orientation paradigm based on Immersive Learning, called OO Game VR. In addition, an initial heuristic evaluation was performed with 6 subjects in order to identify usability problems. Despite problems found related to support learning, navigation and orientation, the natural expression of action and clear entry and exit points, the subjects were able to perform all the tasks, showing indications that the application has the potential to support teaching of OOP teaching through Immersive Learning.

It follows that one could measure the degree of misperception an individual experiences and generate some manipulation to correct for it, though it is not clear that correct behavior in a specific blind directed action task leads to correct behavior in all tasks in general. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of correcting perceived distance in virtual reality by first measuring individual perceived distance through blind throwing, then manipulating sense of space using a vertex shader to make things appear more or less distant, to a degree personalized to the individual's perceived distance. Two variants of the manipulation are explored. The effects of these personalized manipulations are first evaluated when performing the same blind throwing task used to calibrate the manipulation. Then, in order to observe the effects of the manipulation on dissimilar tasks, participants perform two perceptual matching tasks which allow full visual feedback as objects, or the participants themselves, move through space.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8797911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8797911","I.3.7 [Computing Methodologies]: Graphics Utilities—Virtual reality","Task analysis;Virtual environments;Measurement uncertainty;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Rendering (computer graphics)","rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","performing blind directed-action tasks;specific blind directed action task;perceived distance;virtual reality;personalized manipulations;blind throwing task;dissimilar tasks;perceptual matching tasks;personalized rendering manipulation","","","","19","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further the fundamental philosophy of new created application is clarified and the process called visual scripting is described, which was used for development of new application. It also provides more detailed view on particular logical sections. In these sections necessary data are harvested and compared with values from relevant virtual arrays.

Positioning device can determine and set the position of basic working plane using the commands from computer interface or manual changes. Key information about exact position of individual composite layers are obtained in real time thanks to the built-in sensors. One of them manages the data change of the desk position (X, Y, Z), other checks the rotation around main axis situated in the center of the table.

We assume that the stimulus intensity is primarily a linear combination of the spontaneous firing rate, the muscle extension, and the stretch velocity. By using the ability of the point process framework to provide an objective goodness of fit analysis, we were able to distinguish two classes of spike clusters with different statistical structure. We found that spike clusters with higher SNR have a temporal structure that can be fitted by an inverse Gaussian distribution while lower SNR clusters follow a Poisson-like distribution. The point process algorithm is further able to provide the instantaneous intensity function associated with the stimulus-response model with the best goodness of fit.

However, this feedback depends on material properties and user interactions in a complex, non-linear manner. Therefore, it is challenging to model the mapping from material and user interactions to haptic feedback in a way that generalizes over many variations of the user's input. Current methodologies are typically conditioned on user interactions, but require a separate model for each material. In this paper, we present a learned action-conditional model that uses data from a vision-based tactile sensor (GelSight) and user's action as input. This model predicts an induced acceleration that could be used to provide haptic vibration feedback to a user. We trained our proposed model on a publicly available dataset (Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit) that we augmented with GelSight measurements of the different materials. We show that a unified model over all materials outperforms previous methods and generalizes to new actions and new instances of the material categories in the dataset.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197447","","Haptic interfaces;Autoregressive processes;Force;Acceleration;Predictive models;Solid modeling;Discrete Fourier transforms","feedback;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;robot vision;tactile sensors;telerobotics;virtual reality","Haptic Texture generation;haptic sensory feedback;user interactions;immersive virtual reality;material properties;haptic vibration feedback;Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit;action-conditional model learning;GelSight measurements;teleoperation system;autonomous robot;GelSight image texture","","","","33","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The driving input contains receptive field properties that must be transmitted while the modulating input alters the specifics of transmission. Relay reliability of a relay cell is defined as the fraction of pulses in the driving input that generate action potentials at the neuron's output, and is in general a complicated function of the driving input, the modulating input and the cell's properties. In a recent study, we computed analytic bounds on the reliability of relay neurons for a class of Poisson driving inputs and sinusoidal modulating inputs. Here, we generalize our analysis and compute bounds on the relay reliability for any modulating input. Furthermore, we show that if the modulating input is generated by a colored Gaussian process, closed form expressions for bounds on relay reliability can be derived. We applied our analysis to investigate relay reliability of thalamic cells in health and in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is hypothesized that in health, neurons in the motor thalamus relay information only when needed and this capability is compromised in PD due to exaggerated beta-band oscillations in the modulating input from the basal ganglia (BG). To test this hypothesis, we used modulating and driving inputs simulated from a detailed computational model of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical motor loop and computed our theoretical bounds in both PD and healthy conditions. Our bounds match well with our empirically computed reliability and show that the relay reliability is larger in the healthy condition across the population of thalamic neurons. Furthermore, we show that the increase in power in the beta-band of the modulating input (output of BG) is causally related with the decrease in relay reliability in the PD condition.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945134","","Relays;Neurons;Reliability theory;Computational modeling;Sociology;Statistics","brain models;cellular biophysics;diseases;neurophysiology","cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical motor loop;computational model;basal ganglia;exaggerated beta-band oscillations;health;thalamic cells;closed form expressions;colored Gaussian process;relay reliability;analytic bounds;action potentials;pulse fraction;modulating input;driving input;sensory systems;relay cells;Parkinson's disease application;relay neurons;performance limitations","Action Potentials;Animals;Basal Ganglia;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Cortex;Neurons;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Thalamus","1","","14","","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A significant body of research has demonstrated how perception and action work in such environments, but most of this work has been done studying adults. Less is known about how physical and cognitive development affect perception and action in IVEs, particularly as applied to preteen and teenage children. Accordingly, in the current study we assess how preteens (children aged 8-12 years) and teenagers (children aged 15-18 years) respond to mismatches between their motor behavior and the visual information presented by an IVE. Over two experiments, we evaluate how these individuals recalibrate their actions across functionally distinct systems of movement. The first experiment analyzed forward walking recalibration after exposure to an IVE with either increased or decreased visual flow. Visual flow during normal bipedal locomotion was manipulated to be either twice or half as fast as the physical gait. The second experiment leveraged a prism throwing adaptation paradigm to test the effect of recalibration on throwing movement. In the first experiment, our results show no differences across age groups, although subjects generally experienced a post-exposure effect of shortened distance estimation after experiencing visually faster flow and longer distance estimation after experiencing visually slower flow. In the second experiment, subjects generally showed the typical prism adaptation behavior of a throwing after-effect error. The error lasted longer for preteens than older children. Our results have implications for the design of virtual systems with children as a target audience.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794072","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267487","Virtual environments;perceptual-motor recalibration;perception;children","Legged locomotion;Visualization;Virtual environments;Biomechanics;Calibration;Electronic mail","gait analysis;virtual reality;visual perception","teenage children;visual information;normal bipedal locomotion;physical gait;adaptation paradigm;throwing movement;post-exposure effect;visually faster flow;visually slower flow;throwing after-effect error;virtual systems;locomotive recalibration;immersive virtual environments;action work;physical development;cognitive development;visual flow;virtual reality;prism adaptation behavior;time 8 year to 12 year;time 15 year to 18 year","Adaptation, Physiological;Adolescent;Child;Female;Humans;Male;Perception;Psychomotor Performance;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Walking","","","81","Traditional","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the algorithm for extracting the different scales is not well adapted to nonlinear/nonstationary signals. In this letter, we introduce adaptive multiscale entropy (AME) measures in which the scales are adaptively derived directly from the data by virtue of recently developed multivariate empirical mode decomposition. Depending on the consecutive removal of low-frequency or high-frequency components, our AME can be estimated at either coarse-to-fine or fine-to-coarse scales over which the sample entropy is performed. Computer simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of AME for analysis of the highly nonstationary data.

Work is defined formally here as purposeful activity acting on, and responding to, the environment as required by the situation. This work is performed by a team of automated and human agents, and involves both cognitive and physical activity. At its most atomic, work may be represented as actions that evaluate the current situation, and then act on the environment, as well as `teamwork' actions and `decision actions' whereby agents evaluate the situation to select the appropriate sets of actions (i.e. strategies). Work is thus a response to the situation, with strategies chosen in response to the physical environment, the allocation of responsibility within the team; and agent status including expertise, the demands on the agent, and resources available to the agent such as time and information. In addition, a description of the structures inherent to work is also used to organize the actions into an abstraction hierarchy: at the bottom are the resources and actions, but at higher levels of abstraction more aggregate functions provide descriptions that relate the detailed actions to the specific goals of the work. Historically, such models have been used qualitatively, but had a disconnect from computational modeling of situated behavior. Therefore, this paper details how they may be dynamically simulated to examine how work can be studied dynamically as situated within a dynamic environment driving, and responding to, agent activity.","2379-1675","978-1-61284-786-3","10.1109/COGSIMA.2011.5753756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753756","","Computational modeling;Teamwork;Atmospheric modeling;Resource management;Aircraft;Dynamic scheduling","cognition;decision making;multi-agent systems;team working","heterogeneous dynamic system;situated work simulation;computer agent;human agent;cognitive activity;physical activity;teamwork action;decision action;agent status","","9","","18","","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Building upon this taxonomy, we selected three representative tasks from the taxonomy to evaluate in a virtual reality simulation. We conducted a series of human subject experiments to compare user performance and preference on a disassembly task with and without haptic feedback using CyberGlove, Phantom, and SpaceMouse interfaces. Analysis of the simulation runs shows Phantom users learned to accomplish the simulated actions significantly more quickly than did users of the CyberGlove or the SpaceMouse. Moreover, a lack of differences in the post-experiment questionnaire suggests that haptics research should include a measure of actual performance speed or accuracy rather than relying solely on subjective reports of a device's ease of use.","1087-8270","0-7695-1882-6","10.1109/VR.2003.1191143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191143","","Taxonomy;Haptic interfaces;Data gloves;Imaging phantoms;Analytical models;Torque;Virtual reality;Humans;Feedback;Velocity measurement","haptic interfaces;virtual reality;digital simulation;assembling","haptic actions;disassembly tasks;haptic simulations;virtual reality simulation;human subject experiments;user performance;disassembly task;haptic feedback;CyberGlove;Phantom;SpaceMouse interfaces;simulation runs;simulated actions;haptics research","","17","","14","","2 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, a DVE system is a distributed system which allows many clients who are located in different parts of the network to concurrently explore and interact with each other under a high resolution, 3D, graphical virtual environment. Each client in a DVE system is represented by an avatar in the virtual environment, and each avatar can move and interact freely in the virtual environment. There are many challenging issues in designing a cost-effective DVE system. The article addresses two important design issues, namely: 1) how to construct a communication subgraph which can efficiently carry traffic generated by all clients in a DVE system, and 2) how to guarantee that each participating client has the same consistent view of the virtual world. In other words, if there is an action taken by an avatar or if there is any change in the state of an object in the virtual world, every participating client will be able to view the change. To provide this consistent view, a DVE system needs to perform synchronization actions periodically, We present several algorithms for constructing a communication subgraph. In the subgraph construction, we try to reduce the consumption of network bandwidth resources or reduce the maximum delay between any two clients in a DVE system. Based on a given communication subgraph, we then derive the optimal synchronization interval so as to guarantee the view consistency among all participating clients. The derivation of the optimal synchronization interval is based on the theory of Markov chains and the fundamental matrix.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.956100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=956100","","Virtual environment;Avatars;Bandwidth;Computer graphics;Multimedia systems;High-speed networks;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Data mining","virtual reality;graph theory;Markov processes;synchronisation;optimisation;client-server systems;computer graphics","communication subgraphs;optimal synchronization interval;distributed virtual environment systems;high resolution 3D graphical virtual environment;DVE system;avatar;design issues;participating client;consistent view;synchronization actions;subgraph construction;network bandwidth resources;view consistency;Markov chains;fundamental matrix","","18","","15","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Natural interaction means human actions in the real world with other humans and/or with real world objects. Guided by the basic constraints of natural interaction, we derive a set of recommendations for the next generation of user interfaces: the natural user interface (NUI).

In this pathological condition of the cochlea, type-1 spiral ganglion neurons in Rosenthal's canal play a vital role in the action potential initiation. Various morphological studies of the human temporal bones suggest that the spiral ganglion neurons are surrounded by heterogeneous structures formed by a variety of cells and tissues. However, the existing simulation models have not considered the tissue heterogeneity in the Rosenthal's canal while studying the electric field interaction with spiral ganglion neurons. Unlike the existing models, we have implemented the tissue heterogeneity in the Rosenthal's canal using a computationally inexpensive image based method in a two-dimensional finite element model. Our simulation results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of surrounding tissues influences the electric field distribution in the Rosenthal's canal, and thereby alters the transmembrane potential of the spiral ganglion neurons. In addition to the academic interest, these results are especially useful to understand how the latest tissue regeneration methods such as gene therapy and drug-induced resprouting of peripheral axons, which probably modify the density of the tissues in the Rosenthal's canal, affect the cochlear implant functionality.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2700361","German Science Foundation (DFG); Research Training Group GRK; Analyse und Simulation elektrischer Wechselwirkungen zwischen Implantaten und Biosystemen; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938671","Cochlear implants;finite element analysis;glial cells;spiral ganglion neurons;tissue heterogeneity","Irrigation;Computational modeling;Conductivity;Spirals;Cells (biology);Neurons;Cochlear implants","auditory evoked potentials;biological tissues;biomembranes;cellular biophysics;cochlear implants;finite element analysis;medical disorders;neurophysiology","tissue heterogeneity;transmembrane potential;type-1 spiral ganglion neurons;electric stimulation;auditory nerve;clinical intervention;sensory neural deafness treatment;pathological condition;Rosenthal's canal;action potential initiation;morphological studies;human temporal bones;heterogeneous structures;cell variety;tissue variety;computationally inexpensive image based method;two-dimensional finite element model;electric field distribution;gene therapy;drug-induced resprouting;peripheral axons;cochlear implant functionality","Cochlear Implants;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Membrane Potentials;Models, Neurological;Neuroglia;Neurons;Spiral Ganglion","1","","95","","5 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we go a step further by proposing a framework in which the movements of a person are translated into actions in a virtual world. This allows a user to walk around freely while wearing an HMD, increasing the reality of the virtual experience. We will focus in detail on the challenges related to the localization of the user and discuss different options like existing wireless localization technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and an object recognition algorithm. The latter is used in the final solution. Furthermore, we present an experimental and mobile setup to use an HMD in a portable manner.

To accomplish this, we generalize the two-dimensional parallel-coordinates statistical graphic as an immersive ""parallel-planes"" visualization for multivariate time series emitted by simulations running in parallel with the visualization. In contrast to traditional parallel coordinate's mapping the multivariate dimensions onto coordinate axes represented by a series of parallel lines, we map pairs of the multivariate dimensions onto a series of parallel rectangles. As in the case of parallel coordinates, each individual observation in the dataset is mapped to a polyline whose vertices coincide with its coordinate values. Regions of the rectangles can be ""brushed"" to highlight and select observations of interest: a ""slider"" control allows the user to filter the observations by their time coordinate. In an immersive virtual environment, users interact with the parallel planes using a joystick that can select regions on the planes, manipulate selection, and filter time. The brushing and selection actions are used to both explore existing data as well as to launch additional simulations corresponding to the visually selected portions of the input parameter space. As soon as the new simulations complete, their resulting observations are displayed in the virtual environment.

It is closely linked to automated aspects of sensorimotor control and understood to depend on one's ability to monitor the details of one's movements. As such SoA has been argued to be a critical component of self-awareness in general and contribute to presence in virtual reality environments in particular. A common approach to investigating SoA is to ask participants to perform goal-directed movements and introducing spatial or temporal visuomotor mismatches in the feedback. Feedback movements are traditionally either switched with someone else's movements using a 2D video-feed or modified by providing abstracted feedback about one's actions on a computer screen. The aim of the current study was to quantify conscious monitoring and the SoA for ecologically valid, three dimensional feedback of the participants' actual limb and movements. This was achieved by displaying an Infra-Red (IR) feed of the participants' upper limbs in an augmented virtuality environment (AVE) using a head-mounted display (HMD). Movements could be fed back in real-time (46ms system delay) or with an experimental delay of up to 570ms. As hypothesized, participant's SoA decreased with increasing temporal visuomotor mismatches (p<;.001), replicating previous findings and extending them to AVEs. In-line with this literature, we report temporal limits of 222±60ms (50% psychometric threshold) in N=28 participants. Our results demonstrate the validity of the experimental platform by replicating studies in SoA both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In RL, the system is modeled as a Markov decision process with states, actions, rewards, and policies. A policy is learned through repeated interaction with the environment. When a RL agent cannot interact with the real system due to time and cost constraints, a simulation of the system may be used in its place. Unfortunately, most simulations are not built for the purpose of interacting with a RL agent. Simulations built to function as the environment are often structured only according to the defined state, action, and reward and can lack fidelity, detail, and accuracy. We propose a general framework for bridging the worlds of simulation and RL. This is accomplished by placing ""interpreters"" between the simulation and the RL agent that translate information into a form that is coherent to each entity.","","978-1-56555-370-5","10.22360/SpringSim.2020.AIS.001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185415","reinforcement learning;Markov decision process;manufacturing","Learning (artificial intelligence);Decoding;Encoding;Decision making;Markov processes;Manufacturing;Machine learning","control engineering computing;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes","reinforcement learning;simulated environments;encoder decoder framework;sequential decision;manufacturing systems;Markov decision process;repeated interaction;RL agent;cost constraints;defined state","","","","19","","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various factors such as asymmetrical information distribution and across-channel redundancy may, however, limit the benefit of high-dimensional signal sets, and the increased computational complexity may not yield corresponding improvement in system performance. High-dimensional system models may also lead to overfitting and lack of generalizability. To address these issues, we present a generalized modulation depth measure using the state-space framework that quantifies the tuning of a neural signal channel to relevant behavioral covariates. For a dynamical system, we develop computationally efficient procedures for estimating modulation depth from multivariate data. We show that this measure can be used to rank neural signals and select an optimal channel subset for inclusion in the neural decoding algorithm. We present a scheme for choosing the optimal subset based on model order selection criteria. We apply this method to neuronal ensemble spike-rate decoding in neural interfaces, using our framework to relate motor cortical activity with intended movement kinematics. With offline analysis of intracortical motor imagery data obtained from individuals with tetraplegia using the BrainGate neural interface, we demonstrate that our variable selection scheme is useful for identifying and ranking the most information-rich neural signals. We demonstrate that our approach offers several orders of magnitude lower complexity but virtually identical decoding performance compared to greedy search and other selection schemes. Our statistical analysis shows that the modulation depth of human motor cortical single-unit signals is well characterized by the generalized Pareto distribution. Our variable selection scheme has wide applicability in problems involving multisensor signal modeling and estimation in biomedical engineering systems.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2360393","Department of Defense; Department of Veterans Affairs; National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; Wings for Life Spinal Cord Research Foundation; Doris Duke Foundation; MGH Neurological Clinical Research Institute, and MGH Deane Institute for Integrated Research on Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke; Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911990","Brain–computer interface (BCI);brain–machine interface (BMI);feature selection;modulation depth (MD);neural decoding;neural interface;state-space model;tetraplegia;variable selection;Brain–computer interface (BCI);brain–machine interface (BMI);feature selection;modulation depth (MD);neural decoding;neural interface;state-space model;tetraplegia;variable selection","Signal to noise ratio;Covariance matrices;Input variables;Vectors;Modulation;Decoding","brain-computer interfaces;diseases;medical signal processing;modulation;neurophysiology;Pareto distribution;state-space methods","biomedical engineering system;multisensor signal modeling;Pareto distribution;single-unit signal;human motor cortical signal;statistical analysis;variable selection scheme;BrainGate neural interface;tetraplegia;intracortical motor imagery data;movement kinematics;motor cortical activity;spike-rate decoding;model order selection criteria;optimal subset;neural decoding algorithm;multivariate data;neural signal channel;high-dimensional system model;neural activity;neural interface technology;state-space models;modulation depth estimation","Action Potentials;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Humans;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Motor Cortex;Motor Neurons;Quadriplegia;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","10","","40","","26 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The virtual character will have perceptions, feel and express emotions and respond to different situations. To make the simulation realistic, we used a method allowing the virtual characters to execute tasks, perceive events and display emotions in a parallel way. To do that, we used the multiple resources model [1] to control the attention and to predict when two or more actions can be executed at the same time. The used emotional model is based on Scherer's theory [2].

The method measures the user's perception of the location of an ultrasound-imaged target independently from assessing the action employed to reach it. Three experiments were conducted with the sonic flashlight (SF), an RTTR device, and CUS. The first two experiments determined subjects' perception of target location with a triangulation-by-pointing task. Depth perception with the SF was comparable to direct vision, while CUS caused considerable underestimation of target depth. Binocular depth information in the SF was shown to significantly contribute to its superiority. The third experiment tested subjects in an ultrasound-guided needle insertion task. Because the SF provides visualization of the target at its actual location, subjects performed insertions faster and more accurately by using the SF rather than CUS. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed that insertions with the SF generally went directly to the target along the desired path, while CUS often led to a large deviation from the correct path consistent with the observed underestimation of target depth. These findings lend great promise to the use of RTTR-based imaging in clinical practice and provide precise means of assessing efficacy.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512019","Index Terms- Psychology;evaluation/methodology;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;image display;medical information systems;real time.","Psychology;Ultrasonic imaging;Visualization;Ultrasonography;Tomography;Acoustic reflection;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Testing;Needles;Trajectory","psychology;augmented reality;data visualisation;ultrasonic imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;real-time systems","psychophysical evaluation;in-situ ultrasound visualization;artificial reality;augmented reality;virtual reality;image display;medical information system;, real time system;ultrasonography;real-time tomographic reflection;conventional ultrasound;sonic flashlight;triangulation-by-pointing task;binocular depth information;trajectory analysis;RTTR-based imaging;clinical practice","Biopsy, Needle;Catheterization;Computer Simulation;Environment;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Male;Models, Biological;Psychomotor Performance;Ultrasonography;User-Computer Interface","19","1","25","","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motion of animal flocks has been studied, but seldom human crowds. We are concerned with modeling and generation of a crowd in a 3D virtual city to increase reality. Virtual cities often have few inhabitants, and those are controlled by the users or only repeat behavior based on strict rules. For a more natural atmosphere, many data and rules are needed. A general view of a crowd reveals significant characteristics. Though the behavior of each figure is independent, the crowd, as a huge mass of it, has a pattern as a whole. Chaos is very convenient to represent such features. It is controlled by a few parameters. For instance, since chaos is influenced quite sensitively by initial value, it can produce various nonmutual values that decide the next actions of the figures. Moreover, these values form themselves into an attractor. As the attractor is transformed by changing a parameter, we can easily control the shape of the crowd. Although random numbers are often applied to such purposes, it is difficult to create and control such patterns. Utilizing these characteristics of chaos, we constructed the models of the crowd in the street and the folk dance. The prototype system was developed for evaluation and it was confirmed that users felt easy to generate and control the crowd.","1062-922X","0-7803-4053-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1997.633247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=633247","","Chaos;Cities and towns;Shape control;Computer graphics;Animals;Humans;Atmospheric modeling;Automatic control;Atmosphere;Prototypes","virtual reality;chaos","moving crowd generation;chaos model;moving crowd graphics;3D virtual city;attractor;crowd shape;folk dance;street;virtual reality","","3","","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, different crews / groups creating the participants' experience resort to different scenarios, which can finally lead to absolutely unlike results including those that concern flight safety. In the course of a game situation, pilots can see the interaction process, on the one hand, and they are engaged into it, on the other hand. Everyone resorts to their own scenario and can see what their actions lead to in the end of the game. During the game, one could study how leadership skills are demonstrated and how situational understanding of any following action is formed by the group when a passenger in a game situation spontaneously assumes responsibility and says: “Landed ...”, i.e. the game generates a chain of the situations that requests decision-making.

"Generalized cable equation model for myelinated nerve fiber","P. D. Einziger; L. M. Livshitz; J. Mizrahi","Dept. of Electr.

The myelinated membrane conductivity is represented via the Fourier series expansion. The classical cable equation is thereby modified into a linear second order ordinary differential equation with periodic coefficients, known as Hill's equation. The general internal source response, expressed via repeated convolutions, uniformly converges provided that the entire periodic membrane is passive. The solution can be interpreted as an extended source response in an equivalent nonmyelinated axon (i.e., the response is governed by the classical cable equation). The extended source consists of the original source and a novel activation function, replacing the periodic membrane in the myelinated axon model. Hill's equation is explicitly integrated for the specific choice of piecewise constant membrane conductivity profile, thereby resulting in an explicit closed form expression for the transmembrane potential in terms of trigonometric functions. The Floquet's modes are recognized as the nerve fiber activation modes, which are conventionally associated with the nonlinear Hodgkin-Huxley formulation. They can also be incorporated in our linear model, provided that the periodic membrane point-wise passivity constraint is properly modified. Indeed, the modified condition, enforcing the periodic membrane passivity constraint on the average conductivity only leads, for the first time, to the inclusion of the nerve fiber activation modes in our novel model. The validity of the generalized transmission-line and cable equation models for a myelinated nerve fiber, is verified herein through a rigorous Green's function formulation and numerical simulations for transmembrane potential induced in three-dimensional myelinated cylindrical cell. It is shown that the dominant pole contribution of the exact modal expansion is the transmembrane potential solution of our generalized model.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.856031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510847","Cable equation;Floquet's theory;Hill's equation;myelinated axon;nerve activation;transmission-line model","Nerve fibers;Biomembranes;Conductivity;Bioelectric phenomena;Electric potential;Transmission lines;Power cables;Differential equations;Fourier series;Nonlinear equations","neurophysiology;physiological models;biomembranes;bioelectric potentials;Fourier series;linear differential equations;Green's function methods;cellular biophysics","generalized cable equation model;myelinated nerve fiber;myelinated membrane conductivity;Fourier series expansion;linear second order ordinary differential equation;periodic coefficients;Hill equation;general internal source response;repeated convolutions;nonmyelinated axon;transmembrane potential;Floquet modes;nerve fiber activation modes;nonlinear Hodgkin-Huxley formulation;periodic membrane passivity constraint;generalized transmission-line equation;Green function;three-dimensional myelinated cylindrical cell","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Animals;Axons;Computer Simulation;Electric Conductivity;Humans;Membrane Potentials;Models, Neurological;Nerve Fibers, Myelinated;Neural Conduction","12","","24","","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It involves computing the propagating point-source response (PPSR), which is the potential arising from a single point source (dipole or tripole) travelling along the fiber. The PPSR can be applied to fibers of different conduction velocities by simple dilation or compression. The method is illustrated for oblique and spiralling nerve fibers. Potentials from oblique fibers are shown to be different for orthodromic and antidromic propagation. Such results show that the straight-line models are not always adequate for nerves with anatomical amounts of curvature.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.387199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=387199","","Nerve fibers;Conductors;Poisson equations;Integral equations;Computational modeling;Geometry;Temperature;Velocity measurement;Nonuniform electric fields;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","neurophysiology;bioelectric potentials;physiological models","curved nerves;arbitrary finite limbs;finite limbs;volume-conducted nerve-fiber action-potentials;propagating point-source response;fiber conduction velocity;spiralling nerve fibers;oblique nerve fibers;antidromic propagation;orthodromic propagation;straight-line models;anatomical curvature;single point source;dipole;tripole","Action Potentials;Animals;Anisotropy;Extremities;Humans;Mathematics;Models, Neurological;Nerve Fibers;Nerve Fibers;Neural Conduction","14","","47","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the conceptual level, we particularly analyse the three stages involved in mental functional mode of human action: sensory, perceptual, and representational (SPR). We proposed some structural models for basic functional modules and for the entire sensory-motor chain. The basic evidences that motivate us to consider fuzzy systems as suitable models for mental mechanisms in terms of sensory-motor changes are discussed. In this research we developed some minimal fuzzy inference systems simulating sensory, perception and representation blocks with specific fuzzified inputs. The three blocks connected into so called SPR structure is simulated in a certain scenario of human action and the results are analyzed from the perspective of human consistency. The proposed model is designed as a general case to study the action mode based on visual stimuli with common task to avoid the collision with an obstacle by controlling braking in car driving.

These principles seek to contribute to developing a specific visual grammar, which is essential if Augmented Reality is to go beyond technological performance to acquire the status of a true media, like all other vision-based media. This visual grammar constitutes a reference based on which designers may then build projects whose narrative and/or emotional content captivates the end-user. The research presented starts from an artistic approach through design and derives generic principles. The starting point is the development of actual AR installations and their presentation to the general public in the form of an evolving exhibition entitled Give Me More. Following two initial presentations in Lausanne and San Francisco, Give Me More was the winner of the DMY International Design Festival Berlin 2010. The designers' work relies on the software and research of the EPFL Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab) and Dr Julien Pilet. The results have made it possible to define certain rules for visual links between the physical and virtual worlds, simple narrative principles for the animations and a global approach for the design of representation devices.

Our approach uses a graph structure to model, dynamically, the way one object can influence another. It uses a lightweight message system to cause actions between objects. It has routines to encode each kind of general physical behaviour. Any given object can have multiple independent behaviours and these behaviours can be extended to give a richer range of outcomes. These outcomes arise from the creative use to which the objects are put by the user, rather than from predetermined actions built-in when the VE was designed.

Generalized steering algorithms, such as steer-to-center, simply move the user toward locations that are considered to be collision free in most cases. The algorithm developed here, FORCE, identifies collision-free paths by using a map of the tracking area's shape and obstacles, in addition to a multistep, probabilistic prediction of the user's virtual path through a known virtual environment. In the present implementation, the path predictions describe a user's possible movements through a virtual store with aisles. Based on both the user's physical and virtual location / orientation, a search-based optimization technique identifies the optimal steering instruction given the possible user paths. Path prediction uses the map of the virtual world; consequently, the search may propose steering instructions that put the user close to walls if the user's future actions eventually lead away from the wall. Results from both simulated and real users are presented. FORCE identifies collision-free paths in 55.0 percent of the starting conditions compared to 46.1 percent for generalized methods.

We consider modeling based on relevant attributes, e.g. weight and stability of parts. The proposed approach thereby entails human-robot interaction, mathematical modeling, both semantics and pragmatics in commonsense knowledge, as well as challenges specific to the application domain.

Through examining solutions to different tasks, it can uncover behavioral invariances in the domain, by identifying actions to be prioritized in local contexts, invariant to task details. This information has the effect of greatly increasing the speed of solving new problems. We formalise this notion as action priors, defined as distributions over the action space, conditioned on environment state, and show how these can be learnt from a set of value functions. We apply action priors in the setting of reinforcement learning, to bias action selection during exploration. Aggressive use of action priors performs context based pruning of the available actions, thus reducing the complexity of lookahead during search. We additionally define action priors over observation features, rather than states, which provides further flexibility and generalizability, with the additional benefit of enabling feature selection. Action priors are demonstrated in experiments in a simulated factory environment and a large random graph domain, and show significant speed ups in learning new tasks. Furthermore, we argue that this mechanism is cognitively plausible, and is compatible with findings from cognitive psychology.","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2015.2419715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079487","Action ordering;action selection;reinforcement learning;search pruning;transfer learning","Learning (artificial intelligence);Context;Robots;Equations;Training;Decision making;Buildings","decision making;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence)","action priors;domain invariance learning;decision making problems;behavioral invariances;reinforcement learning;action selection;context based pruning;lookahead complexity;feature selection;cognitive psychology","","1","","34","","3 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technology level was significantly improved through practical application at disaster sites such as the Mt. Unzen-fugendake eruption in 1994 and the Usu volcano eruption in 2000. On the other hand, underwater work in harbors largely depends on divers because the scale of work is smaller and manual work is generally more appropriate. Another reason is that the special environments can lead to technological difficulties. Underwater work by divers, however, may be inefficient depending on oceanographic phenomena such as poor visibility and strong tidal currents, and it may also be unsafe because of the difficulty in perceiving and avoiding danger. In addition, long hours of underwater work can lead to a heavy physical load caused by the hydraulic pressure, placing greater demands on the worker than when working on land. In order to solve these issues, we propose the use of Augmented Reality technology for the teleoperation of underwater equipment. Using a laboratory model, we conducted controlled experiments and investigations on the reflection-force sensor mechanism. For the interface section, we fabricated a figure input unit similar in relationship to the front part of a backhoe, and conducted experiments to confirm the operational efficiency of its pointing action.

The objective of this project is to develop software tools to provide enhanced real-time situational awareness to support the decision making and system control actions of transmission operators. The integrated tool will combine high-performance dynamic simulation with synchrophasor measurement data to assess in real time system dynamic performance and operation security risk. The project includes: (i) The development of high-performance dynamic simulation software; (ii) the development of new computationally effective measurement-based tools to estimate operating margins of a power system in real time using measurement data from synchrophasors and SCADA; (iii) the development a hybrid framework integrating measurement-based and simulation-based approaches, and (iv) the use of cutting-edge visualization technology to display various system quantities and to visually process the results of the hybrid measurement-base/simulation-based security-assessment tool. Parallelization and high performance computing are utilized to enable ultrafast transient stability analysis that can be used in a real-time environment to quickly perform “what-if” simulations involving system dynamics phenomena. EPRI's Extended Transient Midterm Simulation Program (ETMSP) is modified and enhanced for this work. The contingency analysis is scaled for large-scale contingency analysis using MPI-based parallelization. Simulations of thousands of contingencies on a high performance computing machine are performed, and results show that parallelization over contingencies with MPI provides good scalability and computational gains. Different ways to reduce the I/O bottleneck have been also exprored. Thread-parallelization of the sparse linear solve is explored also through use of the SuperLU_MT library. Based on performance profiling results for the implicit method, the majority of CPU time is spent on the integration steps. Hence, in order to further improve the ETMSP performance, a variable time step control scheme for the original trapezoidal integration method has been developed and implemented. The Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method was introduced and designed for ETMSP. Test results show superior performance with this method.","1932-5517","978-1-4799-6415-4","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939091","","Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Power system dynamics;Power measurement;Time measurement;Software measurement;Hybrid power systems","computer software;data visualisation;decision making;integration;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;power system transient stability;power transmission control;predictor-corrector methods;SCADA systems","thread-parallelization;sparse linear solver;SuperLU_MT library;CPU time;variable time step control scheme;trapezoidal integration method;Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method;computing machine;MPI-based parallelization;contingency analysis;ETMSP performance;extended transient midterm simulation program;EPRI;transient stability analysis;hybrid measurement-based-simulation-based security-assessment tool;visualization technology;SCADA;power system;dynamic simulation software;operation security risk;synchrophasor measurement data;transmission operators;system control actions;decision making;software tools;DE-OE0000628;U.S. Department of Energy grant;proactive operator decision-support;hybrid simulation-measurement-based tools;security assessment;computation tools","","","","","","30 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"SceneCam: Improving Multi-camera Remote Collaboration using Augmented Reality","T. A. Rasmussen; W. Huang","Aarhus University, Denmark; University of Technology Sydney","2019 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct)","9 Jan 2020","2019","","","28","33","Systems for remote collaboration on physical tasks generally use AR/VR technologies to create a shared visual space for collaborators to perform tasks together. The shared space often comes from a single camera view. Prior research has not reported on the benefits of using multiple cameras for remote collaboration. On the contrary, there seems to be some usability issues, which must be addressed, when designing remote collaboration systems that use multiple cameras to capture different areas and perspectives of a task space. To be usable, a multi-camera remote collaboration system must indicate to the local user which camera the remote user is looking at and vice versa, the system must make it fast and easy for the remote user to obtain the right camera view for a given collaborative task. We present SceneCam, an AR prototype with which we explore different techniques for improving the usability of multi-camera remote collaboration by making camera selection easier and faster. Specifically, SceneCam implements two camera selection techniques. The first technique nudges the remote user to manually select an optimal camera view of the local user's actions. The second technique automatically selects an optimal camera view of the local user and shows it to the remote user. Additionally, SceneCam implements two focus-in-context views (exocentric and egocentric views) that provide the remote user with a spatial overview of the local user's whereabouts in relation to the multiple task space areas and direct visual access to the camera views of said areas. Camera selection techniques (manual point-and-click, nudging, automatic), and focus-in-context views (no focus-in-context view, exocentric, egocentric) make up the two dimensions in a design space for multi-camera remote collaboration. We describe how SceneCam spans this design space. Lastly, as part of future work we discuss some hypotheses regarding the effects of the proposed camera selection techniques, focus-in-context views and combinations hereof on the usability of multi-camera remote collaboration.","","978-1-7281-4765-9","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2019.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951899","Remote collaboration;Augmented Reality;Multiple cameras;Usability","Cameras;Task analysis;Collaboration;Two dimensional displays;Visualization;Usability;Three-dimensional displays","augmented reality;cameras;data visualisation;groupware","SceneCam;single camera view;multiple cameras;multicamera remote collaboration system;camera selection techniques;optimal camera view;focus-in-context view;multiple task space areas;multicamera remote collaboration;augmented reality;AR/VR technologies;exocentric view;egocentric view","","","","16","","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This generates a strong need to understand the neural, cognitive and perceptual mechanisms leveraged by this technology. Because the most advanced wearable AR technologies support gestural interaction with real content, in our study we exploit the well known dissociation between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action to understand how the user's cognitive systems encode the AR space, to introduce novel methodologies to support UI design in AR, and to provide general guidelines for designing visual and interactive spaces in AR. In two experiments we find a dissociation between visual-only estimates of depth and motor finger-reaching to similar elements, supporting the idea that AR space leverages similar mechanisms as the real world, and can be designed accordingly.","","978-1-4673-8471-1","10.1109/ISMARW.2015.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344748","Mixed/Augmented Reality;Psychophysics;Depth Perception;Gestural Interactions","Visualization;Sensitivity;Three-dimensional displays;Context;Yttrium;Augmented reality;Presses","augmented reality;cognitive systems;gesture recognition;wearable computers","depth perception;wearable augmented reality;AR;user interaction;neural mechanisms;cognitive mechanisms;perceptual mechanisms;gestural interaction;vision-for-perception;vision-for-action;UI design","","","","5","","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different methodological approaches and different tools have been used in the assessment of brain-injured patient's navigational abilities. These procedures include auto-evaluation questionnaires, evaluation of general cognitive level, mental rotation tasks or specifically suited visual-spatial tasks. All these methodologies have shown a moderate correlation between the results of these kinds of evaluation and the navigational ability impairment observed in everyday contexts. Meanwhile, the evaluation of patient's spatial orientation out of laboratory setting appears to be an unprofitable opportunity for clinicians. Thus the problem in designing an effective assessment tool is still open. A promising approach could be to integrate classical evaluation tools with computer-based interactive ones, such as virtual reality. According to this framework, we propose a combination of classical and virtual reality-based assessment, in which perceptive, memory and attentional functions (that combined each other are considered the hub for spatial orientation ability) will be evaluated with standardized neuropsychological tests and a more situated computer-based tools will allow the assessment of spatial orientation during the interaction with complex environments. Strictly linked with ""paper and pencil"" spatial disorientation neuropsychological evaluation, we propose two 3D virtual reality tools based on Wisc-R Maze subtest and road map test, customized to match interactive evaluation requirements. The first will provide the possibility to evaluate human ability of finding the best route to achieve a target goal while immersed in an empty environment. The second can be used to evaluate the ability in creating relationships between various points of the environment and in inferring, through the reasoning process, high-level spatial organization knowledge. By providing the possibility to track user's spatial behaviours, a virtual reality-based evaluation allows an effective and objective record of all the experimental variables. It also avoids the intervention of the experimenter, which may interfere with the actions of the agent-explorer.

Zhou","School of Philosophy, Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China","IEEE Access","2 Sep 2020","2020","8","","155563","155575","In virtual reality scenes, the premise of moving target recognition in video is accurate target segmentation and extraction of target low-level features. In order to distinguish moving targets, it is not enough to use the underlying features. Further extraction of structural features that reflect the target structure can improve the recognition and tracking of moving targets. In order to ensure the stability of the feature areas extracted from the three-channel most stable extremum region, this article proposes an improved algorithm of the three-channel most stable extremum region to improve the three-channel most stable extremum region. The algorithm can adaptively select the filters of each channel to filter the feature regions extracted from the three most stable extreme value regions. An action cycle is generally 30~50 frames, so it is faster and more advantageous to directly use the first 50 frames of video for processing. In this article, two feature representation methods of variance gait energy graph algorithm and image splitting algorithm are proposed. The variance energy graph algorithm significantly improves the recognition rate; image splitting enhances the robustness of behavior classification. This article proposes a feature representation algorithm of “distance from contour line to center line” to improve the recognition rate. By analyzing the feature extraction methods of principal component analysis, Fisher linear discriminant analysis and maximum divergence difference discriminant analysis, the main component discriminant analysis of row maximum divergence discriminant column and the two-dimensional two-dimensional maximum divergence discriminant analysis of row and column are proposed. This further enhances the ability to classify behaviors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019233","Project of Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities: The Experimental Research on the Introduction of Healthy Physical Fitness Into Calisthenics Teaching; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177108","Human motion video;feature extraction;improved three-channel most stable extreme value area;virtual reality","Feature extraction;Virtual reality;Face recognition;Face;Trajectory;Target tracking;Filtering algorithms","feature extraction;graph theory;image classification;image representation;image segmentation;principal component analysis;virtual reality","variance energy graph algorithm;image splitting algorithm;variance gait energy graph algorithm;stable extreme value regions;feature regions;stable extremum region;feature areas;target tracking;target structure;structural features;underlying features;moving targets;target low-level features;accurate target segmentation;target recognition;virtual reality scenes;virtual reality technology;human motion video;feature extraction methods;feature representation algorithm;recognition rate","","","","32","CCBY","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method consists on harvesting, recording and processing of EEG data from an Emotiv Epoc+ headset. Support vector machine (SVM), linear neural network (NN) and decision trees (DT) are used to build machine learning models and are compared based on statistical measures. The models are trained on two control states: forward and backward, in order to control the character in the game. In the first stage of modeling, each user is built using its own unique model based on the data gathered during user training. Then a more general model is developed to allow plug and play interactions with many users, without the need for retraining. The proposed classifiers are able to sufficiently model brain control for a single user with acceptable errors for the motor action training dataset, but fail to generalize to datasets with multiple users. Feature extraction improves learning of the models like neural network, but decreases the number of learning samples which calls for more datasets to generalize results for multiple users.

The results show that subjects performed best with small-size-simple structures and large-size-complex structures in VR. Movement execution was generally faster and more precise on simple structures. Performance was less precise when the dominant hand was used to follow the complex structures and small object size in VR. It is concluded that both size and structural complexity critically influence task execution in VR when no tactile feed-back from object to finger is generated. Individual learning curves should be monitored from the beginning of the training as suggested by the individual speed-precision analyses.","","978-1-5386-3365-6","10.1109/VR.2018.8446217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8446217","Computing methodologies-Computer Graphics-Graphic systems and interfaces-Virtual reality;Human-centered computing-Human computer interaction (HCI)-Interaction paradigms-Virtual reality;Human-centered computing-Human computer interaction (HCI)-Interaction devices;Human-centered computing-Interaction design;Software and its engineering-Software organization and properties-Virtual worlds software-Virtual worlds training simulations","Indexes;Complexity theory;Three-dimensional displays;Head;Software;Image color analysis;Virtual reality","biomechanics;feedback;helmet mounted displays;image processing;physiological models;virtual reality","structural complexity;image size;hand movements;virtual reality simulators;VR mediated human actions;index finger;tactile feedback;physiological structure;complex structures;speed-precision analyses;head mounted virtual reality;learning curves","","2","","41","","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such simulation techniques are mostly employed in virtual military training sessions and in real time gaming experiences, where users have to make more strategic decisions by analyzing the information they receive, in response to the actions of the other users in the same virtual environment. Generally, in the real world, collaborative decision making takes place when a team of people work together to control the behaviour of a single object which cannot be handled alone by an individual. A ship with its crew can be held as an example. When applying this scenario into virtually simulated environments, multiple users have to involve in representing a single object in the virtual world. These users need to obtain sufficient information about the activities in the environment that will contribute to the collaborative decision making process. Out of many sources, visual information is the most reliable source the users tend to depend on. The use of traditional static displays to obtain visual information limits the capability of providing a rich set of information about the 3D environment. Head Mounted Displays address these limitations while introducing several new problems. On the otherhand, our work is focused on exploring how smart devices can be employed by a collaboratively working team of users to obtain visual information to the level beyond which a static display provides, thus aiding the process of decision making. To serve the above purpose, we propose a solution, “Virtual Eye”, which uses a smart mobile device with the ability to view the visual output of the virtual world and the ability to control that view according to user's orientation changes and movements with the use of its inbuilt sensors.","","978-1-4673-5530-8","10.1109/ICTer.2012.6422831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422831","Virtual reality;collaborative decision making;mobile;sensors;streaming","Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Visualization;Servers;Communication channels;Optical reflection;Optical sensors","computer games;decision making;digital simulation;mobile computing;sensors;virtual reality","virtual eye;sensor based mobile viewer;aid collaborative decision making;virtual environments;virtual simulation techniques;multiuser interactivity;virtual military training sessions;virtual world;collaborative decision making process;visual information;head mounted displays;static display","","1","","13","","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this immersion, virtual reality applications must interact with physical systems, that generally consist of command and control electronics, actuators and a sensory system. This paper presents a series of experiments performed by the authors in order to determine three major steps in the process of interaction between hardware systems and software emulating virtual environments: transpose the events from Unity virtual environment into signals necessary to control a physical system, transmission of the signals generated by the sensory system and, interpretation and conversion of those signals into events for the virtual reality application. Because interconnection involves both receiving and transmitting signals, the authors propose a two-way control interface implemented on different development boards. At the same time, the experiments aimed to observe the response of the physical systems and to determine an algorithm for correlating the action of the physical system, with a proportionality factor of one to one, related to the events that occurred in the virtual reality.","2372-1618","978-1-7281-9809-5","10.1109/ICSTCC50638.2020.9259668","European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259668","Virtual environment;Unity;Control;Communication","Hardware;Games;Virtual environments;Software;Microcontrollers;Three-dimensional displays;Mechatronics","control engineering computing;mechatronics;signal processing;user interfaces;virtual reality","complex virtual environments;virtual reality application;command and control electronics;sensory system;hardware systems;Unity virtual environment;mechatronic systems;actuators;physical system control;signal transmission;two-way control interface","","","","9","","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model of Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) describes these time-dependent complex ion dynamics. We have implemented the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, one of the simplified versions of HH model on a pyramidal neuron with branches of axons to study the spontaneous activity of neurons. The network is then coupled to Micro-Electrode Arrays to record the extracellular potential in a neurochip environment. This in silico model is used to study the coupling of AP with the electrodes. Such a model is also a first step to investigate the morphological influence of neurons on their signaling properties.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319443","","Mathematical model;Electrodes;Computational modeling;Electric potential;Numerical models","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;microelectrodes;neurophysiology","3D axonal network;microelectrode arrays;simulation model;neuronal dynamics;action potentials;ion exchange;membrane;Hodgkin model;Huxley model;time-dependent complex ion dynamics;FitzHugh-Nagumo model;HH model;pyramidal neuron;spontaneous activity;extracellular potential;neurochip environment;in silico model;morphological influence;signaling properties","Action Potentials;Axons;Finite Element Analysis;Microelectrodes;Models, Neurological;Pyramidal Cells","1","","21","","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

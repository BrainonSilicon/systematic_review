As a result, information regarding task-induced signal changes cannot be correctly extracted. Presented here is a novel technique for performing two-dimensional rigid-body image registration addressing the head motion problem in fMRI. The approach is based on a one-dimensional projection of a segmented two-dimensional characteristic image, in which the translation and rotation parameters are obtained by comparison between the projection of an image and a registration table created by projections of a selected two-dimensional image with various rotated angles. In such an approach, the general two-dimensional optimization procedure is replaced by a linear projection calculation and a finite comparison with a registration table, thus the amount of computation is considerably reduced. The method was confirmed by simulation test and a preliminary application to vivo fMRI data based visual stimulation.","","0-7803-7925-X","10.1109/RISSP.2003.1285768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285768","","Data processing;Image registration;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image segmentation;Magnetic heads;Educational institutions;Data mining;Computational modeling;Testing;Partial response channels","image registration;medical image processing;biomedical MRI","fMRI data processing method;functional magnetic resonance imaging;projection technique;head motion problem;two dimensional rigid body image registration;one dimensional projection;image registration table;two dimensional optimization;linear projection calculation;fMRI data based visual stimulation","","","","12","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Approaches such as post-smoothing (PS) and total variation (TV) denoising can help reduce noise at the cost of resolution or bias, respectively. However, recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have lead to promising results in low count PET. Some of these can take advantage of jointly acquired data from other modalities such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, there are many considerations when designing an architecture depending on the specific task and data available. This work compares some of the current state-of-the-art approaches. Results demonstrate that more powerful, complex networks do not necessarily yield better performance. Normalised root mean squared error (NRMSE) is decreased by 85.5% compared to standard maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (MLEM) PET reconstruction by using a 3-layer micro-network on very low (3.01M) count simulation data. This compares to reductions of 80.2% and 85.3% when total variation (TV) edge enhancement and an adversarial discriminator are incorporated into the loss function, respectively. Using both TV and a discriminator term produces a slightly better whole-brain NRMSE reduction of 86.0%, though with a risk of false positive lesions. This indicates that more investigation is required to determine general rules for choosing architectures and hyperparameters for low count PET.","2577-0829","978-1-7281-4164-0","10.1109/NSS/MIC42101.2019.9059905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9059905","Machine Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Adversarial;Image Processing","Training;Three-dimensional displays;TV;Biomedical imaging;Magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;Image reconstruction","biomedical MRI;brain;convolutional neural nets;expectation-maximisation algorithm;image denoising;image reconstruction;image resolution;iterative methods;maximum likelihood estimation;mean square error methods;medical image processing;positron emission tomography","radiation dose;noisy reconstructed images;whole-brain NRMSE reduction;positron emission tomography;low count PET-MR post-processing;3d convolutional adversarial micronetworks;adversarial discriminator;total variation edge enhancement;3-layer micronetwork;standard maximum likelihood expectation maximisation PET reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging;convolutional neural networks","","","","13","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transformation includes interpolation which estimates the intensity values of floating image other than the grid points. For nonrigid registration, generally the transformation is modeled using B-spline basis function. As the acquired images are deformed and contains bias field, it is very time consuming to reform the grid at each level. Considering the registration process as an optimization problem, the grid points are adaptively chosen and updated iteratively with a new transformation in each step. In this paper, an adaptive knot placement algorithm is presented for P-spline interpolation method to achieve accurate alignment of local deformation with less computation time. The proposed algorithm is validated with 3 sets of simulated brain images with a known distortion and 2 real brain MR image data sets. Different performance measures such as MSE, RMS, NAE are used to evaluate the qualitative measure of the proposed scheme. Estimated transformation grid and evaluated performance measures show the improvement in the proposed algorithm as compared to the other existing state-of-arts.","","978-1-5090-5163-2","10.1109/TechSym.2016.7872691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872691","Non-rigid registration;mutual information;B-spline;P-spline","Splines (mathematics);Interpolation;Cost function;Biomedical imaging;Smoothing methods;Mathematical model;Adaptation models","biomedical MRI;brain;estimation theory;image registration;interpolation;medical image processing;optimisation;splines (mathematics)","nonrigid medical image registration;adaptive knot selection;deformed floating image grid points;reference image grids;floating image intensity value estimation;B-spline basis function;optimization problem;adaptive knot placement algorithm;P-spline interpolation;local deformation alignment;brain MR image data sets","","","","13","","9 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based harmonic regression technique to remove BCG artifacts from EEG recorded in the MR scanner. Our technique uses physically motivated parametric models of the BCG artifact and the true EEG signal, and incorporates maximum likelihood approaches to identify model parameters, estimate and subtract the BCG from corrupted EEG measurements. We show that this method effectively removes BCG artifacts from EEG recorded in the MR scanner, restores simulated oscillatory signatures and enables over 20-fold improvement in SNR in bands of interest. Further, unlike common BCG removal techniques that rely on cardiac or motion reference signals, our approach is reference-free and thus is useful when reference signals are corrupted or difficult to acquire.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610776","","Electroencephalography;Oscillators;Brain modeling;Harmonic analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Spectrogram","biomedical MRI;electroencephalography;maximum likelihood estimation;medical signal processing;regression analysis;spatiotemporal phenomena","cardiac signals;motion reference signals;EEG;BCG;maximum likelihood approaches;model-based harmonic regression;head movement;cardiac pulsation;ballistocardiogram;spatiotemporal resolution imaging;cognitive brain states;clinical brain states;fMRI;functional MRI;electroencephalogram;EEG-fMRI ballistocardiogram artifact removal;reference-free harmonic regression","Algorithms;Artifacts;Ballistocardiography;Electroencephalography;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Likelihood Functions;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Regression Analysis","1","","13","","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we consider the damaged image data or missing through-plane slices as image masks and proposed an edge-guided generative adversarial network to restore brain MRI images. Inspired by the procedure of image inpainting, our proposed method decouples image repair into two stages: edge connection and contrast completion, both of which used general adversarial networks (GAN). We trained and tested on a dataset from the Human Connectome Project to test the application of our method for thick slice imputation, while we tested the artifact correction on clinical data and simulated datasets. Our Edge-Guided GAN had superior PSNR, SSIM, conspicuity and signal texture compared to traditional imputation tools, the Context Encoder and the Densely Connected Super Resolution Network with GAN (DCSRN-GAN).

In this paper, we study the problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly N ≥ 3) exponential signals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor structure and the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of Hankel matrices.

Although some success has been demonstrated, these approaches generally are not suitable for high frame rate (HFR) imaging where broad transmit beams are required. In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence factor (CF) weighting and the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) method. The CF is a focusing quality index estimated from receive-channel data. It is the ratio between the energy of the coherent sum to the total incoherent energy. This method is an adaptive weighting technique in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF such that the unwanted side lobes are reduced. Direct implementation of the CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging affect accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we overcome this problem by applying the MVDR method to the delayed channel data. Specifically, the MVDR method is used for angle of arrival estimation. The beam sum data are then weighted by the estimated CF. A synthetic transmit aperture method is used for HFR imaging. Only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data are used. In the experiments, clinical breast data are acquired using a programmable array system. With the proposed method, the average contrast enhancement is 4.59 dB and the average CNR enhancement is 20.19%. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can improve image quality. Even for HFR imaging with only 8 firings per image, effective contrast enhancement and better lesion boundary can be achieved. Efficacy of the proposed method is clearly demonstrated.","1051-0117","978-1-4244-2428-3","10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4803683","high frame rate imaging ultrasound adaptive imaing;coherent factor;MVDR","Focusing;Ultrasonic imaging;Biomedical imaging;Image quality;Breast;Delay estimation;Biomedical electronics;Bioinformatics;Pixel;Accuracy","array signal processing;biomedical ultrasonics;direction-of-arrival estimation;image enhancement;mammography;medical image processing","high-frame rate adaptive imaging method;coherence factor weighting;MVDR method;broad transmit beams;minimum variance distortionless response;image pixel;delayed channel data;angle-of-arrival estimation;clinical breast imaging data;programmable array system;average contrast enhancement;image quality;lesion boundary;ultrasound imaging;adaptive beamforming techniques","","6","","6","","21 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With subaperture beamformed channel data and a modification to the input layer of the DNN architecture to accept these data, the fidelity of image reconstruction increased (e.g., mean gCNR of multiple acquisitions of two in vivo breast cysts ranged 0.89-0.96), but DNN display frame rates were reduced from 395 to 287 Hz. Overall, the DNNs successfully translated feature representations learned from simulated data to phantom and in vivo data, which is promising for this novel approach to simultaneous ultrasound image formation and segmentation.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2993779","NIH Trailblazer; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090910","Beamforming;deep learning;fully convolutional neural network (FCNN);image segmentation;neural network","Ultrasonic imaging;Image segmentation;Training;Task analysis;Array signal processing;Machine learning;Decoding","array signal processing;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;image reconstruction;image resolution;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;phantoms;ultrasonic imaging","in vivo test data;standard deviation Dice similarity coefficients;contrast-to-noise ratios;subaperture beamformed channel data;image reconstruction;DNN display frame rates;simultaneous ultrasound image formation;deep learning;segmentation outputs;raw ultrasound channel data;automated imaging tasks;suboptimal image quality;deep neural networks;segmentation map;automated ultrasound tasks;ultrasound B-mode image;interpretable supervision;visualizing segmenting anechoic targets;in vivo data sets;unfocused input channel data;time delays;single-plane wave insonification;high-ultrasound frame rates;single-plane wave transmissions;in vivo breast cysts;frequency 287.0 Hz to 395.0 Hz","","6","","66","CCBY","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High-frame-rate speckle tracking, using plane wave transmits, has shown potential for 2-D blood velocity estimation. However, due to the lack of focusing in transmit, image quality gets reduced, which hampers speckle tracking. Although ultrafast imaging facilitates improved clutter filtering, it still remains a major challenge in blood velocity estimation. Signal dropouts and poor velocity estimates are still present for high beam-to-flow angles and low blood flow velocities. In this paper, ultrafast plane wave imaging was combined with multiscale speckle tracking to assess the 2-D blood velocity vector in a common carotid artery (CCA) flow field. A multiangled plane wave imaging sequence was used to compare the performance of displacement compounding, coherent compounding, and compound speckle tracking. Zero-degree plane wave imaging was also evaluated. The performance of the methods was evaluated before and after clutter filtering for the large range of velocities (0-1.5 m/s) that are normally present in a healthy CCA during the cardiac cycle. An extensive simulation study was performed, based on a sophisticated model of the CCA, to investigate and evaluate the performance of the methods at different pulse repetition frequencies and signal-to-noise levels. In vivo data were acquired of a healthy carotid artery bifurcation to support the simulation results. In general, methods utilizing compounding after speckle tracking, i.e., displacement compounding and compound speckle tracking, were least affected by clutter filtering and provided the most robust and accurate estimates for the entire velocity range. Displacement compounding, which uses solely axial information to estimate the velocity vector, provided most accurate velocity estimates, although it required sufficiently high pulse repetition frequencies in high blood velocity phases and reliable estimates for all acquisition angles. When this latter requirement was not met, compound speckle tracking was most accurate, because it uses the possibility to discard angular velocity estimates corrupted by clutter filtering. Similar effects were observed for in vivo data obtained at the carotid artery bifurcation. Investigating a combination of these two compounding techniques is recommended for future research.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2606565","Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Ministry of Economic Affairs; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562358","Blood flow;compounding;plane wave imaging;ultrafast imaging;vector velocity imaging","Imaging;Blood;Speckle;Clutter;Ultrasonic imaging;Filtering;Two dimensional displays","biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;haemodynamics","2D blood velocity estimation;image quality;speckle tracking;ultrafast imaging;clutter filtering;low-blood flow velocity;ultrafast plane wave imaging;2D blood velocity vector;carotid artery flow field;multiangled plane wave imaging sequence;cardiac cycle;signal-to-noise levels;carotid artery bifurcation;speckle tracking;velocity vector;high-pulse repetition frequencies;high-blood velocity phases;high-frame-rate speckle tracking;ultrasound beam direction;carotid artery model;blood vector velocity imaging;beam-steered plane wave imaging;color Doppler imaging","Blood Flow Velocity;Carotid Artery, Common;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Cardiovascular;Ultrasonography","11","","33","","7 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Measurements were made on a static heart phantom and on 12 pigs undergoing gated cardiac MRI and 2 dynamic H/sub 2//sup 15/O PET. The 3 methods to compute PV correction factors (PVCF) were: 1. A gated MRI myocardial mask temporally and spatially blurred to the PET resolution; 2. an extra-vascular image (EV) created by subtracting the arterial phase of the H/sub 2//sup 15/O bolus from a transmission image; 3. kinetic modeling (fit) of the water data. The phantom study confirmed that 7.0 mm Gaussian blurring simulated the scanner resolution, and that the water subtraction correctly determined PVCF from EV (vs theory and vs blurred MRI). PVCF for 60 regions were computed from the 12 pigs using each method. There was no significant systematic difference between PVCF obtained from the 3 methods. When we used only one water acquisition, all the slopes (intercepts) except EV vs MRI were not significantly lower than unity (greater than zero) but there is large variability in the data. When we used two water acquisitions summed together, we saw a slight improvement in the correlations between the methods although the variability did not go down as much as expected. Several factors may contribute to the remaining variability, and to any potential systematic differences which may be present but which we were unable to detect. In general we found a good agreement between the three methods.

Compressive deconvolution (CD), combining compressed sensing and image deconvolution, represents an interesting possibility to consider this challenging task. The model of CD includes, in addition to the compressive sampling matrix, a 2-D convolution operator carrying the information on the system point spread function. Through this model, the resolution of reconstructed US images from compressed measurements mainly depends on three aspects: the acquisition setup, i.e., the incoherence of the sampling matrix, the image regularization, i.e., the sparsity prior, and the optimization technique. In this paper, we mainly focused on the last two aspects. We proposed a novel simultaneous direction method of multipliers based optimization scheme to invert the linear model, including two regularization terms expressing the sparsity of the RF images in a given basis and the generalized Gaussian statistical assumption on tissue reflectivity functions. The performance of the method is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2593795","ANR-11-LABX-0040-CIMI within the program ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02 of the University of Toulouse and CSC (Chinese Scholarship Council); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518598","Compressive deconvolution (CD);simultaneous direction method of multipliers (SDMM);ultrasound (US) imaging","Image coding;Deconvolution;Optimization;Imaging;Image reconstruction;Ultrasonic imaging;Radio frequency","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;data compression;deconvolution;image coding;image enhancement;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sampling;medical image processing;optical transfer function;optimisation","enhanced ultrasound image reconstruction;compressed measurements;simultaneous direction method of multipliers;high-resolution ultrasound image reconstruction;image resolution;compressive deconvolution;compressed sensing;compressive sampling;point spread function;sampling matrix;image regularization;optimization;generalized Gaussian statistical assumption;tissue reflectivity functions","","11","1","42","","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, nonadaptive DAS reconstructed cardiac PA images exhibit temporally varying noise which causes reduced myocardial PA signal specificity, making image interpretation difficult. Adaptive beamforming algorithms such as minimum variance (MV) with coherence factor (CF) weighting have been previously reported to improve the DAS image quality. In this article, we report on an adaptive beamforming algorithm by extending CF weighting to the temporal domain for preclinical cardiac PA imaging (PAI). The proposed spatiotemporal coherence factor (STCF) considers multiple temporally adjacent image acquisition events during beamforming and cancels out signals with low spatial coherence and temporal coherence, resulting in higher background noise cancellation while preserving the main features of interest (myocardial wall) in the resultant PA images. STCF has been validated using the numerical simulations and in vivo ECG and respiratory-signal-gated cardiac PAI in healthy murine hearts. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that STCF weighting outperforms DAS and MV beamforming with and without CF weighting under different levels of inherent contrast, acoustic attenuation, optical scattering, and signal-to-noise (SNR) of channel data. Performance improvement is attributed to higher sidelobe reduction (at least 5 dB) and SNR improvement (at least 10 dB). Improved myocardial signal specificity and higher signal rejection in the left ventricular chamber and acoustic gel region are observed with STCF in cardiac PAI.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3016900","National Institutes of Health; University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center; University of Wisconsin–Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9167275","Beamforming;cardiac photoacoustic imaging (PAI);coherence factor (CF);delay-and-sum (DAS);minimum variance (MV);noise reduction;PAI;spatiotemporal coherence","Array signal processing;Acoustics;Coherence;Apertures;Imaging;Image reconstruction;Myocardium","acoustic signal processing;array signal processing;biological tissues;biomedical optical imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;electrocardiography;image reconstruction;image resolution;medical image processing;medical signal processing;photoacoustic effect;spatiotemporal phenomena","photoacoustic image reconstruction;received acoustic waves;optical illumination;nonadaptive DAS;cardiac PA images;myocardial PA signal specificity;image interpretation;adaptive beamforming algorithm;DAS image quality;temporal domain;preclinical cardiac PA imaging;spatiotemporal coherence factor;temporally adjacent image acquisition events;background noise cancellation;myocardial wall;STCF weighting;MV beamforming;signal rejection;cardiac PAI;in vivo cardiac photoacoustic image beamformation;in vivo ECG;noise figure 5.0 dB;noise figure 10.0 dB;In","","1","","71","IEEE","14 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we developed an alternative nonlinear beamforming method for ultrasound imaging, termed an apodizing delay and auto-correlation reconstruction algorithm (ADAC). The computation complexity of ADAC is O(2N) which ensures a similar beamforming speed to DAS O(N), since both are on the same order of magnitude. We tested ADAC against DAS, on both Field II simulated data and experimental data acquired from imaging a standard CIRS calibration phantom. Results show that the ADAC beamformer compared with DAS that mitigated the self-nulling phenomenon of CIRS proximal targets and showed the weak-signal mapping ability up to an imaging depth of 65 mm. The image quality beamformed by ADAC from anechoic simulated data and interleaving B-mode showed an improved contrast ratio (CR), lateral, and axial resolution of 19 dB, 0.5 mm (lateral) and 0.3 mm mm (axial), respectively.

With plane-wave excitation (PWE), the high frame-rate reduces the scatterer displacement and thus increases the signal correlation. Nevertheless, the lower image quality with PWE may suffer from spatial velocity gradient outside the sample volume and reduce the achievable accuracy of speckle tracking. In this study, we propose a recursive PWE compounding technique to improve the image quality for accuracy of vector velocity estimation while the high-frame-rate nature of PWE for vector velocity estimation is retained. In the proposed compounding, several PWE images from different steering angles are combined coherently to suppress the beam sidelobes at the cost of longer acquisition time. The coherent PWE compounding is further combined with a recursive technique to generate high-resolution images with different features at a frame rate of pulse repetition frequency; thus retaining the high frame-rate nature. The neighboring high-resolution image pairs with the same image feature are utilized for velocity detection with speckle tracking. Extensive simulations were performed to test the recursive PWE compounding method for its performance in speckle-tracking based vector velocity estimation. Results indicate that, the lateral estimation is more susceptible to the spatial flow velocity gradient than the axial estimation is. When the Doppler angle is 0°, it is shown that the mean axial velocity remains close to the ideal parabolic profile while the detection of lateral velocity is markedly interfered by the flow gradient. In the case of large Doppler angle, it is also evident that an accurate lateral estimation is achieved with the coherent PWE compounding method. Note that the standard deviation with the PWE compounding is generally smaller as compared to the conventional PWE image, indicating the improved robustness in both lateral and axial estimation. Nevertheless, the error of lateral estimation is still larger than that of axial estimation. It is demonstrated that the recursive PWE compounding with speckle tracking is capable of improving estimation of vector velocity with high frame rate. In addition to vector velocity estimation, the proposed method can also be potentially applied to elastography.","1948-5727","978-1-4577-0381-2","10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935603","High frame rate ultrasound imaging;coherent plane wave compounding approach;speckle tracking technique;flow estimaiton","Estimation;Speckle;Focusing;Doppler effect;Accuracy;Image resolution","biomedical ultrasonics;Doppler measurement;haemodynamics;medical image processing;speckle","high frame-rate vector flow estimation;speckle tracking;recursive plane-wave compounding;scatterer displacement;signal correlation;spatial velocity gradient;image quality;pulse repetition frequency;recursive PWE compounding;Doppler angle;elastography","","2","5","5","","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This necessitates that the capacitive coupling introduced by the interconnecting lumped capacitors should maximize the separation between the resonance frequency of the fundamental mode and that of all other higher order modes. Alternatively, full-orthogonal excitation of the coil, if possible, would mitigate this design challenge, especially if high-Q operation cannot be guaranteed. In this contribution, a field theoretical technique for the optimization of the capacitive coupling is introduced and applied to the birdcage configuration as a representative of TEM coils. A fairly general analysis of these coils is also introduced and/or revisited, which underlies the proposed technique and offers simple analytic design equations. Simulation results are presented to validate the considered approach.

Toward this goal, much effort has been deployed in formulating models for US imaging, which usually require a large amount of memory to store the matrix coefficients. We present two different techniques, which take advantage of fast and matrix-free formulations derived for the measurement model and its adjoint, and rely on sparsity of US images in well-chosen models. Sparse regularization is used for enhanced image reconstruction. Compressed beamforming exploits the compressed sensing framework to restore high-quality images from fewer raw data than state-of-the-art approaches.

Conceivably, sequencing different atomic tasks can further augment the robot's capabilities as well as avoid repetitive demonstrations. In this paper, we propose to address the issue of multi-tasks sequencing with emphasis on handling the so-called competing constraints, which emerge due to the existence of the concurrent constraints from Cartesian and joint trajectories. Specifically, we explore the null space of the robot from an information-theoretic perspective in order to maintain imitation fidelity during transition between consecutive tasks.

Unfortunately, many current methods of implementation of HARDI require collecting a relatively large number of diffusion-encoded images, which is in turn translated in prohibitively long acquisition times. As a possible solution to this problem, one can undersample HARDI data by using fewer diffusion-encoding gradients than it is prescribed by the classical sampling theory, while exploiting the tools of compressed sensing (CS). Accordingly, the goal of the present paper is twofold. First, the paper presents a novel CS-based framework for the reconstruction of HARDI data using a reduced set of diffusion-encoding gradients. As opposed to similar studies reported in the literature, the proposed method has been optimized for the Rician statistics of measurement noises, which are known to be prevalent in HARDI, and in fact, in MRI in general. Second, we introduce the concept of rotational invariant Fourier signatures (RIFS), and show how they can be used to generate a composite HARDI contrast, which we refer to as colour-HARDI (cHARDI). Finally, via a series of experiments with both simulated and in vivo MRI data, we demonstrate that the quality and informativeness of the proposed contrast deteriorates little, when used in conjunction with the proposed CS-based reconstruction framework. Thus the present work proposes a way to improve the time efficiency of HARDI, and shows its application to the computation of a new HARDI-based contrast which has a potential to improve the clinical value of this important imaging modality.","","978-1-4673-0354-5","10.1109/MMBIA.2012.6164765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164765","","Image reconstruction;Noise;Magnetic resonance imaging;Rician channels;Noise measurement;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Optimization","biodiffusion;biomedical MRI;brain;compressed sensing;image coding;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sampling;medical image processing","compressed sensing;high angular resolution diffusion imaging;white matter;brain;diffusion-encoded image;diffusion-encoding gradient;HARDI data reconstruction;Rician statistics;measurement noise;rotational invariant Fourier signatures;colour-HARDI;in-vivo MRI data;CS-based reconstruction framework;HARDI-based contrast;imaging modality","","1","","22","","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Flow quantification in 2D+t DCE-US is generally performed by averaging the signal in large regions of analysis (ROAs), followed by the regression of a parametric model to the obtained echo-power versus time curves. However, this approach can lead to a loss of spatial information about the microvascular flow distribution throughout the tumor if this distribution is spatially heterogeneous. This work adapts a clustering algorithm (DynClust) developed previously for evaluation of contrast-enhanced computed tomography to DCE-US data. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm are assessed on a bi-compartmental simulated data set, the relevance of the identified perfusion clusters is assessed on DCE-US acquisition in murine kidneys. Its capacity to detect differences between a group of 27 mice treated with placebo and a group of 20 mice treated with an anti-angiogenic is assessed. The number of clusters Kclust derived from the clustering clustering algorithm are related to the heterogenity of the perfusion in the tumour.

Today, screen reading software and Braille displays or text-to-speech systems have solved many problems of accessing text. For accessing graphics, and specifically digital graphics, there is to date no standardised technology that is accepted and used by blind people. Especially in school education, access to pictures is almost impossible to master; making teamwork very complicated and thus isolating blind students from their sighted peers making it impossible to acquire a shared understanding of school material. Focusing on geometry, which is believed to be the main theory of space, is very crucial for non-sighted students to develop an accurate spatial sense and reasoning.

These artifacts typically appear as black bands covering parts of the image and they severely degrade the image quality. In this paper, we present a fast two-step algorithm for estimating the unknowns in the signal model and removing the banding artifacts. The first step consists of rewriting the model in such a way that it becomes linear in the unknowns (this step is named Linearization for Off-Resonance Estimation, or LORE). In the second step, we use a Gauss-Newton iterative optimization with the parameters obtained by LORE as initial guesses. We name the full algorithm LORE-GN.

The effects of HTO during dynamic activities, e.g., gait, however, is unclear considering the fact that it also affects the tensions of the knee ligaments and hence the knee configuration under external load and knee flexion. In this study, the HTO was simulated on a detailed 3D model of the knee consisting of femur, tibia, cartilage layer, menisci, and four ligaments. The geometry of the model was acquired from the CT and MRI data of a volunteer and the mechanical properties of the model components were obtained from the literature. In total, 42 simulations were conducted in ABAQUS to observe the effects of the correction angle and the posterior tibial slope on the tensions of the ligaments. Results indicated that the ACL tension is highly affected by both the correction angle and the posterior slope. The ACL force was minimal with the optimal wedge-angle and a small slope. LCL force decreased significantly following HTO, but showed a slight increase for smaller slopes. The PCL force, on the other hand, increased slightly following HTO and with smaller posterior slopes. It was concluded that the most important effect of the HTO and posterior slope on the knee ligaments is that of the ACL. Care should be taken to perform the surgery with optimum correction angle, to pass the mechanical axis through the center of the knee joint, and at the same time keep the posterior slope sufficiently small, beyond 10 degrees.","","978-0-7381-2412-4","10.1109/ICBME51989.2020.9319433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319433","open-wedge;correction angle;tibia slope;ACL;PCL;MCL;LCL","Ligaments;Knee;Surgery;Force;Stress;Solid modeling;Bones","biomechanics;biomedical MRI;bone;finite element analysis;injuries;orthopaedics;surgery","knee configuration;varus knees;articular cartilage;tibial osteotomy;finite element study;knee ligamentous forces;knee joint;optimum correction angle;knee ligaments;PCL force;LCL force;ACL force;posterior slope;ACL tension;posterior tibial slope;cartilage layer","","","","24","","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ErrP signals are particularly useful for robotics tasks because they are naturally occurring within the brain in response to an unexpected error. We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classification performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for realtime closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as offline analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened.

For example, direct mechanical measurements on human prostate show up to a threefold increase in Young's modulus over a 10% deformation. In conventional elasticity imaging, these effects produce strain-dependent elastic contrast. Ignoring these effects generally leads to suboptimal contrast (stiffer tissues at lower strain are contrasted against softer tissues at higher strain), but measuring the nonlinear behavior results in enhanced tissue differentiation. To demonstrate the methods extracting nonlinear elastic properties, both simulations and measurements were performed on an agar-gelatin phantom. Multiple frames of phase-sensitive ultrasound data are acquired as the phantom is deformed by 12%. All interframe displacement data are brought back to the geometry of the first frame to form a three-dimensional (3-D) data set (depth, lateral, and preload dimensions). Data are fit to a 3-D second order polynomial model for each pixel that adjusts for deformation irregularities. For the phantom geometry and elastic properties considered in this paper, reconstructed frame-to-frame strain images using this model result in improved contrast to noise ratios (CNR) at all preload levels, without any sacrifice in spatial resolution. From the same model, strain hardening at all preload levels can be extracted. This is an independent contrast mechanism. Its maximum CNR occurs at 5.13% preload, and it is a 54% improvement over the best case (preload 10.6%) CNR for frame-to-frame strain reconstruction. Actual phantom measurements confirm the essential features of the simulation. Results show that modeling of the nonlinear elastic behavior has the potential to both increase detectability in elasticity imaging and provide a new independent mechanism for tissue differentiation.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1320826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320826","","Elasticity;Imaging phantoms;Strain measurement;Capacitive sensors;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Geometry;Image reconstruction;Mechanical variables measurement;Anthropometry;Humans","biomedical ultrasonics;ultrasonic imaging;Young's modulus","Young's modulus;tissue;strain-dependent elastic contrast;agar-gelatin phantom;phase-sensitive ultrasound data;3D second order polynomial model;contrast to noise ratios;strain hardening;nonlinear elastic behavior","Algorithms;Anisotropy;Connective Tissue;Connective Tissue;Elasticity;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Nonlinear Dynamics;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stress, Mechanical;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","12","","20","","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the standard configuration for current clinical MPI is L-mode with two detectors ~90° apart. This study aims to design a dual-head L-mode MPH collimator for potential stationary MPI based on a clinical SPECT/CT scanner. Two stationary L-mode configurations, L-mode-I/II, were proposed based on the work of Rittenbach et al. where the long axis of the left ventricle was perpendicular to either camera. With the pre-defined pinhole pattern with minimal projection truncation and <;20% multiplexing, maximum packing density and detector usage, the optimized MPH collimator parameters including pinhole number, radius-of-rotation, collimator length, aperture size and acceptance angle were determined by maximizing the sensitivity based on the pre-determined field-of-view of 20 cm and target resolution of 1 cm, considering the physical constraints of L-mode-I/II. Analytical simulations using the 4D extended cardiac-torso phantom (XCAT) were performed for 4 selected MPH designs with superior sensitivity results. Noise-free and noisy projections were generated and reconstructed using 3D MPH OS-EM algorithm. Reconstructed images were evaluated by visual assessment, normalized-mean-square-error (NMSE) and normalized standard deviation (NSD). L-mode-II generally showed less NMSE as compared to L-mode-I. For L-mode-I, 11-pinhole had the best NMSE-NSD trade-off while for L-mode-II, 18-pinhole had the best trade-off. We concluded that stationary MPI acquisition by using a dual-head MPH collimator is feasible and has the potential for dynamic MPI.","1082-3654","978-1-4799-0534-8","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829215","","Collimators;Detectors;Image reconstruction;Single photon emission computed tomography;Sensitivity;Noise measurement","biomedical MRI;collimators;image reconstruction;medical image processing;phantoms;single photon emission computed tomography","dual head multipinhole collimator design;stationary clinical myocardial perfusion imaging;MPH collimator;clinical MPI;gamma camera;SPECT-CT scanner;maximum packing density;target resolution;4D extended cardiac-torso phantom;4D XCAT;3D MPH OS-EM algorithm;reconstructed images","","","","5","","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, being different from the generalized Bradley-Terry model for group competition used in Elo rating algorithm, Only-One-Victor model in our work simulates the process of making selection from a set of possible candidates by considering such process as a group of independent pairwise comparisons. We use a graph theory model to prove the correctness of Only-One-Victor model. In addition, we also apply the Minorization-Maximization (MM) to solve the optimization task. Therefore, our algorithm still enjoys many computational advantages of Elo rating algorithm, such as the scalability with high dimensional feature space.

Processing the recorded high-dimensional neural data can take a large amount of time when performed on general-purpose computers. Methods: In this paper, an FPGA-based real-time spike sorting system is presented which takes into account the spatial correlation between the electrical signals recorded with closely-packed recording sites to cluster multi-channel neural data. The system uses a spatial window-based version of the Online Sorting algorithm, which uses unsupervised template-matching for clustering. Results: The test results show that the proposed system can reach an average accuracy of 86% using simulated data (16-32 neurons, 4-10 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio), while the single-channel clustering version achieves only 74% average accuracy in the same cases on a 128-channel electrode array. The developed system was also tested on in vivo cortical recordings obtained from an anesthetized rat. Conclusion: The proposed FPGA-based spike sorting system can process more than 11000 spikes/second, so it can be used during in vivo experiments providing real-time feedback on the location and electrophysiological properties of well-separable single units.

In its practice, some systematic biases have been associated with ultrasound frequencies, focal depths and configuration, and transducer types (linear versus curvilinear), along with displacement estimation and shear wave speed estimation algorithms. Added to that, soft tissues are not purely elastic, so shear waves will travel at different speeds depending on their spectral content, which can be modulated by the acoustic radiation force (ARF) excitation focusing, duration, and the frequency-dependent stiffness of the tissue. To understand how these different acquisition and material property parameters may affect the measurements of shear wave velocity, the simulations of the propagation of shear waves generated by ARF excitations in viscoelastic media are a very important tool. This paper serves to provide an in-depth description of how these simulations are performed. The general scheme is broken into three components: 1) simulation of the 3-D ARF push beam; 2) applying that force distribution to a finite-element model; and 3) extraction of the motion data for post-processing. All three components will be described in detail and combined to create a simulation platform that is powerful for developing and testing algorithms for academic and industrial researchers involved in making quantitative shear-wave-based measurements of tissue material properties.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2641299","RSNA QIBA Ultrasound Shear Wave Speed Committee; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792721","Elastic;finite-element model (FEM);shear wave;ultrasound;viscoelastic","Force;Acoustics;Ultrasonic imaging;Material properties;Media;Transducers;Finite element analysis","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;finite element analysis;ultrasonic imaging","finite element modeling;acoustic radiation force induced shear wave propagation;tissue mimicking media;ultrasound shear wave elastography;displacement estimation;ARF excitation focusing","Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Models, Biological;Phantoms, Imaging","28","","75","","21 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accidents of unmanned aircraft are often related to deficiencies in the design of the human machine interface. Many of these deficiencies are a consequence of insufficient consideration of human factors engineering principles in the early stages of system development. Therefore, in the design of the current human machine interface, empirically validated human factors methods were applied in order to optimally support a remote pilot in supervising and guiding multiple highly automated unmanned aircraft. An information management concept was developed that allows for an increase in the number of UAS that are being supervised without considerably increasing display complexity. In order to evaluate the human machine interface, two within-subj ect simulation studies were conducted. In both studies, pilots were asked to supervise and guide a varying number of UAS in several experimental scenarios using the new human machine interface. Following the experimental scenarios, a structured interview regarding the design of the human machine interface was conducted. The objective of the first study was to gather initial data on the general usability of the interface. The aim of the second simulation study was to investigate how increasing the number of UAS from one up to five affects the time that a pilot needs to acquire and change specific system parameters of any UAS under supervision. Further, the impact of increasing the number of UAS on pilot workload and situation awareness was assessed. The results of the interviews suggest that the design concept of the human machine interface is feasible and easy to understand. The information management concept was described as reasonable and logical. Important information was accessible quickly and (critical) system states could easily be identified. No significant effects of increasing the number of UASs to be supervised on reaction, workload or situation awareness were observed. The findings suggest that the information management concept is reasonable and usable.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081645","unmanned aircraft systems;ground control station;human machine interface","","autonomous aerial vehicles;human factors;information management;man-machine systems","UAS;human factors engineering principles;human machine interface;automated unmanned aircraft;unmanned aircraft accident;information management;situation awareness","","","","20","","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the acceleration factor of CS is constant, which results in difficulties in precisely observing and/or measuring dynamic ventilation process due to bifurcating network structure of the lung. Here, an adaptive strategy is proposed to highly undersample pulmonary HP dynamic k-space data, according to the characteristics of both lung structure and gas motion. After that, a valid reconstruction algorithm is developed to reconstruct dynamic MR images, considering the low-rank, global sparsity, gas-inflow effects, and joint sparsity.

This coordinate system is independent of the imaging catheter, and consequently referencing to this frame removes artifacts associated with probe motion within the balloon during deformation. Displacements and strains estimated by phase-sensitive correlation-based speckle tracking were used to distinguish arterial plaques in simulated coronary arteries of differing elastic moduli: hard, soft, and homogenous.

As a result, speckle noise reduction is an important prerequisite, whenever ultrasound imaging is used for tissue characterization. Among the many methods that have been proposed to perform this task, there exists a class of approaches that use a multiplicative model of speckled image formation and take advantage of the logarithmical transformation in order to convert multiplicative speckle noise into additive noise. The common assumption made in a dominant number of such studies is that the samples of the additive noise are mutually uncorrelated and obey a Gaussian distribution. The present study shows conceptually and experimentally that this assumption is oversimplified and unnatural. Moreover, it may lead to inadequate performance of the speckle reduction methods. The study introduces a simple preprocessing procedure, which modifies the acquired radio-frequency images (without affecting the anatomical information they contain), so that the noise in the log-transformation domain becomes very close in its behavior to a white Gaussian noise. As a result, the preprocessing allows filtering methods based on assuming the noise to be white and Gaussian, to perform in nearly optimal conditions. The study evaluates performances of three different, nonlinear filters - wavelet denoising, total variation filtering, and anisotropic diffusion - and demonstrates that, in all these cases, the proposed preprocessing significantly improves the quality of resultant images. Our numerical tests include a series of computer-simulated and in vivo experiments.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1588392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1588392","","Biomedical imaging;Ultrasonic imaging;Speckle;Noise reduction;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Medical diagnostic imaging;Filtering;Image resolution;Image converters","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;medical image processing;image denoising;AWGN;nonlinear filters","image despeckle;medical ultrasound images;speckle noise reduction;image resolution;image contrast;tissue characterization;logarithmical transformation;additive noise;Gaussian distribution;radio-frequency images;log-transformation domain;white Gaussian noise;filtering methods;nonlinear filters;wavelet denoising;total variation filtering;anisotropic diffusion","Algorithms;Artifacts;Carotid Arteries;Echocardiography;Echocardiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","233","4","50","","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When addressing this problem with synthetic modeling, the conventional idea prevalent in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, generally, is to assume hybrid systems and corresponding neural network models, where higher order cognition is realized by means of symbolic representation and lower sensory-motor processes by analog processing. However, the crucial problem with such approaches is that the symbols represented at higher order cognitive levels cannot be grounded naturally in sensory-motor reality. The former are defined in a discrete space without any metric, and the latter are defined in a continuous space with a physical metric. These, therefore, cannot directly interact with each other, regardless of the interface that is assigned between them. The proposal in the current paper is to reconstruct higher order cognition by means of continuous neurodynamic systems that can elaborate delicate interactions with the sensory-motor level while sharing the same metric space. Our neurorobotics experiments-including language-action associations and the learning of goal-directed actions-show that the compositionality necessary for higher order cognitive tasks can be acquired by means of self-organizing dynamic structures, via interactive learning between the top-down intentional process of acting on the physical world and the bottom-up recognition of perceptual reality. Using robotic simulations, the current paper demonstrates that nonlinear dynamic phenomena, such as bifurcations and the chaotic dynamics induced by unstable fixed points, could play essential roles in realizing higher order functions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2308604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775263","Chaos;cognition;compositionality;dynamical systems;neural network models;neurorobotics;self-organization;sensory-motor systems","Robot sensing systems;Predictive models;Brain models;Cognitive science;Recurrent neural networks;Self-organizing networks","brain;cognition;intelligent control;intelligent robots;medical robotics;mobile robots;neurophysiology","self-organization;cognitive brains;neurorobotics;artificial intelligence;hybrid systems;neural network models;symbolic representation;sensory-motor processes;analog processing;discrete space;continuous neurodynamic systems;language-action associations;self-organizing dynamic structures;interactive learning;robotic simulations;nonlinear dynamic phenomena;bifurcations;chaotic dynamics;perceptual reality","","22","","72","","19 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in order to provide temperature updates with very short latency times, fast MR acquisition schemes are usually employed, which in turn might lead to noisy temperature measurements. This will, in general, have a direct impact on therapy control and endpoint detection. In this paper, we address this problem through an improved non-local filtering technique applied on the temperature images. Compared with previous non-local filtering methods, the proposed approach considers not only spatial information but also exploits temporal redundancies. The method is fully automatic and designed to improve the precision of the temperature measurements while at the same time maintaining output accuracy. In addition, the implementation was optimized in order to ensure real-time availability of the temperature measurements while having a minimal impact on latency. The method was validated in three complementary experiments: a simulation, an ex-vivo and an in-vivo study. Compared to the original non-local means filter and two other previously employed temperature filtering methods, the proposed approach shows considerable improvement in both accuracy and precision of the filtered data. Together with the low computational demands of the numerical scheme, the proposed filtering technique shows great potential for improving temperature measurements during real-time MR thermometry dedicated to targeted thermal therapies.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2627221","Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen; European Research Council, Sound Pharma; ITEA 2 under Project SoRTS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859365","Image denoising;MR-thermometry;Real-time system","Temperature measurement;Noise measurement;Real-time systems;Medical treatment;Temperature distribution;Noise reduction;Signal to noise ratio","adaptive filters;biomedical MRI;biothermics;image denoising;image filtering;medical image processing;radiation therapy;temperature measurement","adaptive nonlocal-means filter;real-time MR-thermometry;proton resonance frequency shift-based magnetic resonance thermometry;targeted thermal therapies;MR acquisition schemes;noisy temperature measurements;therapy control;endpoint detection;improved nonlocal filtering technique;temperature images;nonlocal filtering methods;spatial information;temporal redundancies;original nonlocal means filter;temperature filtering method","Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Temperature;Thermometry","7","","27","","20 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Undersampling a transducer array usually results in a significant increase in imaging artifacts, caused primarily by higher grating lobe (GL) levels. Thus, state-of-the-art sparse arrays design strategies focus on avoiding GLs, while compromising on the resulting image resolution and uniformity. In this work, we investigated the applicability of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image reconstruction, having recently proven its potential in reducing GL artifacts, for reconstructing images from single unfocused acquisitions using uniformly undersampled linear array configurations on receive. The proposed reconstruction method consists of first computing a low-quality estimate from the undersampled single-shot acquisitions using a delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm, followed by applying a real-time-capable CNN, trained specifically to reduce diffraction artifacts. Experiments were conducted within a simulation environment, in the context of plane wave imaging on a numerical test phantom dedicated to US image quality assessment. The proposed approach achieved an image comparable or better to that obtained from conventional DAS beamforming using the full array with uniformly undersampled arrays up to a factor of three, demonstrating a promising potential for sparse array imaging in general.","1948-5727","978-1-7281-5448-0","10.1109/IUS46767.2020.9251442","Swiss National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251442","Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;grating lobes;image reconstruction;image restoration;sparse arrays;ultrafast ultrasound imaging","Image quality;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging;Image restoration;Arrays;Convolutional neural networks;Image reconstruction","biomedical ultrasonics;convolutional neural nets;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sampling;medical image processing;phantoms;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic transducer arrays","single-shot CNN-based ultrasound imaging;sparse linear arrays;energy consumption;data transfer requirements;transducer array;imaging artifacts;sparse array design;image resolution;convolutional neural network-based image reconstruction;GL artifacts;reconstruction method;single-shot acquisitions;real-time-capable CNN;diffraction artifacts;plane wave imaging;image quality assessment;image comparable;sparse array imaging;undersampled linear array configurations","","","","9","","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proceedings","6 Aug 2002","1996","2","","1197","1200 vol.2","More and more advanced algorithms are being introduced for performing signal and image processing on medical ultrasound signals. The algorithms often use the RF ultrasound signal and perform adaptive signal processing. Two examples are the cross-correlation estimator for blood velocity estimation and adaptive blind deconvolution. The first algorithm uses the RF signal from a number of pulse emissions and correlates segments within different pulse-echo lines to obtain a velocity estimate. Real-time processing makes it necessary to perform around 600 million multiplications and additions per second for this algorithm. This has until now only been possible by using the sign of the signals, and such an implementation does not give optimal performance. The second algorithm also uses the RF data, and first performs an estimation of the one-dimensional pulse in the tissue as a function of depth. Then a Kalman filter is used with a second time-reversed recursive estimation step. Here it is necessary to perform about 70 arithmetic operations per RF sample or about 1 billion operations per second for real-time deconvolution. Furthermore, these have to be floating point operations due to the adaptive nature of the algorithms. Many of the algorithms can only be properly evaluated in a clinical setting with real-time processing, which generally cannot be done with conventional equipment. This paper therefore presents a multi-processor system capable of performing 1.2 billion floating point operations per second on RF ultrasound signals. It consists of 16 ADSP 21060 processors each capable of 80 Mflops. Four processors are placed on one board with 24 MBytes external storage and an internal storage of 0.5 MBytes per processor. All processors can access all storage on its physical board, and are further connected through parallel interface channels. Each channel can transmit 40 MBytes a second without slowing the processor down, and each processor has 6 of these channels. Four of these are accessible through front panel connectors, so that an almost arbitrary network of the 16 processors can be made. The system has been interfaced to our previously-developed real-time sampling system that can acquire RF data at a rate of 20 MHz and simultaneously transmit the data at 20 MHz to the processing system via several parallel channels. These two systems can, thus, perform real-time processing of ultrasound data. The advantage of the system is its generous input/output bandwidth, that makes it easy to balance the computational load between the processors and prevents data starvation. Due to the use of floating point calculations it is possible to simulate all types of signal processing in modem ultrasound scanners, and this system is, thus, a complete software scanner. The system has been connected to a B and K Medical type 3535 ultrasound scanner. Data is received by the PC through an Analog Devices EZ-LAB card with a ADSP21062 processor.","1051-0117","0-7803-3615-1","10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.584205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=584205","","Real time systems;Deconvolution;Signal processing algorithms;Ultrasonic imaging;Radio frequency;Signal processing;RF signals;Image processing;Biomedical imaging;Adaptive signal processing","multiprocessing systems;real-time systems;biomedical ultrasonics;medical image processing;adaptive signal processing;blood flow measurement","multiprocessor system;real-time deconvolution;flow estimation;medical ultrasound;advanced algorithms;RF ultrasound signal;cross-correlation estimator;blood velocity estimation;adaptive blind deconvolution;pulse-echo lines;Kalman filter;time-reversed recursive estimation step;arithmetic operations;floating point operations;20 MHz;24 MByte;80 MFLOPS","","2","4","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Vessel segmentation using 3D elastica regularization","N. Y. El-Zehiry; L. Grady","Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA; Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA","2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","12 Jul 2012","2012","","","1288","1291","Vascular diseases are among the most important health problems. Vessel segmentation is a very critical task for stenosis measurement and simulation, diagnosis and treatment planning. However, vessel segmentation is much more challenging than blob-like object segmentation due to the thin elongated anatomy of the blood vessels, which can easily appear disconnected in the acquired images due to noise and occlusion. In this paper, we present a generic vessel segmentation approach that extracts the vessels by globally minimizing the surface curvature. The low curvature model enforces surface continuity and prevents the formation of false positives (leakages) and false negatives (holes). We present two contributions: First, we introduce a generic 3D vessel segmentation model by penalizing the boundary surface curvature. Second, we introduce an attraction force as a generalization of the boundary length in the elastica model, which guarantees a complete global solution and avoids shrinkage bias of length regularization. Our results will illustrate that the approach works efficiently across different acquisition modalities and for different applications.","1945-8452","978-1-4577-1858-8","10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6235798","Segmentation;Vessel Segmentation;Combinatorial Optimization;Curvature;Graph Methods","Image segmentation;Optimization;Force;Data models;Active contours;Lattices;Blood vessels","biomedical MRI;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;computerised tomography;diseases;image segmentation;medical image processing","generic 3D vessel segmentation model;3D elastica regularization;vascular diseases;health problems;stenosis measurement;treatment planning;blood vessels;acquired images;surface continuity;curvature model;boundary surface curvature;attraction force;boundary length;elastica model;shrinkage bias","","5","","12","","12 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The intensity inhomogeneity, which is also known as bias field or intensity non-uniformity, may arise due to erroneous acquire process causes severe image degradation. The retrospective methods are capable of correcting intensity nonuniformity and are widely applied to both simulated and real MR volumes. The polynomial surface fitting based retrospective intensity correction technique works on the assumption that the large homogeneous tissues (e.g. Gray matter, white matter, etc.) are distributed throughout the image so that a parametric polynomial based surface can be fitted on image features to estimate the intensity inhomogeneity map. The image features which contain information about intensity inhomogeneity are generally image intensity values or intensity gradient values. The bias field, which is characterized as a slow varying function, is further used to obtain the corrected image. The quantitative evaluation of the correction strategy is done by comparing the standard deviation between input and output images which is expected to be reduced in principle tissues. Simulation results on synthetic MR images show that the proposed method can eliminate intensity inhomogeneity quite satisfactorily.","","978-1-4244-9799-7","10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5739347","MR images;intensity inhomogeneity;retrospective correction","Nonhomogeneous media;Biomedical imaging","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;medical image processing;polynomial approximation;surface fitting","parametric polynomial surface fitting;retrospective correction;intensity inhomogeneity;magnetic resonance images;MRI;image degradation;gray matter;white matter;tissues;image correction","","2","","7","","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Field Inhomogeneity Correction Based on Gridding Reconstruction for Magnetic Resonance Imaging","H. Eggers; T. Knopp; D. Potts","Philips Res. Eur., Hamburg; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","26 Feb 2007","2007","26","3","374","384","Spatial variations of the main field give rise to artifacts in magnetic resonance images if disregarded in reconstruction. With non-Cartesian k-space sampling, they often lead to unacceptable blurring. Data from such acquisitions are usually reconstructed with gridding methods and optionally restored with various correction methods. Both types of methods essentially face the same basic problem of adequately approximating an exponential function to enable an efficient processing with fast Fourier transforms. Nevertheless, they have commonly addressed it differently so far. In the present work, a unified approach is pursued. The principle behind gridding methods is first generalized to nonequispaced sampling in both domains and then applied to field inhomogeneity correction. Three new algorithms, which are compatible with a direct conjugate phase and an iterative algebraic reconstruction, are derived in this way from a straightforward embedding of the data into a higher dimensional space. Their evaluation in simulations and phantom experiments with spiral k-space sampling shows that one of them promises to provide a favorable compromise between fidelity and complexity compared with existing algorithms. Moreover, it allows a simple choice of key parameters involved in approximating an exponential function and a balance between the accuracy of reconstruction and correction","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.891502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4114551","Conjugate phase reconstruction;field inhomogeneity;gridding;image reconstruction;iterative reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging;off-resonance correction;spiral imaging","Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Sampling methods;Iterative algorithms;Magnetic resonance;Image sampling;Image restoration;Face;Fast Fourier transforms;Imaging phantoms","biomedical MRI;image reconstruction;iterative methods;medical image processing;phantoms","field inhomogeneity correction;gridding reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging;nonequispaced sampling;direct conjugate phase;iterative algebraic reconstruction;phantom;spiral k-space sampling","Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Scattering, Radiation;Sensitivity and Specificity","33","","22","","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

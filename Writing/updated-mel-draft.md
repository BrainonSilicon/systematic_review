# Learning to learn in Virtual Reality 


# Introduction


Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology defined by the ability to build and experience a computer generated world and is now synonymous with the head-mounted-displays from Oculus, HTC, Microsoft, and many other commercial ventures. 

There is a increasing level of interest in using VR technologies as a training tool for  

* train pilots, surgeons, and teach people anything from mathematics, surgery, race car assembly, to how to fly a plane (****)
* and military sim (…, Bossard, Kermarrec, Buche, & Tisseau, 2008 ; Holden, 2005), For training nurses, training pilots, practice and assessment of laparoscopic surgery, the education of chemistry and electrical engineering concepts and geography, as well as various sports.
* While this interest may stem from a Matrix-born ‘I know Kung-Fu’ hope, there is a profound danger in using Virtual Reality as a training medium if what you learn in VR does not transfer to the real “Natural” world.

**Without clarity and knowledge of if, how, and under what conditions newly acquired skills will transfer; VR may not be an appropriate medium for training. This is of particular concern when VR is being used as a substitute training environment for highly dangerous situations such as the training of surgeons, nuclear powerplant engineers, and emergency services().**

The enclosed transfer report details a 5 stage project that is proposed to investigate the conditions that support the transfer of learning from Virtual Reality to Reality.

# **A Note on Terminology**

The literature on VR transfer studies have used the term ‘VR’ to describe a wide range of technologies (Smith, ). The shared element of all these technologies is the 

A deeper analysis and summary of these will be entered into my final dissertation, however for the purposes of this transfer report, the separation between HMD based VR (HMD-VR) and other VR technologies will be made. The acronym ‘VR’ will be used as an umbrella term to describe the range of virtual reality technologies used to present computer generated stimuli that users may interact with, and the term Natural will be used to denote the ‘real world’. 

Learning rate refers to the rate of skill acquisition and/or relative changes in performance over time. 


# Background
> Critically review existing relevant literature, show what is lacking with the present state of knowledge (i.e. demonstrate how your work critically investigates the topic).

* the lack of coherence in how to study such a technology (Molier et al., 2010).
> Sentence saying why I’m focused on skill learning 

Transfer of Learning exists from its constituents 
Transfer of Learning inherently has two constituent parts
* Learning
* And a transfer of that learning out of the context it was acquired 

In order to address transfer of learning, we have to assess each part. 


### What is learning
Learning is typically defined as a relatively permanent change in a person’s capability to perform a skill (Schmidt & Lee, 2005).

### What is a skill?
I am defining skill by 1) something not known prior/something new, 2) able to be measured, 3) able to be improved through training (Adams, 1987)

Some work has indicated that there is an equivalence in terms of complex skill learning between the real and simulated environments (Alicea, 2020) however previous reviews have struggled to produce conclusive results due to wide variation in technologies that claim the name “VR” and


#### VR Skill acquisition has been assessed in x way - how we learn a skill in VR
- Anglin 
- Harris/Buckingham 
- 
How we learn in VR (strategy) Anglin & Liew ⚠️ to add 2-3 studies to this section ⚠️

(Anglin et al., 2017) Focused their investigation of sensorimotor learning by looking at visuomotor adaptation wherein a participant learns or “adapts” to a perturbation introduced by the experimenters in order to correctly perform a movement (Krakauer, 2009). Similar to how a sharp shooter will have to learn the rigged weighting of a carnival target practice game in order to win the prize. The study had participants sitting at a desk viewing a computer screen in Virtual Reality and in Natural. The study’s aims were to investigate a visuomotor adaptation and compare the strategies and adaptation acquired in VR compared with the same task in Natural. Implicit and explicit strategy and VR and Natural Participants in both VR and Natural required the same time to adapt to the perturbation and reduce their errors for the task indicating that Training block, baseline, rotation, block where participants did not receive visual feedback, then washout n=24 (12 per group), participants were not requested to report on their previous VR experience Hmd group felt difference with the quality of the interface statistically significant difference (p=0.064) This will be discussed later

No significant difference in reaction time No significant different in early or late adaption, or aftereffect (also called washout) which is the effect that having learnt the adaptation has on a non-perturbed movement (similar to the colloquial experience of “sea-legs” after sailors return to land).

Anglin and colleagues found no significant difference in the pure performance of the task in that The aiming angle was larger in the VR group compared to the natural group The same target error

HMD-VR participants utilized a greater cognitive strategy than CT participants, and CT participants engaged in greater implicit learning than HMD-VR participants Participants were able to adapt to perturbations in regardless of the medium Suggested that the implicit adaptation acquired in VR may not generalize

Criticism of the Anglin and Liew task Habituation to VR Mentioned this and how this may have contributed to the use of a cognitive or “explicit” strategy Comfort may impact task performance Visual acuity IPD and contrast Ocular dominance Also just a computer screen task ** NOTE Loop in Gavin’s paper and Saijo & Gomi, 2010 - how we use multiple strategies

**_Gavin’s Paper_**
golf simulator 

ergonomic and biomechanical fidelity (Harris et al., 2019) - does it allow for realistic motor movements - comparison between motor amplitude and speed, or joint between a real and a computer created task

The acquisition of a skill, and then performance of that skill beyond its training environment owes its foundations to Psychology’s First law of ‘the ability to learn in one context, and demonstrate what was learnt to a novel one’ (Shepard, 1987). Where Shepard’s definition discusses the generalization of learning in a cognitive sense, contemporary motor learning researchers differentiate between 
* Generalization  
* And Transfer of Learning 

To this extent Transfer of Learning (ToL) can be defined as the gain (or loss) in the capability for performance of one task as a result of practice on some other task (Schmidt and Lee, 1982). 
* The ‘task’ difference is the Natural vs VR 

The literature on VR is dominated by research on transfer of learning in the areas of education, rehabilitation, organizational management, and surgery (***) 
* as the effectiveness of a simulator is defined by its ability to teach skills that transfer to the real world (Gopher, 2012).


## **Transfer of Learning and Skill**

Transfer of learning (ToL) between virtual and real has been demonstrated in sports (Gray, 2017; 2019; Neumann et al., 2018), laparoscopic surgery, rehabilitation (Adamovich et al., 2009), and a handful of visuomotor tasks (*****). 

### Sports
**Gray, 2017** CAVE with the addition of a handheld actual bat (with tracking sensor attached) - Batters received visual, auditory, and tactile feedback during the movement and at the conclusion of their movement regarding the success of their swing

1. Adaptive training in a batting VE, (ii) extra sessions of batting practice in the VE, (iii) extra on-field sessions of real batting practice, and (iv) a control condition involving no additional training to the players’ regular practice.

pre-test (2x45min)x6 weeks | 2 weeks buffer post-test. Retention tests 1mo after post-test as well as a 5 year post experiment follow up which captured the progression of the player’s career and batting statistics So it was a study that indicated adaptive training administered in a VE was the most effective training the results can most likely be attributed to the fact that the training was designed in a way to challenge the players (it was stepwise) rather than because it was administered in VR


### Rehabilitation
- stroke rehab 
- DMD 
- CP

 - [Ravi, Kumar, & Singhi, 2017](https://scite.ai/reports/effectiveness-of-virtual-reality-rehabilitation-rvaORV) 

 A 2010 study looked at the effect of VR with haptic feedback from movement on gait and balance, in stroke participants (Mirelman, et. al. 2010). The trainings for both groups consisted on 3 weekly, 1 hour sessions, for 4 weeks. Both groups received identical movement trainings based around dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, eversion, and combination movements; the non-VR group completed these movements at the instruction of a trainer whereas the VR group manipulated a virtually presented boat or plane towards a target. Results post analysis showed the VR group reporting greater improvement, and at faster rates, across multiple different measures. In all measures, the VR group showed significantly superior improvement, which was consistent with previous literature (Reid et. al., 2002; 2005; 2007).

Mirelmen conducted a follow up study using a CAVE (a reflexive acronym used to describe a 4 walled ‘room’ that constitutes ‘VR’ due to the projection of an environment that is viewed through glasses using alternating shutters thus allowing projections to appear ‘3D’). The study investigated the efficacy of VR on gait training and motor learning in patients with Parkinson’s (Mirelman et. al., 2011). The study found a 31% improvement in all motor and gait tasks, and a significant improvement at specific tasks that were reported four times larger than the threshold for significance.These results were persistent as found in a 1 month follow up.

VR was used by Bryanton and colleagues (2006) to assess the efficacy of using VR in motor rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. The use of the VE was to provide an engaging task, “gamifying” the rehabilitation to aid with rehabilitation protocol adherence, while also investigating the efficacy of VR to ensure exercise “correctness” which would allow for children to complete their rehabilitation at home, thus lower costs and barriers to accessing therapists. Same rehab exercises VRE reported more fun and higher interest/engagement completion of the exercises with greater correctness (as determined by the length of time held in dorsiflexion) VR participants reached a greater range of motion on average than the non-VR groups

The literature supports VR at home (for rehab) but can that be done with validity? 
- VEs that can be individualized—for example, by replicating the users’ home environment or modifying stimulus presentation according to user needs and capabilities—should enhance transfer and generalization of learning (Schultheis & Rizzo, 2001). 
- A study on balance (static, against perturbation, and goal directed movements), gait training, and yoga training using VR with Parkinson's patients did not find any difference between the effectiveness of the ‘home-based’ VR training compared to traditional ‘not in VR’ home training. All measures were rated equally in improving balance, walking, and quality of life. (Yang et al., 2016)

 
### Surgical Training
As surgical training and assessment is not the focus of the project - would not be able to contribute past the extensive systematic reviews that have been done

Extensive systematic reviews have been conducted

# Current Work

A systematic review has been in progress to catalogue 
Put the methods and findings to date 

> Explain how there is confusion and therefore project originality (maybe mention FIFA if there is space) 


## Outline the gaps and Project originality
> to provide evidence of project originality. this part goes at the end of the background section and intro the project originality defense part 
> Introduce project and show how it should help to address the deficiencies of other work (i.e. demonstrate how you evaluate your approved topic).

Despite the breadth of simulation and VR literature, research on modern virtual reality technologies is sparse. 
* There is a wealth of historic and contemporary literature on non-HMD-VR that assess transfer of learning. And yet HMDs are ubiquitous with vr training in industry

Anglin et al., 2017 used HMD however * did not investigate Habituation to VR * despite Mentioning how habituation or the novelty of experiencing VR may have caused the difference in strategies reported from the results. * and how this may have contributed to the use of a cognitive or “explicit” strategy * Comfort may impact task performance * Visual acuity * IPD and contrast * Ocular dominance * Also just a computer screen task * ** NOTE Loop in Gavin’s paper and Saijo & Gomi, 2010 - how we use multiple strategies

The HMD literature is largely focused on rehabilitation applications _Majority of literature in HMD-VR is focused on rehabilitation and has been conducted on impaired or non-normative populations._
* Undermining the conclusions we may draw to normative populations (citation)

Of the existing literature there is
* Cite the sys review that had 1 paper left 
* Cite the other sys reviews 
is largely conflicting on if VR training will transfer - systematic reviews are inconclusive

Current theories cite the 
- differing technologies (Molier et al., 2010)(Smith, 2019) 
- differing study design that does not allow for meta-analysis or comparison of results - poor control conditions 
- small sample sizes the differing technological affordances 
- fidelity differences are to blame for the torn literature high-fidelity interaction techniques usually outperform mid-fidelity techniques the second common result was that low-fidelity interaction techniques also usually outperform mid-fidelity techniques. U-shaped curve in terms of user performance Similar to the uncanny valley of robotics 
    - other support for FIFA - Ilgen, Sherbino, & Cook., 2013 

A framework (based on McMahan et al. 2016) and will be included in the PhD project once analysis of the systematic review is complete.

Furthermore the assessment of VR and ToL lacks rigor (lacking matched control condition)

* There is existing literature on AR and VR technologies that assess learning when additional didactic material (such as instructional pop ups) have been added (Pletz et al. 2020).

Technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) refers to the specific features of a technology that can be used to support pedagogical methods (Mishra & Koehler, 2006).

Affordances of virtual reality technologies to make motor learning better than reality (Levac & Sveistrup, 2014)

It is widely accepted that haptic feedback, spatialized audio, and added pedagogical overlays improve learning in virtual reality (…, …) . However much in the same way that one could learn stoichiometry via a textbook, an experiment, or a podcast listened to while riding the tube; the setting itself has been demonstrated to affect the “learning” itself. I do not aim to answer why virtual reality may be better at teaching something such as chemistry, but the extent to which a task learnt in virtual reality compared to the same task being taught not in VR.


#### Lack of follow up/longitudinal
As per the systematic review 

* Gray and Mierlman are the core ones that actually follows up (cite the two systematic reviews)

 
#### Lack of knowledge about the ecological validity of remote VR
- ie. Does the home environment impact transfer of learning?

> Put the sentences on museums here 

To support ToL: (Boussad et al., 2008) (1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classified according to what is learned; (2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning; (3) specific features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning; (4) transfer can be used to assess a VE’s effectiveness; and (5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning.

```
At the end of background to the study (i.e. what is known so far in the area), need to make clear:
 - Rationale for the project 
 - Overall project aims/objectives

Try and concisely provide 1 more general research question for each study you are running.
```

Despite the acceptance of VR for professional training, the assumption that learning transfers is not well understood by the literature and it remains unclear on if skills taught/learnt in VR are transferable to the real world (Sigrist et al., 2013). 



# Specific Aims and Objectives
As with the above section, 
* Questions and hypotheses about learning 
* Questions and hypothesis about transfer 

For clarity, the aims and hypotheses sections have been merged. Please refer to Appendix for separated lists and a matrix of question x hypotheses x study x analyses. 


### **Question 1: How we acquire skills in Virtual Reality**
_How we learn is not a causal question_
> intro sentences about how this question addresses the gaps in the literature 
> sets up the thesis
> and how it answers the main question 
> why is this question important 

#### Hypothesis 1: subjects will improve at the task after training 

#### Hypothesis 2: skill acquisition is comparable between VR and Natural 
* We get better the same amount 
* H0: training medium will have no effect on performance in the same medium 
* H1: training medium will have an effect on performance in the same medium

#### Hypothesis 3: you will learn faster in VR 
* H0: training medium will have no effect on learning rate 
* H1: training in VR will have an effect on learning rate

### Question 2: Can skills learnt in VR transfer

> intro sentences about how this question builds off the literature 

> why is this question important 
* Ability to transfer from low fidelity to higher 
* Weak fusion 

> and how it answers the main question



#### Hypothesis 4: skills learnt in VR will transfer to the real world 



* H0: training in VR will have no effect on test performance in the Natural condition
* H1: training medium will have an effect on test performance in the Natural condition

**Hypothesis 5:** the transfer between VR and Natural will be greater than the transfer from Natural to VR

* H0: training medium will not affect task improvement
* H1: training medium will have an effect on task improvement 


### Question 3: how will environmental context affect skill acquisition in VR

> why is this question important 
> give background about how context matters 

It is thought that learnt skills may be closely linked to the context that they were acquired in (Desmurget et al. 1997; Michel et al. 2007; Krakauer et al. 2000; Taylor and Ivry 2013) so there is an open question as to if changing the context has an effect on tasks learnt in VR. 

> if you’re in HMD-VR you’re immersed so it may still illicit a reaction (slater walking with a tail) 
 
- psychological sense of ‘being there’ (Slater, 2009) 
- is VR close enough to the real world for experimental context not to matter - does that context affect a participant's ability to learn a skill in VR?

#### Hypothesis 6: subjects will improve at the task after training in remote-VR 

* H0: remote training will have no effect on task performance 
* H1: remote training will positively affect task performance

#### Hypothesis 7: there will be no difference in skill acquisition between in-lab-VR and remote-VR 

* H0: there will be a difference in task improvement between in-lab-VR and remote-VR 
* H1: there will be no difference between training in-lab-VR and remote-VR on task improvement 


### Question 4: Does the training context impact Transfer of Learning?

> why is this question important 
> give background about how context matters 

#### Hypothesis 8: subjects that are tested in the medium they were trained in will perform better than subjects who are tested in a medium different to the one they trained in 

(Remote-VR who test remotely will perform better than remote-VR who test in-lab)

* Remote VR will have an impact on the ability to transfer to natural compared with the transfer from in-lab remote 
    * I.e. the setting/context of VR will have an effect on transfer 
    * there will be a difference between training remotely and training in the lab
    * Such that the remote-VR group will have a harder time transferring to the Natural task 
        * This is because there are 2 context changes that must be overcome in order to transfer the skill 
        * Medium (ie. VR to Natural) and context (ie. remote to in-lab) 
* H0: remote testing will have no effect on the ability to transfer 
* H1: remote testing will have an effect on the ability to transfer 


### Question 5: what effect does training medium have on how long training effects last 

#### Hypothesis 9: subjects that are tested in the medium they were trained in will perform better than subjects who are tested in a medium different to the one they trained in at a 4 week follow up 

* H0: training medium will have no effect on task performance on matched medium at a 4 week follow up
* H1: training medium will have an effect on task performance on matched medium at a 4 week follow up

#### Hypothesis 10: VR trained will be better

* H0: There will be no difference between training medium and task performance
* H1: Participants trained in VR will perform better than participants who received training in Natural at a 4 week follow up 


### Question 6: effect of training medium on skill acquisition / is VR as effective as Natural as a training tool


### Question 7: is there a ‘novelty effect’ from VR conditions that impacts skill acquisition
> background 
> how does this answer the research question 

VR-novel subjects will perform worse than VR-XP subjects at a 4 week follow up
* Due to novelty and extinction 

VR-novel subjects in VR conditions will perform worse at t0 and then ‘catch up’ to their peers 
* Faster initial learning rate 


### Question 8: will the ‘novelty effect’ impact ability to transfer 
* VR-novel who receive Natural training will display the least transfer between mediums 

Based on this, 4 studies and a pilot are proposed to investigate [TODO: transfer of learning from VR to the real world.] 



# Methods

## Subjects

>inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Pre-Screening questionnaire to capture demographic information (age, sex, education level), previous experience with VR, gaming habits, and and previous exposure to motor learning paradigms (this is important as subjects may belong to the University of Leeds medical or dental schools and thus have recieved training on a VR simulator as part of their course).

Inclusion criteria

* Aged 18-30
* Normal vision 
* Normative cognition 
* Normative motor 

Further exclusion criteria will be determined by 
* Use of motor learning training (such as those used by the dental and surgical programs) 
* near/far sightedness/non-normative vision (even if corrected through the use of lenses) 

### Recruitment strategy
Participant recruitment will have four phases based on the paradigm participants are needed for; (1) pilot testing, (2) lab setting, (3) follow up experiment, (4) remote setting.

1. Pilot testing subjects will be recruited from ICON and Center for Immersive Technologies at the University of Leeds as well as available person networks who are unfamiliar with the proposed study aims.
2. Lab or ‘in person’ participants will be recruited from the University of Leeds School of Psychology, School of Engineering, School of Computing, Center for Immersive Technologies, and the Extended Reality Society. Undergraduate Psychology students receive course credit for experimental participation and it is therefore expected for those students to represent the greatest portion of participants.
3. Follow up participants will be recruited from the previous participant pool. Participants will be informed of an available follow up experiment at the conclusion of Study 1 and given the option to register their email address to receive sign up information.
4. Remote or ‘at home’ participants will also use the recruitment channels recruitment channels from (2) with the addition of virtual VR communities (such as The Virtual World Society, Circuit Stream, ARVR Women & Allies, ARVRinEDU, VREducatorsSpatial Network, and Side Quest).
 
### Group Assignment

#### Blinding
The studies will not be traditionally blinded as participants would be aware of the paradigm they were being tested on (i.e. in a HMD or Natural), although participants will not be informed of other groupings across the studies.


#### Matched groups
Groups will be matched as recruitment allows based on the pre-screening questionnaire. - VR experience - Demographics (based on the screening questionnaire)

#### Sample Size
As a novel task is proposed for the project it is difficult to definitively state the sample sizes necessary for investigation.

In order to remediate; analyses (Bayes factor) of pilot data will supplement the guidance from relevant literature in setting appropriate sample sizes.

Literature on transfer of learning from VR laparoscopic surgical trainers supports a 

Current group size is based on the effect size of ***** (citation, citation, citation). This may require adjustment after pilot data is collected (see Gantt chart for information). (Crochet et al., 2011) The choice of at least 10 subjects per group was based on a 2-tailed test, with α = 0.05 and power (1 – β) = 0.80, and an intended reduction of 30% in time taken to complete tasks for intervention versus control groups, based on data from previous studies of VR simulations for skill learning

## Materials
> this is important because the smallest thing going wrong might confound results [Craig, Bastian, & Montagne, 2011](https://scite.ai/reports/how-information-guides-movement-intercepting-MMZbY9)


### Hardware
An Oculus Quest and accompanying touch controllers will be used for VR sessions.

#### Haptics
> Resources https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JMBR.40.6.545-557 Haptic feedback (in VR) has been demonstrated to improve performance Surgery (Kim et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2015; Panait et al., 2009) & Movement (Weller & Zachmann, 2012)

Haptics are important (citation, citation) Questionnaires during pilot testing will collect qualitative data on perceived differences in haptic feedback quality Citation, citation, citation indicates that the proposed use of built-in haptics from the existing VR controllers is good enough low latency haptic feedback which was triggered by the ball hitting a VR maze wall to simulate the force feedback participants received in Natural Force testing is not feasible in the given timeframe (nor is the required hardware available to the student) and is an avenue for further research


#### Mazes
Laser-cut mazes out of MDF measuring 350mm x 350mm x 70mm (external measurements) Box dimensions were informed by anthropomorphic design in order to reduce the risk of ergonomically caused fatigue during trials. - to reduce ergonomic load and therefore fatigue - based on anthropomorphic average - https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_11/sr11_252.pdf - https://multisite.eos.ncsu.edu/www-ergocenter-ncsu-edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2016/06/Anthropometric-Detailed-Data-Tables.pdf See Appendix for mock-up

In VR conditions controllers will be affixed to the box 1/3 up from bottom edge.

Drop holes 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2aaFFbC.png)



#### Maze Design 
The maze will be designed such that no single ‘hack’ or strategy may be used. - this will ensure that the task measures the motor skill that is being acquires as opposed to being confounded by or reflecting a strategy learning or use of a ‘hack’ (such as building up velocity thus lowering chance of falling in a drop hole).

Beta testers will be used pre-pilot testing to ensure appropriate difficulty. This was determined such that a beta tester with no previous maze experience should not be able to solve the maze in under 5 minutes, and no more than 5 solves in a 12 minute time period.

At home Laser cut separator with slots compatible with either the right or left controller to ensure correct controller placement - same width and weight (± 10%) as box


### Software
For rendering the environment in VR, Unity 2019.4 will be used as it, at time of writing, the most stable release for VR development and receives long-term support (LTS) from Unity.


#### Physics simulator
Current VR research on sensorimotor adaptation uses the inbuilt physics engines of Unity or Unreal Engine (the two main commercial platforms used for VR development). It is unknown how closely the inbuilt parameters (e.g. friction coefficients) match reality, however in absence of any concerns raised by previous research, I will also use Unity’s OTS system.

If pilot data (qualitative survey responses and physics simulation benchmarking) indicates that the OTS physics engines are not sufficient, a custom physics engine was built for similar ‘marble maze’ experimentation by the author in 2017 and checked against similar materials (plywood, metal, glass, and acrylic). This engine can be updated to the current software standards and used as a better alternative to Unity’s physics simulator. It is out of project scope to create a novel physics engine for the purposes of the proposed research.


#### Spatialized Audio
Audio feedback important for learning (citation, citation, citation) Spatialized audio is super super important in VR (citation, citation, citation) Spatialized audio cues will be given for the ball hitting the wall, ambient room 

* Delivered via the built in speakers
* Designed and coded using Dolby (citation, citation, citation)

 
#### DeepLab Cut 
As the real world does not have the same omniscient world design, a Razer Kiyo camera will be used to capture movement data in Natural. The data will then be processed by DeepLabCut (Mathis et al 2018: 10.1038/s41593-018-0209-y) on a computer meeting the listed requirements for DeepLabCut. - HPC at Leeds - my machine will do it with a RAM update - Turing Clusters

It is noted that time will need to be allocated for learning how to use DeepLabCut. Various youtube tutorials and extensive documentation is provided by the Mathis lab and that has been addressed in the Gantt chart.

# Research Design

**_Pilot Study_**

A pilot study will be conducted to in order to establish learning rates at the task and inform experimental design, sample size, and statistical analyses (ie. adjustment for a non-parametric distribution).

**The core questions for the pilot study are:**

#### how the task is learnt. 

Different sensorimotor tasks exhibit different learning rates and plateaus (citation, citation). The length of training required for the task will better inform our study design as well as give insight into plateaus (which are of particular concern for the training of surgical skills).

#### effect size

Pilot data will be analysed to assess the observed effect size (if present) which will better inform the sample size needed for recruitment during the full experiments.


### Study 1

**- specific questions addressed**
Study 1 will address the effect of training medium on skill acquisition and subsequent ToL by comparing changes in participants’ performance across time as they test and/or train in either VR or Natural.

It will form the ‘backbone’ of the thesis and the data collected in study 1 will be used in all subsequent analyses. 


**- justification for task used**

Study 1 will provide insight into the effect training medium has on skill acquisition and if the skill taught in VR affects task performance in the real world by … 

**- methods**

##### Study design 

Participants will stand holding the maze at a self-guided height/comfortable height while guiding a ball bearing around a trap maze by tilting a box. In the Natural setting, the maze will be held at opposing vertical sides of the box via Oculus touch controllers affixed to the box.

No more than 24 minutes which is the recommended time Fatigue caused by ergonomic load (citation), and simulator sickness (citation)

The first session all participants in the VR groups will complete Oculus’ “First Encounter” in order to familiarize subjects with a VRE and the controls.

80-120 participants will be recruited 
sorted into 4 groups 

**- data outputs** 
 
##### Participant Data
Questionnaires Pre-experiment: 

- Mental status

Questionnaires Post-experiment: 
- adapted SSQ
- perceived improvement rating 
- noticed anything weird 
- qualitative experience 
- presence 
- interview

##### Task Performance Data
Number of attempts Successful completions Time to successful completion Number, time, and location of error (errors defined by the ball falling in a hole). Controller movement tracking (x, y, z) Ball movement tracking Path taken Velocity Acceleration

The ball movement tracking will support investigation into the path taken, velocity and acceleration, and ‘rests’ (ie. a participant uses a mazewall to rest the ball against before moving) which will provide data on rests taken, total rest time, and location of rests.

In VR these measures will be collected via software variables (Unity).



### Study 2
**- specific questions addressed**


**- methods**
In Study 2, participants will train in VR remotely and be assessed in the lab in either the VR or Natural condition.

 
**- justification for task used**

The results from Study 2 will give insight into how training a skill in VR outside-the-lab affects the transfer of that skill to the real world, as well as insight into the impact context has on skill learning and transfer. Both these insights have implications for VR’s use in rehabilitation (citation, citation), and the future of training as ‘remote’ training - if supported - would allow for distributed training and remote 


**- data outputs** 



### Study 3

**- specific questions addressed**
VR has been adopted by the psychology field for its ability to simulate a ‘real world’ environment such as pedestrian crossings and forest fires (****). Published VR experiments on sensorimotor skill learning have been conducted in museums, shopping malls, and using stalls set up in the thoroughfare of a festival (****), however it has not been investigated (to our knowledge) if data gained outside the lab is different to the results seen ‘in-lab’. Study 3 builds from Study 2 and compares in-lab and remote VR conditions.

Study 4 aims to address 

It is currently unknown how VR training will affect the retention of acquired skills.

**- justification for task used**


**- methods**


1. To assess the impact training medium has on skill retention.
    * subjects from Study 1 will be asked to complete a single follow up 4 weeks after their final session and will be sorted into two groups based on task medium (VR or Natural.) Depending on recruitment each group with have matched representation of their Study 1 groups (i.e. 50% of respondents that received training in a VR group in Study 1 in VR will complete Study 4 in VR and 50% in Natural).
2. To assess the impact training medium has on skill resilience
    * They will complete 2 blocks, the first on something they recognize and the second on one they don’t.
    * Same training maze
    * Different testing maze

# Analysis Ideas

:warning: todo: consolidate the analyses reported in the previous section with this one :warning:


* A Welch t-test will be used to assess the variance between groups. 
* Bayes factor (evidence favors the alt vs evidence favors the null) 
* Graphical analysis of a learning curve (Ramsay, et al., 2001) - regression analyses to fit a curve. Additional ‘analysis of best fit’ may be prudent, accordingly stepwise and exponentials models may also be used during analysis.

### Pilot Study

#### Proposed Analyses 
To assess how long it takes to learn, regression analyses will be used across sessions with graphical analyses reporting the spread and median of each group. 

Further graphical analyses using exponential functions will assess learning plateaus as well as a "model of fit" analyses where stepwise functions will be assessed (*** cite the paper that found that vr surgery best fit a stepwise learning curve). 

Power analyses 
- cohens-d to get effect size (since the alternative hypothesis is that there is learning) (?) 


#### Study 2 Analyses
![](https://i.imgur.com/NzaJQzp.png)

**_Aims:_**


1. establish baseline learning rate

Analyses: Regression analyses to fit a curve - Graphical analysis of a learning curve (Ramsay, et al., 2001)

Hypothesis 1.1: that VR is comparable to Natural to learn the task
> I.e. the training medium will have an effect on your ability to learn the task - There is no strong evidence for differences in learning in the literature (ie. Should be able to learn the same)


> welch t-test only best when there is variance in the means Levene’s test will assume that the variance is equal (but is often under powered so will fail to reject the null that variances are equal)

Hypothesis 1.2: that learning in VR will transfer to the real world

H0: training medium will have no effect on test performance in a different medium

H1: training medium will have an effect on test performance in a different medium

ie. The medium you train in will transfer to different mediums

H0: training in VR will have no effect on test performance in the Natural condition 

H1: training in VR will have an effect on test performance in the Natural condition

Analyses Proposed: - Bayes factor (testing the null of no effect)

Hypothesis 1.3: that you will learn faster in VR

H0: training medium will have no effect on learning rate

H1: training medium will have an effect on learning rate

Proposed analyses - Curve fitting - Groupwise comparison of deltas between sessions

Analyses Proposed:

Hypothesis 1.4: that the transfer between VR and Natural will be greater than the transfer from Natural to VR

H0: training medium will not effect task improvement H1: training medium will have an effect on task improvement

Analyses Proposed:

A Welch t-test will be used to assess the variance between groups.


# Predicted Outcomes 
> synthetic data 
> some generated plots 


# **Limitations**
> to address the overall limitations of this project
- Limitations based on study design


# Barriers to Data Collection
> to outline the barriers to data collection and to indicate that you have thought out the feasibility of the proposed plan to outline how I plan to execute on this plan

It is important to address the risks and barriers associated with a project that proposes the collection of new data. The following section details the barriers this project may face as well as the plans to mitigate identified risks. > Equipment (e.g. hardware and software), COVID-19 planning (risk assessment and contingency plans), Resource Allocation (time, compensation, ) Data Collection Barriers,


### Equipment
There are several concerns when using hardware and software - Project feasibility and risk mitigation has been informed by a duFMEA (Stamatis, 2003) (appendix ***) - such as failure in tracking (Deutsch et al., 2011) - Deutsch, J. E., Brettler, A., Smith, C., Welsh, J., John, R., Guarrera-Bowlby, P., et al. (2011). Nintendo Wii sports and Wii fi t game analysis, validation, and application to stroke rehabilitation. Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, 18 (6), 701–719.



### Experimental Design
> novel experiment (construct validity) Note: it will be critical to control variables ie. errors should not be coming from person, should be coming from the medium

This is not a mechanistic study in that it does not give insight into why. 



* I could just change it to a sandbox, but does the center out sandbox tell you why? 

In addition to the above methodological design, it is important to address attrition rates when proposing multi-session human experimentation.

To mitigate the risk of participants forgetting session sign up email reminders will be sent the day before, morning of, and an hour prior.

In accordance with GDPR, permission will be requested for email contact of the participants. These email records will be stored for either 3 years, or until the completion of this student’s PhD (whichever happens first).

If the participant does not wish for their email to be used, a confirmation of session time with be given verbally and in writing to the participant at the conclusion of each session - e.g. “Your next session is Tuesday, the 31st of August at 8am.”

As discussed in Section *** the estimated participant recruiment minimum to see an effect is ** (maybe 15). - Budgeting for attrition rates during recruitment (ie. recruiting more participants than needed to meet the minimum sample size to find an effect)

    
### Task Choice / Engagement
* A maze provides engagement, difficult but solvable with a defined goal (good for ‘flow’ (citation, citation)

Historically based motor learning tasks (such as cursor representation during a center-out-reach) have been used to examine motor learning strategies in VR (citation, citation, citation) and it is apparent from systematic literature reviews that there is a need for methodical rigor in this field (smith, motor, levac, m-thingy, mine, citation). Traditional reach experiments used by citation, citation, citation would not win in a war of attrition. 
- Bryanton et al, 2006 gamified VR for motor rehab at home 
- children with CP

Resources (building space, headsets from where, hardware from where) 

Compensation for Participation 
- RPP 
- Monetary compensation based on time spent at standard rate 
- time

Analyses over the compared “best path” would need to be gained using methods such as Control Theory
* currently outside of scope  


### Resource Allocation
The time and resources required to complete the proposed experiments is the greatest feasibility concern > Use this section to reiterate the need for insight into feasibility of remote data collection for VR research (which will reduce hours spent in lab testing) > time estimation


# Discussion
[Dalgarno & Lee, 2009](https://scite.ai/reports/what-are-the-learning-affordances-4wWDGa)

Previous studies have assessed the TPK that VR offers VR may be better suited to learning because it does

A larger discussion of these will be explored in the dissertation 

What is needed to learn a skill

Is it logical to assume that we would acquire skills using the same mechanisms, or is it inane to assume such owing to the fact that virtual reality is not, in fact, reality 


### Implications


* using marble maze (this task) for ML robotic motor learning
* fills in gaps
* supports so much future work in VR
* knowing what the differences are between VR in lab and remote

#### remote research


* can we substitute lab for remote
    * can we collect data remotely
* back inference
    * if VR remote is different using VR in lab to study real world behaviours is moot (ie. cannot support the ‘ecological validity’ claim that VR has)
* impact context/environment has on ToL
    * important for rehabilitation

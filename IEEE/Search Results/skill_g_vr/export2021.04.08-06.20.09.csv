But to implement one at an organization, enterprises need more than just technical know-how: the leadership team has to be skilled in management as well. Especially, SOA implies different emphasis of project management. This paper describes in brief the use of system dynamics models for managing large scale SOA projects. System dynamics is a methodology for studying and managing complex feedback systems, such as one finds in business and other social systems. In fact it has been used to address practically every sort of feedback system including project management. In this paper, we will present a framework of managing SOA projects and show how system dynamics model can be used to enhance the effectiveness and agility of SOA project management. A general SOA project lifecycle is presented and two examples are used to illustrate the needs and effectiveness of adopting quantified simulation method such as system dynamics into large-scale SOA projects.","2163-2871","0-7695-2861-9","10.1109/SOCA.2007.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273438","","Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Project management;Service oriented architecture;Monitoring;Large-scale systems;Feedback;Companies;Failure analysis;Software measurement;Information analysis","business data processing;feedback;project management;Web services","system dynamics modeling;SOA;project management;complex feedback systems;project lifecycle","","12","","13","","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this developmental context, we investigate here the use of the recently proposed PICMAES2 episodic reinforcement learning algorithm, which is able to learn high-dimensional motor tasks through adaptive control of exploration. By studying PICMAES2 in a reaching task on a simulated arm, we observe two developmental properties. First, we show how PICMAES2 autonomously and continuously tunes the global exploration/exploitation tradeoff, allowing it to re-adapt to changing tasks. Second, we show how PICMAES2 spontaneously self-organizes a maturational structure whilst exploring the degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of the motor space. In particular, it automatically demonstrates the so-called proximo-distal maturation observed in humans: after first freezing distal DOFs while exploring predominantly the most proximal DOF, it progressively frees exploration in DOFs along the proximo-distal body axis. These emergent properties suggest the use of PICMAES2 as a general tool for studying reinforcement learning of skills in life-long developmental learning contexts.","2161-9476","978-1-4673-4965-9","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400586","","Joints;Covariance matrix;Robots;Trajectory;Vectors;Acceleration;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);robots","emergent proximo distal maturation;adaptive exploration;robot learning;structured exploration mechanisms;reinforcement learning algorithm;degrees-of-freedom;DOF;motor space","","5","","22","","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a growing interest in the testing and training of the multitasking ability, with in house software or commercial psychological products, usually implemented in a static task battery format. In this paper, we propose a 3D game, Multitask In Neurofeedback Driving (MIND) for training and testing of the multitasking ability. The game is developed using the Unreal 3 game engine and incorporates neurofeedback, a technique used in the training of human cognitive abilities, to further enhance the potential benefits of the training procedure. The tasks used in the multitasking condition are inspired by various psychological tests and implemented in a manner that attempts to simulate the general cognitive processes required for multitasking while driving a vehicle or piloting an aircraft. The game comes in three variants, single task condition, multitasking condition and multitasking with neurofeedback condition, for the purpose of validating the training outcomes in future studies.","","978-1-4673-9403-1","10.1109/CW.2015.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7398410","EEG;Neurofeedback training;Neurofeedback game;multitasking;game design","Games;Multitasking;Neurofeedback;Training;Electroencephalography;Roads;Testing","aerospace computing;air traffic control;cognition;computer based training;computer games;electroencephalography;psychology","EEG neurofeedback multitasking game;aviation industry;hiring process;air traffic controller;multitasking ability testing;multitasking ability training;psychological products;static task battery format;3D game;multitask in neurofeedback driving;MIND;Unreal 3 game engine;human cognitive abilities;training procedure;psychological tests;aircraft;single task condition;multitasking condition;neurofeedback condition","","5","","18","","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major problem is the quantification of both training and performance. The case of a swimmer is studied in detail. It is shown that if a time series of training impulses is used as input, his performance in 100 m criterion performances can be modeled rather well with a simple linear system. The major conclusion is that performance appears to be related to the difference between fitness and fatigue functions. The fitness function is related to training by a first-order system with time constant 50 days, whereas the fatigue function is related to training by a similar system with time constant 15 days. An appendix is provided to show how these systems can be simulated on a simple electronic calculator.

Formal education in childhood and youth now becomes a synergy of initial and continuous education, as formal and informal competence education, in terms of various opportunities of society which is based on lifelong learning. In this context, the European Union also proclaimed lifelong learning based on Europe of knowledge as the key development guideline in the first decade of the 21st century. The goal of this paper is to present and analyse the phenomenon of lifelong education of maritime officials in `Split Ship Management', Split, to be precise, in its Nautical training centre, known as `Training Centre'. The mariner education project arose from cooperation with world education centres which use the most recent aspects of maritime theory and practice, both in the domestic and wider world expertise context adjusted to the latest European Union criteria. It is worth emphasising the growing popularity of additional maritime trainings in the world as a necessity of the development of new knowledges and skills in various areas in maritime economy, which are becoming a basis for further development both with individuals and companies. Trainings are conducted in computerised laboratories and on a simulator. This formal framework used for shaping and performing trainings at the Nautical training centre is based on the current knowledge and experience of trainers and their constant strive for modernisation and professional knowledge quality improvement, as well as for knowledge in general as a basic principle of development.","","978-953-233-059-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967270","education of seafarers;concept of lifelong learning;e-learning;inspection and staff management","Training;Marine vehicles;Europe;Navigation;Engines;Educational institutions","computer based training;continuing professional development;marine engineering","nautical training centre organisation;nautical training centre functioning;lifelong seafarers education;European Union;maritime officials;split ship management;mariner education project;modernisation knowledge quality improvement;professional knowledge quality improvement","","","","3","","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we evaluated via simulation the impact of a passive attacker, a denial of service (DoS) attack, and a data swallowing attack. We compared two different adaptive network responses to these attacks against a baseline of no response for 10 and 20 node networks. Each response reflects a level of trust assigned to the captured node. Our simulation used a responsive variant of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm and focused on the response performance. We assumed that the attacks had been detected and reported. We compared performance tradeoffs of attack, response, and network size by focusing on metrics such as ""goodput"", i.e. percentage of messages that reach the intended destination untainted by the captured node. We showed, for example, that under general conditions a DoS attack response should minimize attacker impact while a response to a data swallowing attack should minimize risk to the system and trust of the compromised node with most of the response benefit. We show that the best network response depends on the mission goals, network configuration, density, network performance, attacker skill, and degree of compromise.","","0-7803-8140-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290104","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Computer crime;Routing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Laboratories;Electronic mail;Adaptive systems;Communications technology","military communication;ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","system adaptation;trust response;tactical ad hoc networks;tactical communications;passive attacker;denial of service attack;data swallowing attack;adaptive network;on-demand distance vector routing algorithm","","","","5","","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Innovative technologies and tools are used to provide solutions to existing gaps in current manufacturing systems. The evaluation of scenarios is used to manage risks, costs, prepare for upcoming work and forecast demand. Thus, the use of Digital Twin (DT) has proven its value covering the simulation and creation of virtual environments without the physical investment needed. With emergent technologies comes to a great responsibility for institutes to prepare undergraduate students in the development of novel skills, thus, technologies should be adapted and included into the teaching-learning process to aid the adoption from educational to the industrial sector. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of DT has been used to teach industrial concepts such as the automation pyramid, the programming of programmable logic controllers PLC and the exchange of information through industrial networks along with the concepts that constitute digital twins, such as digital master, digital shadow and modelling through system dynamics.

Realization of precise tracking of a chaotic trajectory generated by a “master system” by a controlled, quite different “slave” system also having aptitude for chaotic motion is an interesting challenge. Lyapunov's 2nd or “Direct” Method is generally used in the literature for such purposes. It is well known that finding appropriate Lyapunov function is rather an “art” that needs special mathematical skills so it needs very talented designers. As an alternative of Lyapunov's Direct Method the use of “Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT)” for the synchronization of the motion of different chaotic systems is studied in this paper via numerical simulations. It is shown that the RFPT-based method is very efficient. In the present paper the signal generated by a 1st order Chua-Matsumoto Circuit serves as a reference trajectory to be racked by a 2nd order chaotic system, the Duffing Oscillator. The interesting finding is reported that while the “brute force” solution achieved by very big simple linear feedback coefficients fails after a short period the adaptive controller operating on the basis of very loose, purely kinematically designed feedback coefficient successfully stabilizes the synchronization.","","978-963-8111-78-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999470","","Chaos;Trajectory;Oscillators;Adaptive control;Synchronization;Robots;Robustness","adaptive control;control system synthesis;feedback;limit cycles;Lyapunov methods;nonlinear control systems;oscillators;position control;signal generators;synchronisation;tracking","adaptive control design;chaos synchronization;Lyapunov direct method;nonsinusoidal limit cycle;chaotic trajectory;slave system;master system;chaotic motion;robust fixed point transformation;RFPT based method;signal generated;Chua-Matsumoto circuit;duffing oscillator;linear feedback coefficient;kinematically designed feedback coefficient","","","","37","","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The synthesis and planning of such robots are generally based on the patient's anatomy and the type of surgery to be performed. However, their practical deployment can be challenging. Open-loop approaches are prone to errors due to modeling accuracy or physiological motions of the patient during the procedure, and human-in-the-loop approaches require specific skills from the surgeon. In this article, we propose an automatic tip-steering approach for concentric tube robots based on visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). This allows a closed-loop control scheme to compensate for open-loop errors, and provides to the surgeon the opportunity to focus on the medical procedure, simplifying the management of the deployment.

Such enterprises are characterized by workers in different locations, subject to different policies, using different communication devices, and having varying degrees of skill sets. This diversity poses challenges in finding the most effective human worker (agent) for tasks like fielding a customer request, helping another agent with additional expert knowledge, or more generally help complete a task like a supply chain exception. We focus on the problem of routing communications to the most effective agent using a spectrum of contextual knowledge: availability, media type, activity, expertise, and location. We determine an optimal 'request-to-agent' routing based on several metrics of effectiveness depending on the communication context. The optimal agent is selected to communicate on a specific media who minimizes the expected duration of interaction while maximizes the probability of successful call completion. Based on our model we have conducted simulations involving context aware and non-context aware routing scenarios. The results indicate that the context aware routing outperforms other conventional request-routing techniques.

This ability has been suggested to be the basis for identifying conspecifics from birth, hence representing a fundamental skill for the development of social interaction. Inspired by this, we propose a computational model to detect biological motion in video sequences acquired by the iCub humanoid robot, as a first step to improve its action understanding and interaction capabilities in a developmental perspective. We propose a temporal multi-resolution motion description which automatically copes with different dynamics and builds on top of low-level features that capture biological motion regularities. The starting point of the representation is the optical flow, a low-level measurement which simulates the limited amount of visual information available at birth. The description is evaluated in its capability to discriminate between biological and non-biological movements. We show how a temporal multi-resolution descriptor can effectively deal with dynamic events of variable temporal duration and complexity. Then we provide evidence that our approach guarantees a robust classification of biological versus non-biological video sequences, which generalizes to new scenarios, including new agents and new actions, also in presence of severe occlusions.","2161-9484","978-1-5090-5069-7","10.1109/DEVLRN.2016.7846792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846792","","Biology;Videos;Dynamics;Kernel;Pediatrics;Visualization;Video sequences","feature extraction;humanoid robots;image classification;image motion analysis;image sequences;robot vision;video signal processing","occlusion;video sequence classification;dynamic events;temporal multiresolution descriptor;visual information;optical flow;biological motion regularities;low-level features;temporal multiresolution motion description;interaction capability;action understanding;iCub humanoid robot;biological motion detection;social interaction development;object motion;human neonates;biological motion complexity","","3","","20","","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a multi-robot system the object tracking accuracy of each robot is usually different because of the dynamic environment and the different sensing ability. The focus of cooperative object tracking is how to fuse different robots' observation to obtain more robust and accurate estimation of the object. This paper investigates this problem using an adaptive consensus based distributed particle filter algorithm. In this algorithm, each robot runs a particle filter to achieve local object tracking. Then a consensus algorithm which can establish an agreement between all robots is utilized to generalize a global posterior about the object state. To fully consider the difference between each robot's object tracking accuracy, Renyi entropy is used to adaptively adjust the weight of the consensus algorithm. The concept of Renyi entropy is utilized to measure the distance between a robot's local posterior and the global posterior and then a weight will be assigned to the robot according to the Renyi entropy. This weight will be used continuously in the next consensus step. By the proposed algorithm in this paper the accuracy and the robust of the cooperative can be improved. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation results.","1934-1768","978-988-15639-3-4","10.23919/ChiCC.2017.8028338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8028338","consensus;distributed particle filter;Renyi entropy;cooperative object tracking","Object tracking;Particle filters;Robot sensing systems;Estimation;Mathematical model;Entropy","entropy;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods)","mobile robotics;multirobot system;adaptive consensus;local object tracking;object state;object tracking accuracy;Renyi entropy;sensing ability;cooperative object tracking;distributed particle filter algorithm;global posterior;local posterior","","1","","10","","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designers, however, lack ways to ensure challenges are suitably tailored to the abilities of each game player, often resulting in player boredom or frustration. Challenge tailoring refers to the general problem of matching designer-intended challenges to player abilities. We present an approach to predict temporal player performance and select appropriate content to solve the challenge tailoring problem. Our temporal collaborative filtering approach-tensor factorization-captures similarities among players and the challenges they face to predict player performance on unseen, future challenges. Tensor factorization accounts for varying player abilities over time and is a generic approach capable of modeling many kinds of players. We use constraint solving to optimize content selection to match player skills to a designer-specified level of performance and present a model-performance curves-for designers to specify desired, temporally changing player behavior. We evaluate our approach in a role-playing game through two empirical studies of humans and one study using simulated agents. Our studies show tensor factorization scales in multiple game-relevant data dimensions, can be used for modestly effective game adaptation, and can predict divergent player learning trends.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2342934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863627","Artificial intelligence;constraint programming;game adaptation;games;machine learning;player modeling;procedural content generation;recommender systems","Games;Adaptation models;Tensile stress;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Recommender systems;Optimization","collaborative filtering;computer games;constraint handling;learning (artificial intelligence);tensors","content selection optimization;role-playing game;multiple game-relevant data dimensions;divergent player learning trend prediction;constraint solving;tensor factorization;temporal collaborative filtering approach;designer-intended challenges;digital games;temporal game challenge tailoring","","","","38","","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the manipulators with imprecise kinematic models (e.g. low-cost arms) or manipulators with unknown world coordinates (e.g. poor camera-arm calibration) cannot locate the gripper with respect to the world. In these circumstances, we can leverage tactile feedback between the gripper and the environment. In this paper, we present learnable Bayes filter models that can localize robotic grippers using tactile feedback. We propose a novel observation model that conditions the tactile feedback on visual maps of the environment along with a motion model to recursively estimate the gripper's location. Our models are trained in simulation with self-supervision and transferred to the real world. Our method is evaluated on a tabletop localization task in which the gripper interacts with objects.

Even though the distribution of skills among the members of a heterogeneous team has a significant influence on its effectiveness, little is known about how to design effective heterogeneous teams. In this paper, we develop a graph-search approach to tackle this team design problem in the context of multiagent routing, a generalizable domain in which heterogeneous, randomly located tasks must be completed in overall minimum time (or make span) given an a priori distribution of their heterogeneity, a fixed team size, and a limited budget. First, we develop complete and optimal search algorithms. Second, we show that dominance-based pruning significantly increases the size of problems that can be solved optimally. Third, we introduce an anytime algorithm called TD-BR that uses beam search with restarts in order to scale up to much larger problems. We evaluate our algorithms empirically in two ways: first, we predict the performance of the teams using a team performance metric called task coverage, and show that our algorithms produce high coverage teams, second, we test a subset of these teams in simulation by allocating the teams to various task sets and measuring their make span. We show that our teams perform well when compared to an ideal homogeneous team, and outperform heterogeneous teams created by other methods. Our main contributions are thus new algorithmic tools for designers of heterogeneous teams in robotics and other domains where modular construction and refitting of robots is possible.","","978-1-4577-1373-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6040802","multiagent coordination and cooperation;teamwork;search","Measurement;Algorithm design and analysis;Robot kinematics;Resource management;Routing;Prediction algorithms","graph theory;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;path planning","heterogeneous teams;multiagent routing domains;heterogeneous tasks;graph-search approach;team design problem;optimal search algorithms;dominance-based pruning;TD-BR;team performance metric;task coverage","","1","","17","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These pre-requisite courses introduced in the lower semesters pave the way for students to develop keen interest, skill and proficiency in the area of Embedded system design. But students of Computer Science generally lack interest in hardware related courses, a fact which has been observed time and again by teachers handling these courses. Therefore the challenges that lay before the course instructors was to make the students take interest in these courses and also to make them industry ready so as to compete with peers from other engineering branches in the domain of Embedded Systems. This paper discusses the experience of the authors in teaching the course on Digital Electronics laboratory. In order to handle the challenges mentioned above, after much debate and discussion, amongst all stake holders, it was decided to apply structured enquiry based learning strategy. Structured enquiry is a form of pedagogical practice that facilitates students' to build on previous learning and provide a strong foundation for further learning in relation to the objectives defined. This approach was also found to enhance the quality of teaching as a result of which students' ability to conduct investigations of technical issues consistent with their level of knowledge and understanding improved. Here we present a set of activities, their related outcome based assessment techniques and outcome based strategies applied to the laboratory course on Digital Electronics in Computer Engineering at the III Semester level. The course was designed to consist of initially, conducting simple exercises to provide hands on experience and use of appropriate modern engineering tools to simulate the designed circuit for the given problem statement after which it was prototyped. Along with the regular lab experiments, student' teams were made to work on course projects which required them to design and build projects. This promoted their self-learning, improved their knowledge of digital circuit design well beyond that directly taught in lectures, improved students' creative thinking, applied logic ability and practical thinking. This paper discusses the attempts made by the course teachers to achieve these goals. The first step was to set appropriate course outcomes (COs). The subsequent step was to align the COs to suitable Program Outcomes (POs) through relevant competencies (CAs) and performance indicators (PIs). Later rubrics were written to assess the attainment of each of the Program Outcomes. This activity resulted in enhanced motivational levels amongst students, increased their involvement in the team and improved their knowledge due to self learning.","","978-1-5090-1062-2","10.1109/MITE.2016.064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049098","Course project;structured enquiry;program outcomes;competencies;course outcomes;performance indicators;assessment rubrics","Computer science;Hardware;Education;Embedded systems;Tools;Digital circuits;Prototypes","computer science education;digital circuits;educational courses;electronic engineering education;embedded systems;further education;laboratories;network synthesis;teaching","rubrics based continuous assessment;digital electronics laboratory course;embedded product design;hardware courses;computer organization;microcontrollers;undergraduate program;Computer Science;embedded system design;teaching;structured enquiry based learning strategy;outcome based assessment techniques;Computer Engineering;self-learning;digital circuit design;course outcomes;program outcomes","","","","8","","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key idea behind MSO is to expose the same adaptation process, Strategy Optimization (SO), to both the training and testing phases. This allows MSO to effectively learn locomotion skills as well as a latent space that is suitable for fast adaptation. We evaluate our method on a real quadruped robot and demonstrate successful adaptation in various scenarios, including sim-to-real transfer, walking with a weakened motor, or climbing up a slope. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the generalization capability of the trained policy in simulated environments.

They have recently gained a lot of attention in operations research, machine learning and policy search of robot motor skills due to their ease of use and their generality. However, with slightly different tasks or objective functions, many stochastic search algorithms require complete re-learning in order to adapt the solution to the new objective function or the new context. As such, we consider the contextual stochastic search paradigm. Here, we want to find good parameter vectors for multiple related tasks, where each task is described by a continuous context vector. Hence, the objective function might change slightly for each parameter vector evaluation. Contextual algorithms have been investigated in the field of policy search. However, contextual policy search algorithms typically suffer from premature convergence and perform unfavourably in comparison with state of the art stochastic search methods. In this paper, we investigate a contextual stochastic search algorithm known as Contextual Relative Entropy Policy Search (CREPS), an informationtheoretic algorithm that can learn for multiple tasks simultaneously. We extend that algorithm with a covariance matrix adaptation technique that alleviates the premature convergence problem. We call the new algorithm Contextual Relative Entropy Policy Search with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CREPS-CMA). We will show that CREPS-CMA outperforms the original CREPS by orders of magnitude. We illustrate the performance of CREPS-CMA on several contextual tasks, including a complex simulated robot kick task.","","978-1-5090-2255-7","10.1109/ICARSC.2016.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7781959","","Context;Covariance matrices;Linear programming;Convergence;Entropy;Robots;Search methods","convergence;covariance matrices;entropy;search problems;stochastic processes","premature convergence;information theoretic algorithm;CREPS;contextual policy search algorithms;parameter vector evaluation;continuous context vector;contextual stochastic search paradigm;objective function;black-box optimizers;stochastic search algorithms;covariance matrix adaptation;contextual relative entropy policy search","","7","","20","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A FAST microwave Emissivity Model (FASTEM), which was developed by the Met Office, U.K., has been widely utilized to compute the surface emitted radiation in forward calculations. However, the FASTEM model was developed for frequencies in the range of 20-60 GHz, and it is biased at higher and lower frequencies. Several critical components such as variable sea surface salinity and full Stokes vector have not been generally taken into account. In this paper, the effects of the permittivity models are investigated, and a new permittivity model is generated by using the measurements for fresh and salt water at frequencies between 1.4 and 410 GHz. A modified sea surface roughness model from Durden and Vesecky is applied to the detailed two-scale surface emissivity calculations. This ocean emissivity model at microwave is now being used in the Community Radiative Transfer Model, and it has resulted in some major improvements in microwave radiance simulations.

Although these two fields evolved separately, they share an interest in human senses, skills, and knowledge production. Thus, bringing them together will enable us to create more natural and realistic virtual worlds and develop better, more effective applications. Ultimately, this will lead to a future in which humans and humans, humans and machines, and machines and machines are interacting naturally in virtual worlds, with use cases and benefits we are only just beginning to imagine.

Art History and Image Science help in understanding the leading and forming functions of today´s image worlds in our society. With the history of illusion and immersion, the history of artificial life or the tradition of telepresence, Image Science offers sub-histories of the present image revolutions. We know that a central problem of current cultural policy stems from serious lack of knowledge about the origins of the audiovisual media and this stands in complete contradistinction to current demands for more media and image competence. Social media competence, which goes beyond mere technical skills, is difficult to acquire if the area of historic media experience is excluded. Although many people view the concept of presence, virtual or mixed realities as a totally new phenomenon, it has its foundations in an unrecognized history of immersive images. Immersion is undoubtedly a key to any understanding of the development of media in general. Overseeing 2000 years of immersive images and by bringing them in a relativity with the image competence of their users, this talk aims to gain distance and with that a reflective thinking space towards the desire to create ever new immersive image experiences.","","978-1-4577-2185-4","10.1109/ISMAR.2011.6092347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162848","","","","","","","","","","5 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Will we ever become used to immersion? Art history and image science","O. Grau",NA,"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality - Arts, Media, and Humanities","1 Dec 2011","2011","","","1","1","Summary form only given. 3D Television and Immersive Cinema, Virtual and Augmented Reality, do we enter soon a total space of polysensual illusion? The aim of this contribution is to create an understanding that the present image revolution using indeed new technologies has also developed a large number of so far unknown visual expressions that cannot be conceived without our image history. Art History and Image Science help in understanding the leading and forming functions of today's image worlds in our society. With the history of illusion and immersion, the history of artificial life or the tradition of telepresence, Image Science offers sub-histories of the present image revolutions. We know that a central problem of current cultural policy stems from serious lack of knowledge about the origins of the audiovisual media and this stands in complete contradistinction to current demands for more media and image competence. Social media competence, which goes beyond mere technical skills, is difficult to acquire if the area of historic media experience is excluded. Although many people view the concept of presence, virtual or mixed realities as a totally new phenomenon, it has its foundations in an unrecognized history of immersive images. Immersion is undoubtedly a key to any understanding of the development of media in general. Overseeing 2000 years of immersive images and by bringing them in a relativity with the image competence of their users, this talk aims to gain distance and with that a reflective thinking space towards the desire to create ever new immersive image experiences.","2381-8360","978-1-4673-0059-9","10.1109/ISMAR-AMH.2011.6093635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093635","","","art;augmented reality;three-dimensional television","art history;image science;3D television;immersive cinema;virtual reality;augmented reality;polysensual illusion;image revolution;artificial life;telepresence;social media competence;immersion","","","","","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Cutting Force-Based Feedback Control Scheme for Surface Finish Improvement in Diamond Turning","S. Jeong; P. I.

The limitation of this control scheme is that the feedback signal does not account for additional dynamics of the tool post and the material removal process. If the tool post is rigid and the material removal process is relatively static, then such a non-collocated position feedback control scheme may suffice. However, as the accuracy requirement gets tighter and the desired surface contours become more complex, the need for a direct tool-tip sensing becomes inevitable. The physical constraints of the machining process prohibit any reasonable implementation of a tool-tip motion measurement. It is proposed that the measured force normal to the face of the workpiece can be filtered through an appropriate admittance transfer function to result in the estimated depth of cut. This can be compared to the desired depth of cut to generate the adjustment control action in addition to position feedback control. In this work, the design methodology on the admittance modelbased control with a conventional controller is presented. Based on the empirical data of the cutting dynamics, simulation results are shown. In addition, the recursive least-squares algorithm with forgetting factor is proposed to identify the parameters and update the admittance model in real time.","","0-7803-0860-3","10.23919/ACC.1993.4793223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4793223","","Feedback control;Surface finishing;Turning;Laser feedback;Admittance;Optical materials;Force measurement;Optical control;Laser beam cutting;Signal processing","","","","1","1","7","","10 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sandia National Laboratories is developing a predictive model and a host of methodologies needed for creating accurate predictions. Operational and maintenance (O&M) data from operating systems is only one piece of a broader data set required to make accurate predictions. Estimating reliability and availability of fielded photovoltaic systems requires times-to-failure or times-to-suspension and downtime data for each of the major components of each system. This paper addresses the collection (data set) and organization (standardized format) of data necessary for reliability and availability analyses. Typically, for a large photovoltaic system the data are censored. The data sets are composed of a mixture of components with failure and components without failure. The data sets must be organized into times to failure, or suspension time in use without failure, for each component that is being analyzed. To accurately estimate availability the various contributors to system downtime, such as corrective or preventative maintenance and grid perturbations, must also be identified and modeled. Preparation of the data for analysis usually consumes a significant percentage of the time required to generate a system reliability or availability estimate. A case study with data from a five year period of a fielded photovoltaic system is used to illustrate how a commercially available software tool for failure reporting and corrective action, XFRACAS™, was adapted to efficiently organize field data and transfer data into a suite of software tools. The software tool Weibull++™ was used to fit life distributions or growth models and to estimate parameters of the distributions. Another software tool, BlockSim 7™ was used for Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) development and simulation of system reliability and availability. XFRACAS™ is a web-based application that provides the capability for point of source data entry into a centralized data base. With some slight modifications, XFRACAS™ is capable of exporting data from the database that is properly organized and formatted for analysis by the life data analysis or reliability growth analysis tools.","0160-8371","978-1-4244-5892-9","10.1109/PVSC.2010.5614373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5614373","","Switches;Inverters;Availability","data analysis;operating systems (computers);photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;power generation reliability;Web services","field data collection;photovoltaic system reliability;data driven capability;material supplier;Sandia National Laboratory;operational and maintenance data;O&M data;operating system;times-to-suspension data;times-to-failure data;downtime data;data analysis;XFRACAS;software tool;Weibull++;BlockSim 7;reliability block diagram development;Web-based application","","1","","2","","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Levine",NA; NA; NA; NA,"2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","16 Dec 2018","2018","","","4691","4699","Humans are remarkably proficient at controlling their limbs and tools from a wide range of viewpoints. In robotics, this ability is referred to as visual servoing: moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual feedback. In this paper, we propose learning viewpoint invariant visual servoing skills in a robot manipulation task. We train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine which actions move the end-effector of a robotic arm to a desired object. This problem is fundamentally ambiguous: under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing approach uses its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to previous visual servoing methods, which assume known dynamics or require a calibration phase. We learn our recurrent controller using simulated data, synthetic demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We then describe how the resulting model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from control and only adapting the visual layers. The adapted model can servo to previously unseen objects from novel viewpoints on a real-world Kuka IIWA robotic arm.

Accuracy of cutting depends on tensioning, wherein the gripper pinches a point on the gauze in R3 and pulls to induce and maintain tension in the material as cutting proceeds. An automated tensioning policy maps the current state of the gauze to output a direction of pulling as an action. The optimal tensioning policy depends on both the choice of pinch point and cutting trajectory. We explore the problem of learning a tensioning policy conditioned on specific cutting trajectories. Every timestep, we allow the gripper to react to the deformation of the gauze and progress of the cutting trajectory with a translation unit vector along an allowable set of directions. As deformation is difficult to analytically model and explicitly observe, we leverage deep reinforcement learning with direct policy search methods to learn tensioning policies using a finite-element simulator and then transfer them to a physical system. We compare the Deep RL tensioning policies with fixed and analytic (opposing the error vector with a fixed pinch point) policies on a set of 17 open and closed curved contours in simulation and 4 patterns in physical experiments with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Our simulation results suggest that learning to tension with Deep RL can significantly improve performance and robustness to noise and external forces.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989275","","Trajectory;Robots;Training;Learning (artificial intelligence);Minimally invasive surgery;Tools;Deformable models","biomedical equipment;finite element analysis;grippers;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;surgery","multilateral surgical pattern cutting;2D orthotropic gauze;deep reinforcement learning policies;fundamentals-of-laparoscopic surgery standard medical training regimen;FLS standard medical training regimen;surgical scissors;tissue gripper;surgical gauze;automated optimal tensioning policy;pinch point;cutting trajectory;tensioning policy conditioned learning;grippers;gauze deformation;translation unit vector;analytical model;explicit model;direct policy search methods;finite-element simulator;physical system;deep RL tensioning policies;open curved contours;closed curved contours;da Vinci Research Kit;dVRK;performance improvement;noise robustness improvement;external force robustness improvement","","17","","33","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AC magnetic field between 0.1 and 100 Hz was applied in order to transfer mutual elements from SC state to resistive one. The AC current of 50 Hz was observed on the load Z and its amplitude was IZ,max = 1.0 A when the source DC current of Io = 32 A was applied. Thus the efficiency became 2.8% in this case. When the frequency was 0.2 Hz, the efficiency became 14%. The main reason of the present low efficiency is owing to the resistance of SC elements. Iz,max increased remarkably when the Io increased beyond the critical current of SC elements. The inverter action has been reproduced by the computer simulation under the non-linear conditions on the VI characteristics. The conditions giving high inverter efficiency was made clear.

In order to use such frameworks to express claims about probabilities of events, one needs mechanisms for resolving the nondeterministic choices. For PIOAs, nondeterministic choices have traditionally been resolved by schedulers that have perfect information about the past execution. However, such schedulers are too powerful for certain settings, such as cryptographic protocol analysis, where information must sometimes be hidden. Here, we propose a new, less powerful nondeterminism-resolution mechanism for PIOAs, consisting of tasks and local schedulers. Tasks are equivalence classes of system actions that are scheduled by oblivious, global task sequences. Local schedulers resolve nondeterminism within system components, based on local information only. The resulting task-PIOA framework yields simple notions of external behavior and implementation, and supports simple compositionality results. We also define a new kind of simulation relation, and show it to be sound for proving implementation. We illustrate the potential of the task-PIOA framework by outlining its use in verifying an oblivious transfer protocol","","1-4244-0053-8","10.1109/WODES.2006.1678432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1678432","","Automata;Distributed algorithms;Processor scheduling;Cryptographic protocols;Algorithm design and analysis;Distributed computing;Radio access networks;Educational institutions;Information analysis;Communication channels","equivalence classes;Markov processes;probabilistic automata","task-structured probabilistic I/O automata;Markov decision processes;nondeterminism resolution;simulation relation","","17","","28","","28 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, evaluating driver engagement by the AD system would lead to safe takeover. Physical engagement is easily estimated but there are few studies on evaluating cognitive engagement. In this study, we thus developed a driver situational awareness estimation system based on glance information. We first defined seven standard glance areas and driver glance classification model using a convolutional neural network. We then obtained a large amount of glance data when both safe and dangerous takeover situations (lane change) by using a driving simulator, and we derived the standard glance model including the glance area and time, in order to estimate whether driver gained enough cognitive re-engagement in real-time. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we created a situational awareness assist system to visually indicate regions with insufficient glance. As a result, we found that the assist system drastically improved driving performance and reduced the number of accidents during takeover.","2642-7214","978-1-7281-0560-4","10.1109/IVS.2019.8814067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8814067","","","cognition;control engineering computing;convolutional neural nets;driver information systems;mobile robots;road vehicles","driver situational awareness estimation system;standard glance model;unscheduled takeover situations;takeover request;human driver;driver engagement;AD system;physical engagement;cognitive engagement;glance information;highly-automated vehicles;control authority;driver glance classification model;convolutional neural network;driving simulator;situational awareness assist system;TOR;automated driving system","","","","17","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A load-balancing (LB) policy for such systems should therefore be robust, in terms of workload re-allocation and effectiveness in task completion, with respect to the random absence and re-emergence of nodes as well as random delays in the transfer of workloads among nodes. In this paper two LB policies for such computing environments are presented: The first policy takes an initial LB action to preemptively counteract the consequences of random failure and recovery of nodes. The second policy compensates for the occurrence of node failure dynamically by transferring loads only at the actual failure instants. A probabilistic model, based on the concept of regenerative processes, is presented to assess the overall performance of the system under these policies. Optimal performance of both policies is evaluated using analytical, experimental and simulation-based results.

In robotics, interactive perception defines a set of algorithms that leverage actions to improve the perception of the environment, and vice versa use perception to guide the next action. Scene interactions are difficult to model, therefore, most of the current systems use predefined heuristics. This limits their ability to efficiently search for the target object in a complex environment. In order to remove heuristics and the need for explicit models of the interactions, in this work we propose a reinforcement learning based active and interactive perception system for scene exploration and object search. We evaluate our work both in simulated and in real-world experiments using a robotic manipulator equipped with an RGB and a depth camera, and compare our system to two baselines. The results indicate that our approach, trained in simulation only, transfers smoothly to reality and can solve the object finding task efficiently and with more than 88% success rate.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197101","","Cameras;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems;Search problems;Clutter;Detectors","cameras;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;object recognition;robot vision;search problems","object finding;cases physical interaction;target object;complex environment;object search;cluttered scenes interactions;reinforcement learning based active perception system;reinforcement learning based interactive perception system;robotic manipulator;RGB;depth camera","","1","","40","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We call the processes as human being's capability for solving problems. In this paper, we try to solve navigation problems by transferring this human being's capability into a mobile robot. Firstly, in the exploration process, the mobile robot collects the environment information and builds the map using the method called 'graph'. Secondly, in the decision process, the mobile robot selects a proper action on the basis of the percepted information and the generated 'graph'. Thirdly, in the behavior process, the selected action is implemented in accordance with the output of the FIS (fuzzy inference system).

To give continuous and completed rollover information, this paper presents a novel rollover index based on a mass-center-position (MCP) metric. The MCP is first determined by estimating the positions of the center of mass of the vehicle, which consists of one sprung mass and two unsprung masses with two switchable roll motion models, before and after tire liftoff. The roll motion information can then be provided through the MCP continuously without saturation for both tripped and untripped rollovers. Moreover, to describe the completed rollover status, different criteria are derived from D'Alembert's principle and the moment balance conditions based on the MCP. In addition to tire liftoff, three new rollover statuses, “rollover threshold,” “rollover,” and vehicle jumping “in the air,” can be all identified by the proposed criteria. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is conducted on some key parameters, such as the sprung/unsprung masses and the height of the center of gravity, to validate the robustness of the proposed detection method. Compared with an existing representative rollover index, lateral load transfer ratio, the fishhook maneuver simulation results in CarSim for an electric vehicle show that the MCP metric can successfully predict vehicle impending rollover status continuously and completely for both untripped and tripped rollovers.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2930698","ASU Ira A.

Due to the beam flexibility of the long vertical links, the precision performance of the end-effector may be severely degraded especially when robots are out-stretching. Normally there is no actuation degree of freedom on the link of deflection to directly compensate for the vibration. Hence, control action is applied to other actuation degrees of freedom based on the kinematic study of the vibration. Specifically, an ILC scheme is employed to off-line modify the reference trajectory of these robot joints for the next iteration based on prior position measurements of the end-effector and the kinematic relationships between the joints and the end-effector.

The proposed current mirror uses MOS current dividers to sample the output current to achieve very high impedance with a large output and voltage range. A feedback action is used to force the input and output currents to be equal. The proposed circuit is also insensitive to the biasing current. This implementation yields an increase in the output impedance by a factor of about gmrout compared with that of the super-Wilson current mirror, thus offering a potential solution to mitigate the effect of the low output impedance of deep submicron CMOS transistors used in low voltage current mirrors and current sources. An NMOS version of the proposed current mirror circuit was implemented using an UMC-180nm CMOS process and simulated using Spectre to validate its performance.

One major drawback of noninvasive BCIs is their low information transfer rate, obstructing a wider deployment outside the lab. BCIs based on codebook visually evoked potentials (cVEP) outperform all other state-of-the-art systems in that regard. Previous work investigated cVEPs for spelling applications. We present the first cVEP-based BCI for use in real-world settings to accomplish everyday tasks such as navigation or action selection. To this end, we developed and evaluated a cVEP-based on-line BCI that controls a virtual agent in a simulated, but realistic, 3-D kitchen scenario. We show that cVEPs can be reliably triggered with stimuli in less restricted presentation schemes, such as on dynamic, changing backgrounds. We introduce a novel, dynamic repetition algorithm that allows for optimizing the balance between accuracy and speed individually for each user. Using these novel mechanisms in a 12-command cVEP-BCI in the 3-D simulation results in ITRs of 50 bits/min on average and 68 bits/min maximum.

This algorithm has some advantages with respect to other control algorithms, such as the fact that the proposed methodology permits all the closed-loop poles of the DVR system to be placed in the desired locations in order to define the dynamical behavior with a reduction in the number of the electrical magnitudes to be measured and without the need for state observers, as occurs in traditional control methods. What is more, the well-known inner current loop implemented in other control schemes, which is employed to attenuate the resonance of the plant, is unnecessary. Furthermore, the unbalanced voltage sag compensation can be achieved by adding a “plug-in” controller and following the same methodology presented for balanced voltage sags to design the controller.

Too much autonomy for data replication increases response times. However lack of processing autonomy also increases response times. A goal is to identify the type of autonomy that facilitates query processing. It is shown that pipelining of the actions for data replication, which include local reduction, data transfer, and union fragments, improves performance whereas pipelining between join and data replication causes deterioration in performance because of competition of resources.

Prior knowledge is effectively incorporated into learning, through action primitives and feature selection increasing sample efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the singulation task.

By the time of switching-on the capacitor, the specific energy introduced into the wire must be equal to the sublimation energy.

We propose a modeling approach to find optimal prosthesis dynamics in gait simulations without constraining the prosthesis to follow kinematics allowed by a specific joint mechanism. To accomplish this, we render a transtibial prosthetic device as the composition of its resultant forces and moments as they act upon the prosthetic foot and socket and allow 3 degree-of-freedom planar motion. The model is implemented into a human musculoskeletal model and used to solve dynamic optimizations of muscle and prosthesis controls to minimize muscle effort and loading on the residual limb during walking. The emphasis on muscle effort vs. limb loading is varied in the minimization objective and the resulting optimal prosthesis dynamics are compared. We found that muscle effort and socket loading measures were reduced for our prosthesis model compared to a revolute joint prosthesis model. We interpret large displacements in the linear axes to transfer energy to the plantarflexion action before toe-off and reduce loading at the socket-limb interface. Our results suggest this approach could assist in the design of non-biomimetic prostheses but requires experimental validation to assess our modeling assumptions, as well as progress toward increased fidelity of predictive simulation approaches more generally.","1945-7901","978-1-7281-2755-2","10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8779532","","Prosthetics;Sockets;Load modeling;Muscles;Loading;Biological system modeling;Legged locomotion","artificial limbs;gait analysis;medical robotics;muscle;physiological models","gait simulations;specific joint mechanism;transtibial prosthetic device;prosthetic foot;degree-of-freedom planar motion;human musculoskeletal model;dynamic optimizations;residual limb;limb loading;revolute joint prosthesis model;socket-limb interface;robotic lower limb prosthesis design;muscle effort;optimal prosthesis dynamics;socket loading measures","Artificial Limbs;Biomechanical Phenomena;Gait;Humans;Joints;Lower Extremity;Prosthesis Design","2","","26","","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Few studies are discussing exact these objects by the importance of object roles, which refer to ones that are relatively concerned and attract more attention of the audience in a short video clip. This paper intends to represent the audience's attention transfer mechanism by attractive objects (key object) and proposes a key object detection network based on temporal reinforcement learning (RL). Temporal RL means our model structure using LSTM to output RL reward values dynamically. In a sense, it avoids formal reward setting may cause the RL result does not achieve expectation. In order to mark the object that attracts the audience's attention in successive switching video clips, our method keeps an eye of the attractive object by iterating the value of temporal RL strategy. The proposed model can detect multiple key objects simultaneously with the help of a temporal RL strategy that analyses the attention transfer. Specifically, the spatial features and temporal features, extracted by the ensemble convolution networks, are sent into the RL model to represent the objects, corresponding motions and less relative backgrounds. Google AVA [24] dataset, annotate the position and action of the main characters among many existing objects, are selected as the experiment dataset. Compared with other models, the results show that the proposed method can continuously focus on the attractive objects in the sequenced fragments. Different from the general structure of the deep reinforcement model based on DQN network, our temporal RL parameters are mainly generated and calculated in the KOD-attention block. Therefore, in the process of simulating the attention transfer mechanism, our method uses lightweight computation to achieve satisfactory detection precision and speed in the performance of key object detection.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181243","key-object;reinforcement learning;attention","Feature extraction;Learning (artificial intelligence);Switches;Object detection;Convolution;Training;Computer science","","","","","","30","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed controller, which is capable of rate-based predictive control, consists of two sub-systems: a long-term policy critic and a short-term rate-adaptor. Each controller in a chained network jointly learns the control policy by real-time interactions without prior knowledge of a network model. Furthermore, a cooperative fuzzy reward evaluator provides cooperative reinforcement signals based on game theory to train controllers to adapt to dynamic network environment. The well-trained controllers can take correct actions adaptively to regulate source flow to simultaneously meet the requirements of high link utilization, low packet loss rate (PLR) and end-to-end delay.

A generic mathematical model for multi-reservoir networks with well-defined MFDs for each reservoir is presented first. Then, an optimal control methodology is employed for the design of perimeter and boundary flow control strategies that aim at distributing the accumulation in each reservoir as homogeneously as possible, and maintaining the rate of vehicles that are allowed to enter each reservoir around a desired point, while the system's throughput is maximized. Perimeter control occurs at the periphery of the network while boundary control occurs at the inter-transfers between neighborhood reservoirs. Based on this control methodology, control actions may be computed in real-time through a linear multivariable integral feedback regulator (LQI). To this end, the heterogeneous network of Downtown San Francisco is partitioned into three homogeneous reservoirs that exhibit well-defined MFDs. These MFDs are then used to design and compare the proposed LQI regulator with a pre-timed signal control plan and a bang-bang controller. Finally, the impact of the control actions to the network is demonstrated via simulation by the use of the corresponding MFDs and other performance measures.","0191-2216","978-1-4673-5717-3","10.1109/CDC.2013.6759896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759896","","Reservoirs;Vehicles;Regulators;Throughput;Vectors;Silicon;Vehicle dynamics","control system synthesis;feedback;multivariable control systems;optimal control;road traffic control","heterogeneous transportation networks;macroscopic fundamental diagram;urban networks;vehicles density;boundary flow control;multireservoir networks;optimal control methodology;perimeter control;linear multivariable integral feedback regulator;homogeneous reservoirs;LQI regulator;bang-bang controller","","","","17","","10 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, a procedure has been proposed to estimate nonparametrically the TV-FRF from known input, noisy output measurements of time-variant systems operating in open loop. However, in many applications, feedback is present either due to an explicit control action or due to the interaction between a nonideal actuator and the system under test. The extension of the open-loop approach to noisy input, noisy output measurements of time-variant systems operating in closed loop requires the deconvolution of the time-variant impulse response of the cascade of two time-variant systems. In this paper, this nontrivial problem is solved for a particular class of time-variant systems.

The unique features includes absence of a base station, as it is in the case of cellular networks, node mobility, multi-hop communication over lossy and non-deterministic wireless mediums, similarity in traffic pattern experienced by neighboring nodes, etc. One of the main reasons for the poor performance of formal TCP version used in wired networks over wireless networks is that the, packet loss in wireless networks is not only due to congestion there are other problem inherent to wireless network which can cause packet loss. To address this issue, this paper proposes a neural network based congestion control technique for reliable data transfer over MANET, which recognizes and capture the mobility behavior of node. The captured mobility behavior is used to identify the cause of packet loss, in order to take action which increases the reliability of underlying MANET.

The fretting tests were conducted with simulated connector configurations using a differential thermal expansion fixture to produce fretting damage. In addition, the waveforms of the contact voltage, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray fluorescence analysis were used to study thc processes involved. The results show that the contact resistance of all combinations of aluminium-contact materials increases very rapidly after a given number of fretting cycles. The effects of fretting are reduced to some extent by applying higher electrical and contact loads. The waveforms of the contact voltage across the couples are severely distorted by the fretting action. The SEM and X-ray fluorescence analyses showed that the contact zones are severely damaged and that substantial transfer of material occurred as a result of the fretting action.","1558-3082","","10.1109/TCHMT.1979.1135431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1135431","","Contact resistance;Aluminum;Conducting materials;Scanning electron microscopy;Voltage;Fluorescence;Wire;Tin;Zinc;Testing","","Aluminum devices;Contacts;Corrosion","","19","","13","","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A collection of randomly/planned deployed tiny Sensor Nodes (SNs) can perform the task according to the need of a specific application. Utilization of energy of SNs is one of the key issues in these networks as nodes are battery operated and recharge or replacement of battery is a difficult task to be achieved. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian Coalition Game-based optimized clustering in WSNs. To formulate the game, we propose a new Hybrid Homogeneous LEACH (HHO-LEACH) protocol for SNs in WSNs. We have used the concepts of Learning Automata (LA), and Bayesian Coalition Game (BCG) in which SNs are assumed as the players in the game with dynamic thresholds-based coalition formation among themselves, i.e., coalition among the nodes are formed using distance-based thresholds which makes a partition of the network field. SNs near to base station use direct communication for data transfer with or without single hop to the Base Station(BS) after interacting with the environment. During this process, each player may get a reward, or a penalty with respect to the finite number of actions performed. Performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using extensive simulations by selecting various evaluation metrics. The results obtained show that proposed coalition game achieved better stability, and network lifetime in comparison to other existing protocols such as LEACH, and DD.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-6432-4","10.1109/ICC.2015.7248873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248873","Lifetime;Homogeneous;LEACH","Games;Tin;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","Bayes methods;game theory;learning automata;pattern clustering;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian coalition game-based optimized clustering;wireless sensor networks;WSN;sensor nodes;energy utilization;battery replacement;battery recharge;hybrid homogeneous LEACH protocol;HHO-LEACH protocol;learning automata;BGC;dynamic thresholds-based coalition formation;distance-based thresholds;network field;base station;direct communication;data transfer;network lifetime","","10","","17","","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach is to first design the controller using established techniques and considering the network transparency, and then analyze the effect of the network on closed-loop system performance. When implemented, an NCS consists of multiple independent sensors and actuators competing for an access to the network, with no universal clock available to synchronize their actions. Since the nodes act asynchronously, we allow access to the network at anytime, but assume each access occurs before a prescribed deadline, known as the maximum allowable transfer interval. Only one node may access the network at a time. This communication constraint imposed by the network is the main focus of the paper.

Experimental results in this study showed that the existing model does not fully describe the characteristic of the lateral dynamics for some typical operating conditions. An experimental model was derived by means of system identification using a well-known least-square method to improve the prediction capability of the lateral dynamics. A commercial guidance system usually has the proportional and integral control structure. Sometimes it may not eliminate the effect of periodic lateral disturbances efficiently which are transferred from upstream spans because the controller relying solely on feedback generates control action only when an output measurement signal differs from a reference value. However, if the disturbance is deterministic, a feedforward control structure may offer simple and effective disturbance rejection performance. In this paper, the lateral position of a web at the upstream span and the identified model of lateral dynamics for the span were used to estimate the effect of disturbance on the lateral dynamics of a moving web at the exit span of the guidance system. A feedforward controller was designed to reject the deterministic disturbance of lateral dynamics of a moving web. The disturbance rejection performance of the proposed controller was verified by computer simulation and experiments. These results showed that the proposed feedforward scheme with an improved mathematical model greatly improved control performance in overcoming the dynamic disturbance.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.836297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360011","Feedforward control;lateral dynmaics;system identification;web;web transport system","Control systems;System identification;Aerodynamics;Mathematical model;Error correction;Pi control;Proportional control;Industry Applications Society;Degradation;Predictive models","feedforward;identification;position control;industrial control;control system synthesis","feedforward control structure;moving Web;system identification;Shelton model;least-square method;proportional control structure;integral control structure;periodic lateral disturbance;upstream span","","21","","9","","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We learn closed-loop policies mapping depth camera inputs to motion commands and compare different approaches to keep the problem tractable, including reward shaping, curriculum learning, and using a policy pre-trained on a task with a reduced action set to warm-start the full problem. For efficient and more flexible data collection, we train in simulation and transfer the policies to a real robot. We show that using curriculum learning, policies learned with a sparse reward formulation can be trained at similar rates as with a shaped reward. These policies result in success rates comparable to the policy initialized on the simplified task. We could successfully transfer these policies to the real robot with only minor modifications of the depth image filtering. We found that using a heuristic to warm-start the training was useful to enforce desired behavior, while the policies trained from scratch using a curriculum learned better to cope with unseen scenarios where objects are removed.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2896467","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; Luxembourg National Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8630008","Grasping;visual servoing;deep reinforcement learning;curriculum learning","Task analysis;Training;Robots;Grippers;Cameras;Data models;Reinforcement learning","closed loop systems;image filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;motion control;robot programming;robot vision","task simplifications;object picking;deep reinforcement learning;manipulation capabilities;robotic manipulator;closed-loop policies;reward shaping;curriculum learning;autonomous robots;reinforcement learning;data collection;depth camera inputs;depth image filtering","","5","","46","","30 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the tactical decision-making for learning-based driving solution, we introduce hierarchical behavior and motion planning (HBMP) to explicitly model the behavior in learning-based solution. Due to the coupled action space of behavior and motion, it is challenging to solve HBMP problem using reinforcement learning (RL) for long-horizon driving tasks. We transform HBMP problem by integrating a classical sampling-based motion planner, of which the optimal cost is regarded as the rewards for high-level behavior learning. As a result, this formulation reduces action space and diversifies the rewards without losing the optimality of HBMP. In addition, we propose a sharable representation for input sensory data across simulation platforms and real-world environment, so that models trained in a fast event-based simulator, SUMO, can be used to initialize and accelerate the RL training in a dynamics based simulator, CARLA. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Besides, the model is successfully transferred to the real-world, validating the generalization capability.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341647","","Training;Transforms;Robot sensing systems;Data models;Planning;Task analysis;Autonomous vehicles","","","","","","34","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the SISO formulation, the reference yaw rate is first defined according to the vehicle handling requirements and is then corrected based on the actual sideslip angle. The sideslip angle contribution guarantees a prompt corrective action in critical situations such as incipient vehicle oversteer during limit cornering in low tire-road friction conditions. A design methodology in the frequency domain is discussed, including stability analysis based on the theory of switched linear systems. The performance of the control structure is assessed via: 1) phase-plane plots obtained with a nonlinear vehicle model; 2) simulations with an experimentally validated model, including multiple feedback control structures; and 3) experimental tests on an electric vehicle demonstrator along step steer maneuvers with purposely induced and controlled vehicle drift.

The bus impedance matrix is utilized to obtain a transfer function from the LoG location to variations of voltage and current phasors following the event. This results in an overdetermined system of linear equations whose closed-form solution provides the LoG location and size based upon the sum of squared residuals concept. The proposed method removes the need for the reception of specific measurements in the control centre, and/or knowing the system inertia. This is in contrast with previous methods resorting to the swing equation of the centre of inertia.

Human being is assumed to solve a problem through four processes: exploration process (EP), decision process (DP), behavior process (BP) and learning process (LP). We call the processes as human being's capability for solving problems. We try to solve navigation problems by transferring this human being's capability into a mobile robot. Firstly, in the exploration process, the mobile robot collects the environment information and builds the map using the method called 'graph'. Secondly, in the decision process, the mobile robot selects a proper action on the basis of the percepted information and the generated 'graph'. Thirdly, in the behavior process, the selected action is implemented in accordance with the output of the FIS (fuzzy inference system). Finally, in the learning process, the parameters of 'graph' are updated via repeated implementing. We show that this method is promising for the mobile navigation problems through a number of simulations.","1098-7576","0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1381007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381007","","Mobile robots;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Motion planning;Mechanical engineering;Electronic mail;Navigation;Solid modeling;Graph theory;Joining processes","mobile robots;learning systems;graph theory;navigation;fuzzy reasoning","map building;autonomous mobile robot localization;graph theory;fuzzy inference system;human navigation;exploration process;decision process;behavior process;learning process","","4","","9","","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the challenges of collecting effective training data and learning efficiently, most grasping algorithms today are limited to top-down movements and open-loop execution. In this work, we propose a new low-cost hardware interface for collecting grasping demonstrations by people in diverse environments. This data makes it possible to train a robust end-to-end 6DoF closed-loop grasping model with reinforcement learning that transfers to real robots. A key aspect of our grasping model is that it uses “action-view” based rendering to simulate future states with respect to different possible actions. By evaluating these states using a learned value function (e.g., Q-function), our method is able to better select corresponding actions that maximize total rewards (i.e., grasping success). Our final grasping system is able to achieve reliable 6DoF closed-loop grasping of novel objects across various scene configurations, as well as in dynamic scenes with moving objects.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2020.3004787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126187","Deep learning in grasping and manipulation;deep learning for visual perception","Grasping;Robots;Grippers;Task analysis;Cameras;Tools;Visualization","control engineering computing;end effectors;grippers;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);rendering (computer graphics);robot programming;robot vision","grasping algorithms;open-loop execution;reliable 6DoF closed-loop grasping;robust end-to-end 6DoF closed-loop grasping;intelligent manipulation;reinforcement learning;end-effector","","1","","40","IEEE","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The synapse is formed by a two-stage charge transfer device with the weight function stored in a floating gate over the first stage. The output of the synapses feeds into the multi-gate inputs of a MOSFET which themselves capacitively couple onto a common floating gate. This MOSFET provides a summing action and so acts as a point neuron. Thermal generation within the synaptic device, causes relaxation of the signals and this can be tailored to provide realistic postsynaptic potential (PSP) dependencies. Simulation results show that this architecture can generate a PSP that effectively mimics the spiking behaviour of real synapses. The cell is highly compact and intrinsically low power and so offers the potential for biologically plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) in hardware.","2161-4407","0-7803-9490-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716285","","Neurons;MOSFET circuits;Silicon;Charge coupled devices;Feeds;Signal generators;Biological system modeling;Cells (biology);Neural networks;Neural network hardware","logic design;low-power electronics;MOSFET;neural chips","low power compact spiking neuron cell design;charge-coupled silicon synapse;floating diffusion output;two-stage charge transfer device;MOSFET;postsynaptic potential dependency","","","2","16","","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to ensure the network Quality of Service(QoS), various methods have been proposed to be able to detect the faulty nodes and take action to avoid further degradation of the service. In proposed methods, the nodes should transfer sensing data with fault diagnosis data. Therefore, the total network traffic is increased. In this paper, we assume that a specific algorithm module based on majority voting for performing a fault diagnosis is applied in IEEE 802.15.4 network. We divide the interested area into several zones, then assign a different time to perform the fault diagnosis for each zone. The time can be set considering the condition of a zone.

The goal of SAR operation is to search the largest area of the territory in the shortest time possible and find a lost or injured person. Today, drones (UAVs or drones) are increasingly involved in search operations, as they can capture a large, controlled area in a short amount of time. However, a detailed examination of a large amount of recorded material remains a problem. Even for an expert, it is not easy to find searched people who are relatively small considering the area where they are, often sheltered by vegetation or merged with the ground and in unusual positions due to falls, injuries, or exhaustion. Therefore, the automatic detection of persons and objects in images/videos taken by drones in these operations is very significant. In this paper, the reliability of existing state-of-the-art detectors such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN on a VisDrone benchmark and custom-made dataset SARD build to simulate rescue scenes was investigated. After training the models on selected datasets, detection results were compared. Because of the high speed and accuracy and the small number of false detections, the YOLOv4 detector was chosen for further examination. YOLOv4 model results related to different network sizes, different detection accuracies, and transfer learning settings were analyzed. The model robustness to weather conditions and motion blur were also investigated. The paper proposes a model that can be used in SAR operations because of the excellent results in detecting people in search and rescue scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063681","Croatian Science Foundation through projects “Automatic recognition of actions and activities in multimedia content from the sports domain” (RAASS); “A Knowledge-based Approach to Crowd Analysis in Video Surveillance” (KACAVIS); University of Rijeka; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369386","Convolutional neural networks;object detector;person detection;search and rescue operations;UAV;YOLO","Drones;Detectors;Search problems;Data models;Injuries;Feature extraction;Vegetation mapping","","","","","","75","CCBY","4 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The studies on the topic tackle various problems, such as the hand dexterity, the communication cues, the arms motions, the forces, the head motions, but most of them consider a handover as an independent action, decorrelated from the plan it is part of. In this paper, we consider situations where it might be necessary (or preferable) to achieve several handovers in order to transfer an object from one agent to another one. This problem complexity grows accordingly with the number of agents that might be involved in the task, making a classical approach under efficient. We propose a graph-based approach enabling a fast computation of a solution taking into account different parameters linked to the humans comfort and preferences. An abstract model of the task is also used as a heuristic to guide the search in the graph, a search which is performed with a Lazy Weighted A*. The method computes which agents (human or robot) to use and where handovers should be performed. It also computes motion plans for each robot, ensures that humans can reach handover places and preserves comfort of human partners by reducing, for instance, their efforts. The method has been implemented and is demonstrated on various simulated multi-agents environments and on our two PR2 robots interacting with two humans.","","978-1-4799-9994-1","10.1109/IROS.2015.7354302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354302","","Handover;Robots;Navigation;Planning;Computational modeling;Search problems","graph theory;human-robot interaction;motion control;multi-robot systems;path planning","handovers planning;constrained environment;hand dexterity;communication cues;arms motions;forces;head motions;object transfer;graph-based approach;humans comfort;humans preferences;lazy weighted A*;motion plans;multiagents environments;PR2 robots;human interaction;human-robot collaboration","","9","","24","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the extreme conditions such as high water pressure, invisibility and non-oxygen become great barriers for human to access directly. Underwater robots are expected and developed as efficient tools for the operation instead of human beings. In order to realize underwater robots, the autonomy and intelligence of robots are one of the most important research topics and AUVs are the new tools for underwater operations. The demand of getting work using AUVs will increase and the missions become more and more complicated. Therefore, manipulators which are mounted on AUVs are expected to play an important role for complex tasks. This paper discusses the dynamics and control of an underwater robot equipped with a manipulator. The motion of multi-body systems in underwater environment has a lot of difficulties because that all bodies are not kept on fixed objects, and the movement of a body effects other bodies and excites each other, etc. The fluid dynamics also makes the problem more complicated matter. The nonlinear forces, such as drag forces and hydraulic forces, act on both the manipulators and the robot vehicle. Recent years, many studies on underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UYMS) have been examined. We have also studied dynamics and control of a manipulator mounted on a robot in horizontal and vertical plane and proposed a method using resolved acceleration control (RAC). In this paper, kinematics and dynamics of a 2-link underwater manipulator mounted on an AUV ""Twin-Burger"" which was developed as a testbed for intelligent software development, and a RAC method for underwater manipulator is described. Next, the routing algorithm using the dynamic manipulability of the robot is proposed considering the coordinate action between manipulator and AUV. In order to evaluate effectiveness of the RAC method and the routing algorithm numerical simulations are performed. The simulation results show the good control performance. Based on the simulation, we designed a Manipulator using a CAD system. Magnet coupling method is introduced to transfer torque into the joints in order to realize waterproof mechanism.

Using a mapping from pixel space to Cartesian space according to the depth map, this method transfers to the real world with high fidelity and introduces a novel attention mechanism that substantially improves grasp success rate in cluttered environments.

These torque pulsations are the main cause of shaft overstressing and result in the premature failure of gearboxes, rotors and drive trains. The control strategy implemented makes use of well-known Proportional (P) and Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers, and therefore does not need sophisticated models of the wind turbine system requiring knowledge of parameters specific to the machine. The controller implemented consists of two control loops, the one being a speed control and the other a torque controller. The controller is implemented on a 2kW three-phase permanent magnet wind turbine. System simulations showed that the control strategy was able to operate successfully, however, in practice it was found that the speed control loop operated but the torque control was unsuccessful. This was due to high levels of noise as a result of the differential action on the torque feedback loop.","","978-1-4673-4569-9","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505773","wind turbine;shaft stress;gearbox failure;torque pulse compensation","Wind turbines;Torque;Shafts;Stress;Generators;Rotors;Transfer functions","fatigue;feedback;gears;PD control;shafts;torque control;velocity control;wind turbines","wind turbine control strategy;shaft stress reduction;fatigue loading;wind turbine drive trains;premature gearbox failures;speed control;torque pulsations;proportional derivative controllers;torque control;torque feedback loop","","2","2","14","","22 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider as an example a human who is driving a car. The behavior of human controllers as drivers has been modeled in the literature as a linear time invariant system cascaded with a time delay. We show that such a human model is not passive. In order to guarantee passivity of a closed loop system with a human controller, we use a passivation method. Through an appropriate design of the passivation parameters, positive passivity indices can be guaranteed for the closed loop system. The passivation parameters can be selected by solving an optimization problem such as minimizing the tracking error.

The approach taken is to consider two kinds of operation: a saturated case characterized by maximum throughput as the most suitable measure of performance, and a nonsaturated situation for which waiting and transfer times are the appropriate measures. The analysis is performed by means of both simulation and analytic techniques. Within the simulation model, the information transfer phase of the HDLC procedure was implemented in full detail. The key idea of the analytic approach is to use a so-called virtual transmission time, a quantity comprising both the real constant transmission time of a message and the duration of recovery actions in case of transmission errors. It allows the performance measures to be represented by explicit and easily-computable expressions. The results provide a fundamental insight into how the most relevant parameters interact and determine performance.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOM.1980.1094606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1094606","","Performance analysis;Communication system control;Protocols;Throughput;Computer aided manufacturing;Analytical models;Computer errors;Data communication;Computer networks","","Computer communications","","60","","18","","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem extends to system modeling practices. This challenge has been confronted with a wide variety of techniques. These techniques include attempting to interface tools together into combined suites, attempting to find underlying commonalities in mathematics, supporting connections through semantic encoding, various graph mappings and transformations, and code wrappers. All of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses. These are measured in multiple areas: relative freedom of action of individual domain engineers in developing their own tools, speed of execution, ease of creation, traceability, fidelity of information transfer, and degree of alignment between the concepts of different domains. This paper presents an approach to this interoperation problem currently being used in the World-Wide Web. The approach is to develop easy-to-parse formats that allow flexibility to both the file author and file interpreter. Many of the formats that are currently deployed sacrifice runtime performance for the ability of third parties to easily understand what to do with the data. XML became popular earlier as a de-facto standard format for many web applications, but is now being replaced by JSON to enhance human readability and provide a simpler data model. This is the basis for work in this paper. Our approach, which provides the key to interoperation, is a simplified “shrapnel” intermediate collection of objects an d relationships that is the result of a breakdown of the system model into minimal pieces. It is then reassembled on the destination side, forming a two-step transformation. Previous efforts with single-step transformations have proven too difficult to create efficiently. In contrast, the use of this approach leads to an almost automatic procedure for transformation development. The Europa project is a large engineering project that must coordinate the efforts of many different teams with different specialties. The traditional form of exchanging engineering information has been documentation. The vision of model-based systems engineering is to make this information exchange much more digital. This paper presents the application of our simplified format to connecting two different engineering tools to the system model, with a focus on a dynamic mission simulation encoded in Modelica.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500656","","Unified modeling language;Object oriented modeling;Software;Wheels;Databases;Data models;Jupiter","graph theory;Internet;XML","multidisciplinary model transformation;simplified intermediate representations;engineering tools;interface tools;semantic encoding;graph mappings;graph transformations;code wrappers;World-Wide Web;de-facto standard format;human readability;transformation development;Europa project;dynamic mission simulation","","1","","8","","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of these improvement methods created extremely weak wire bonding structure, therefore causing further amplification of resonance effect, generating more stress in wires. Eventually, QFN production can not be avoided from having stress effect on wire neck and wire heel, and failing at customer applications. Normally, stringent automotive and hand-phone stress requirements were the two critical applications having failures. In the initial evaluations, QFN stress issues were found difficult to be resolved by executing design of experiment (DOE) and response surface methodology (RSM) on suspicious main factors. By utilizing statistical approach, a new evaluation methodology was developed, assuming severe complication in interaction effects with full resolution for factors more than five. In further analysis of interaction effects, there was ignorable effect of independent factor, and instead all significant factors were best to be presumed as combined interaction. Each suspicious factor need to pass through screening tests respectively either by DOE or comparative method, in order to measure its significant level. Once all significant factors were identified with recommended optimum process window, they were combined back into an interaction configuration. The established interaction configuration was then tested on its robustness in wire bonding responses including stress heel and neck. With the approach of bonding to fail, actual performance margin could be obtained, and hence production margin can be derived or designed properly. Throughout evaluations, several knowledge tools were created, and enabled discovery of some breakthrough findings. From high speed and high resolution camera, combination of machine hardware and leadframe design revealed different level of mechanical bouncing control during wire bonding process. The bonding rigidity has direct impact to resonance effect, with easily bounced structure caused more unnecessary energy transfer or stress in wire. From mapping process, peripheral units are highly affected area, followed by wire bonding dimensions such as loop height and length. Utilization of bonding sequence was found useful in altering resonance effect on sensitive units or wires, hence reducing stress buildup. Furthermore, a lot of finite element analysis (FEA) analysis helped in determines rigid leadframe design against resonance effect and also new wire bonding mechanism to divert stress to proper locations. Despite that, material properties selection and control were found very important in keeping stability in production, especially QFN tape, wire type, and leadframe tolerance. Finally when the combined optimum interaction was put to test, it could withstand up to four times larger ultrasonic power than normal configuration. Despite the package robustness, improvement actions have not sacrificed package features for market competitiveness. With extensive verification with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high power scope, optimum interaction was proven to be robust & stable in production mode.","","978-1-4244-1324-9","10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469717","","Stress;Wire;Bonding;Neck;Packaging;Resonance;Production;Testing;Robustness;US Department of Energy","electronics packaging;failure analysis;finite element analysis;lead bonding;resonance;scanning electron microscopy;shear modulus;stability;statistical analysis;stress analysis","QFN wire bonding process;stress neck;stress heel;quad flat no-lead package;QFN stress issues;statistical approach;interaction effects;optimum process window;interaction configuration;production margin;mechanical bouncing control;bonding rigidity;resonance effect;mapping process;bonding sequence;finite element analysis;rigid leadframe design;production stability;leadframe tolerance;scanning electron microscope;SEM;package robustness","","2","","2","","7 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results of simulation modeling of the QPSK-GLSS shaper, which performs the modulation process directly at the operating frequency in the microwave range, under conditions when the use of a programmable element base becomes ineffective, are presented. To synthesize the QPSK signal, the structure of the GLSS is supplemented with special control units that transform the phase portrait in such a way that the points of stable equilibrium of the system are located in steps equal to π/2 radians. The first control unit implements static shifts of the locations of the system stable equilibrium points equal to ±π/4 along the phase axis of the system phase portrait, depending on the polarity of the control signal. The second unit of binary control implements alternate synchronization of the GLSS system at two points of stable equilibrium located at a distance of π radians from each other. Joint combinations of control actions give a complete set of phase shifts of the system output signal relative to the reference oscillation, which corresponds to the QPSK manipulation: [-π/4; π/4; 3π/4; 5π/4].

Since stationary battery manufacturing is relatively new to China, different levels of battery quality and consistency are being delivered by a variety of battery suppliers, thereby presenting a challenge to Chinese telecom operators. This paper is a study presenting how ohmic testing can be successfully used by telecom operators in China to maintain and test the health of batteries in their networks, thus makes the maintenance work pertinent and proactive, cost effective and highly efficient. It can also be utilized as a quality assurance tool used both at battery manufacturing facilities in China to improve the quality of batteries manufactured and as an effective acceptance procedure by the telecom operators. China Mobile is one of the largest battery users in the world. Since early 2006, China Mobile has performed thousands of ohmic conductance tests and subsequent discharge tests on batteries and battery strings. These tests were performed to ascertain the consistency between conductance test data and battery capacity as determined by off line discharge testing. Initial analysis of the results indicates an acceptable correlation between conductance and discharge capacity test results. And the application of this relationship will change the traditional practice of battery maintenance work, thus providing significant value for the telecommunications operators. The final conclusion of this project will demonstrate how telecom operators can have better control of the quality of new batteries, and effectively evaluate the performance of the batteries of different model types from different manufacturers. Also, on-line conductance testing can screen out the defective or low performing cells, and can effectively advise the maintenance technicians to take pertinent maintenance action. Meanwhile, the application of the relationship between conductance and capacity will enable the users to make the best use of the batteries while obtaining the required back-up time during their service life. It also provides reasonable indication of the need for replacement of a battery, thus maximizing maintenance efficiency. With the accumulation of conductance testing data and the analysis of it, telecom operators can have more accurate projections of the battery's aging tendency and its life cycle, thus taking the appropriate preventive maintenance actions and proactive purchasing strategy. The whole process will greatly decrease the overall work load and cost investment. With more understanding of ohmic testing and more confidence in the technology Chinese telecom operators will do less discharge testing over time.","2158-5210","978-1-4244-1627-1","10.1109/INTLEC.2007.4448766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448766","","Batteries;Testing;Maintenance;Costs;Manufacturing;Telecommunications;Performance evaluation;Valves;North America;Europe","lead acid batteries;maintenance engineering","battery ohmic testing;network reliability;battery maintenance cost;valve regulated lead-acid batteries;telecom operators;battery manufacturing facilities;line discharge testing;online conductance testing;maintenance efficiency","","1","","6","","8 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Video on demand systems have been widely studied and most proposed designs take advantage of the (largely) predictable nature of the I/O stream to provide both guaranteed upper bounds on delay and reasonably high resource utilizations. For disk based 3D interactive systems the problem is very different since the user's actions determine the future deadlines for model data at the display. The data layout we propose and evaluate in this paper abandons the idea of a careful layout of data for a completely randomized layout. We consider large, multidisk systems in which the 3D model data is partitioned into granules which are the logical unit of data that gets transferred an and out of the active scene graph. Granules form parity groups as is familiar from disk arrays. In the proposed system, the use of redundancy in the form of parity is used under normal conditions for load balancing (since for a parity group of size G, any G-1 blocks can be read to obtain the data). Preliminary simulation results suggest that for moderate increase in storage for parity, one can obtain high degree of disk bandwidth utilization combined with a ""nearly guaranteed"" maximum delay, i.e., with probability approaching 1.

Recently, organic-lead halide perovskite semiconductors (CH3NH3PbX3 with X = Cl, Br, I), with high optical absorption coefficient, optimal direct band gap, and long electron/hole diffusion lengths, good optical properties and long electron hole diffusion length, which ensure adequate gain and efficient optical feedback, have become a research hotspot to achieve semiconductor lasers. Up to now, both Fabry-Perot (FP) lasing and Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) lasing have been observed in perovskite micro-cavities, such as microwires, hexagonal microplates and square microdisks. However, the lasing mechanism is fixed once the perovskite microcavity is synthesized. Here the transition between FP lasing and WGM lasing is demonstrated in perovskite microwires and moreover, the transition is reversible without any damage to the samples. The CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microwires are synthesized with one-step solution based self-assembled method and the typical lengths are tens of microns with an aspect ratio about 1 in the transverse plane. When perovskite microwire on glass substrate is pumped uniformly above threshold, FP lasing action can be observed which oscillates between the two end facets along the microwire axial direction. By repositioning the microwire on a perovskite block with one end suspending in the air or placing a perovskite block on one end of the microwire via micromanipulation, the FP lasing mode can be suppressed. In such case, single mode lasing can be excited when the suspending end of the microwire is pumped. After transferring the microwire to glass substrate again, FP lasing can be observed when pumped uniformly. Numerical simulations show that the perovskite block induces huge leaky loss to the microwire, which suppresses the FP lasing mode. As the lasing modes corresponds to the high quality (Q) modes, WGM modes exhibit larger Q factor than the FP modes in the transverse plane. Therefore, the single mode lasing originates from WGM mode in the transverse plane when the FP modes are suppressed. By introducing perovskite blocks, transition between FP lasing in the microwire axial direction and WGM lasing in the transverse plane can be achieved without any damage to the sample. The proposed mechanism provides a simple and flexible way to tailor the perovskite lasing actions, exhibiting potential applications in integrated photonic circuits and light sources.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7734835","","Optical feedback;Optical pumping;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Geometrical optics;Laser feedback","absorption coefficients;integrated optics;laser cavity resonators;laser feedback;laser modes;micro-optics;optical losses;organic semiconductors;Q-factor;refractive index;semiconductor lasers;whispering gallery modes","reversible transition;FP lasing;Fabry-Perot lasing;WGM;whispering gallery mode;perovskite microwires;semiconductor microwires;geometric uniformities;optical gain;refractive index;microscale electronic building blocks;microscale optoelectronic building blocks;semiconductor lasers;organic-lead halide perovskite semiconductors;optical absorption coefficient;direct band gap;electron hole diffusion length;optical properties;optical feedback;microcavities;hexagonal microplates;square microdisks;self-assembled method;lasing mode;glass substrate;leaky loss;high quality modes;Q factor;transverse plane;integrated photonic circuits;light sources","","","","","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the root causes is the transient overvoltage (TOV) associated with circuit breaker reclosing. To solve this problem, researchers propose a series of controlled switching methods, most of which belong to deterministic control. However, in power systems, especially in distribution networks, the switching transient is buffeted by stochasticity. Since it is hard to model transient overvoltage due to its complexity, we propose a model-free stochastic control method for reclosers under the existence of uncertainty and noise. Concretely, to capture high-dimensional dynamics patterns, we formulate the recloser control problem by incorporating the temporal sequence reward mechanism into a deep Q-network (DQN). Meanwhile, we embed our physical understanding of the problem into the action probability allocation and develop an infeasible-action-space-elimination algorithm. Through PSCAD simulation, we first reveal the impact of load types on cables’ TOVs. Then, to reduce the training burden for the proposed reinforcement learning (RL) control method in different applications, we establish a post-learning knowledge transfer method. After the validation with our industrial partner, we exhibit several learning curves to show the enhanced performance. The learning efficiency is proved to be outstanding due to the proposed time sequence reward mechanism and infeasible action elimination method. Moreover, the results on knowledge transfer demonstrate the capability of method generalization. Finally, a comparison with conventional methods is conducted. It illustrates the proposed method is most effective in mitigating the TOV phenomenon among three methods.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2020.3002503","National Science Foundation of the United States; An Investigation of the Effects of Reclosing on Distribution Systems with Under-ground Cables; Sensor Enabled Modeling of Future Distribution Systems with Distributed Energy Resources; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117181","Transient overvoltage;cable failure;controlled switching;reinforcement learning;post-learning knowledge","Power cables;Switches;Voltage control;Transient analysis;Surges","","","","","","32","IEEE","15 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To determine the caching scheme for decentralized caching networks, the content preference learning problem based on mobility prediction is studied. We first formulate preference prediction as a decentralized regularized multi-task learning (DRMTL) problem without considering the mobility of mobile terminals (MTs). The problem is solved by a hybrid Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel proximal multi-block alternating direction method (ADMM) based algorithm, which is proven to conditionally converge to the optimal solution with a rate O(1/k). Then we use the tool of Markov renewal process to predict the moving path and sojourn time for MTs, and integrate the mobility pattern with the DRMTL model by reweighting the training samples and introducing a transfer penalty in the objective. We solve the problem and prove that the developed algorithm has the same convergence property but with different conditions. Through simulation we show the convergence analysis on proposed algorithms. Our real trace driven experiments illustrate that the mobility-aware DRMTL model can provide a more accurate prediction on geography preference than DRMTL model.

This approach consists of three steps. The first step of it is related to the tuning of the Proportional plus Derivative (PD) controller in an internal loop of the controlled process. We considered some typical cases of linear plant models and presented the rules for tuning the parameters of the PD controller in the internal loop. Such internal loop is further on treated as an equivalent plant for which one has to decide whether to use the linear or nonlinear model and its corresponding implementation. As a second step, the choice and implementation of the internal loop model is considered. A zero-steady state error in cases of the piecewise constant changes of the reference and disturbance at output of the plant is achieved thanks to the embedding integral action into the IMC structure. The tuning of parameters of the embedded integral control law is the third step of the whole design approach. In the case of strong and variable process nonlinearity, despite the improving the overall dynamic characteristics of the obtained internal loop closed with the PD controller, in this paper we use the Fast Clustered Radial Basis Function Network (FCRBFN) equipped by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning algorithm to implement internal model of the equivalent plant. Adaptive and robustness characteristics of the proposed control design approach are provided by on line learning of the varying process dynamics model and the used IMC structure.

Through dividing the border of cells into several segments, and marking by identities, when serious inter-cell interference occurs, the serving cell transfer the region information with the coordination information. The neighbor cell can judge whether it has exerted interference on the serving cell and perform ICIC action if it is yes. It can drastically improve the adjustment accuracy of ICIC.

"Effects of customer use on emissions for optimised operation HEV","M. Schudeleit; F.

A method is developed to model the transient emission behaviour of a combustion engine using a semi-empiric approach. The transient emission models for the customer simulation are based on a variant transfer function (first or second order). It can calculate the transient torque as well as emissions (i.e. CO2, NOx, soot). In contrast to by now usual static emission maps, the dynamic model enables a more exact calculation of real emissions of engines. As the real emissions are achieved in customer use, the customer behaviour is considered in the optimisation process of the optimal operation strategy (OS). The multicriteria problem of minimising the emissions of CO2, NOx and soot simultaneously is transformed into a one-criterion problem via a target function. For the practical realisation of the operation strategy in a cycle, such as NEDC or WLTP, and customer use, an optimum is identified with a stable behaviour regarding the influences of parameter changes. In order to predict customer actions and behaviour via simulations, vehicle measurements were carried out and analysed, which leads to a well-sorted database of different driving styles, vehicle loads and driving environments. Based on this database, a statistical driving environment model as well as a statistical driver model was built up in MATLAB/Simulink. This allows simulating driving operations under real customer conditions for vehicles, i.e. hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and thus gaining representative results for fuel consumption and emissions. In addition, research is done on the effects of an optimised operation strategy for different driving cycles in comparison to the customer operation. It is shown that emissions in customer use differ significantly from those in driving cycles. The paper concludes with an analysis of the optimisation of emissions of an HEV during launch, using operation mode changes as an example.","","978-1-84919-911-7","10.1049/cp.2014.0942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103656","Hybrid vehicles;transient engine emissions;operation strategies;customer operation;operation mode changes","","air pollution control;carbon compounds;consumer behaviour;hybrid electric vehicles;nitrogen compounds;optimisation;soot;statistical analysis","HEV;fuel consumption;soot emission reduction;driving cycle operation;combustion engine;semiempiric approach;transient emission model;transient torque;customer behaviour;optimisation process;optimal operation strategy;OS;NEDC;WLTP;statistical driving environment model;hybrid electric vehicles;CO2;NOx","","","","","","11 May 2015","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This seminal book led to the last 25 years of work in geneticalgorithms (GAs) and related forms of evolutionary computation (EC). In recent years, the expansion of the Internet, other telecommunications technologies, and other large scale networks have led to a world where large numbers of semi-autonomous software entities (i.e., agents) will be interacting in an open, universal system. This development cast the importance of Holland's legacy in a new light. This paper argues that Holland's fundamental arguments, and the years of developments that have followed, have a direct impact on systems of general network agents, regardless of whether they explicitly exploit EC. However, it also argues that the techniques and theories of EC cannot be directly transferred to the world of general agents (rather than EC-specific) without examination of effects that are embodied in general software agents. This paper introduces a framework for EC interchanges between general-purpose software agents. Preliminary results are shown that illustrate the EC effects of asynchronous actions of agents within this framework. Building on this framework, coevolutionary agents that interact in a simulated producer/consumer economy are introduced. Using these preliminary results as illustrations, areas for future investigation of embodied EC software agents are discussed.","1063-6560","","10.1162/106365600568266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6788179","Genetic algorithms;agent-based systems;market-based systems;coevolution.","","","","","8","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel digital-to-analog converter (DAC) configuration that is calibrated using an artificial intelligence neural network technique. The proposed technique is demonstrated on an adaptive and self-calibrated binary-weighted DAC that can be configured on-chip in real time. We design a reconfigurable 4-bit DAC with a memristor-based neural network. This circuit uses an online supervised machine learning algorithm called “binary-weighted time-varying gradient descent.” This algorithm fits multiple full-scale voltage ranges and sampling frequencies by iterative synaptic adjustments, while inherently providing mismatch calibration and noise tolerance. Theoretical analysis, as well as simulation results, show the efficiency and robustness of the training algorithm in reconfiguration, self-calibration, and desensitization, leading to a significant improvement in DAC accuracy: 0.12 LSB in terms of integral non-linearity, 0.11 LSB in terms of differential non-linearity, and 3.63 bits in terms of effective number of bits. The findings constitute a promising milestone toward scalable data-driven converters using deep neural networks.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2017.2780251","Israeli Planning and Budgeting Committee Fellowship; Viterbi Fellowship at the Technion Computer Engineering Center; EU COST Action IC1401; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8168325","Adaptive systems;calibration;converters;memristors;neuromorphic computing;reconfigurable architectures;supervised learning","Memristors;Training;Algorithm design and analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Resistance;Circuits and systems","calibration;digital-analogue conversion;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);memristor circuits;neural chips","multiple full-scale voltage ranges;iterative synaptic adjustments;mismatch calibration;training algorithm;DAC accuracy;integral nonlinearity;deep neural networks;trainable integrated circuit;memristor;high-precision data converters;artificial intelligence neural network technique;online supervised machine learning algorithm;binary-weighted time-varying gradient descent;DIDACTIC;self-calibrated binary-weighted DAC;adaptive binary-weighted DAC;data-intelligent digital-to-analog converter configuration;sampling frequencies;noise tolerance;differential nonlinearity;data-driven converters;word length 3.63 bit;word length 4 bit","","10","","37","","6 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Toward Modularization of Neural Network Autonomous Driving Policy Using Parallel Attribute Networks","Z. Xu; H. Chang; C. Tang; C. Liu; M.

However, no matter using imitation learning or reinforcement learning, the network policies are generally hard to train, and the learned knowledge encoded in neural network policies are hard to transfer. We propose to modularize the complicated driving policies in terms of the driving attributes, and present the parallel attribute networks (PAN), which can learn to fullfill the requirements of the attributes in the driving tasks separately, and later assemble their knowledge together. Concretely, we first train a policy network that accomplish the base lane tracking attribute. The modules for the add-on attributes such as avoiding obstacles and obeying traffic rules are then trained to map the corresponding state to a satisfactory set of the vehicle action space. Finally the reference action given by the base policy is projected into the satisfactory sets so as to satisfy the requirements of all the attributes. Using the PAN, many complicated tasks that are hard to train from scratch can be easily trained; also unseen driving tasks can be solved in a zero-shot manner by assembling the pretrained attribute modules. We have validated the capability of our model on a class of autonomous driving problems with attributes of obstacle avoidance, traffic light and speed limit in simulation. Experimental results based on an obstacle avoidance task are also presented.","2642-7214","978-1-7281-0560-4","10.1109/IVS.2019.8813861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813861","","","collision avoidance;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","neural network autonomous driving policy;parallel attribute networks;imitation learning;learned knowledge;neural network policies;driving attributes;policy network;base lane tracking attribute;pretrained attribute modules;autonomous driving problems","","1","","14","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Contact resistance behavior of nanocrystalline copper and palladium films under fretting conditions","M. Braunovic; M. Trudeau; K. Bryden; J. Y.

Proceedings of the Forty-First IEEE Holm Conference on Electrical Contacts","6 Aug 2002","1995","","","71","82","The effect of fretting on the contact resistance behavior of nanocrystalline Cu and Pd films deposited on Cu, Ni, and Al plates in contact with Cu, Al and Sn-plated copper wire conductors was investigated. The tests were conducted with a simulated connector configuration using a differential thermal expansion fixture to produce a fretting motion of 30 /spl mu/m at a frequency of 0.005 Hz. In addition to the contact resistance measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence (EDX) analyses were used to study the processes involved. The results show that in practically all cases, the nanocrystalline Cu and Pd films had a beneficial effect on the contact resistance behavior as manifested by relatively small fluctuations of the contact resistance with fretting time. However, when the films were worn out by the fretting action, a rapid increase in the contact resistance was observed. SEM and EDX analyses of the worn contact zones revealed that these were damaged by fretting action and in some cases transfer of material was observed. However, this damage was considerably less pronounced than that observed when the base metals were subjected to the same fretting conditions. It is believed that the beneficial effect of nanocrystalline films is due to the improved mechanical properties of these films.","","0-7803-2728-4","10.1109/HOLM.1995.482862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=482862","","Contact resistance;Copper;Palladium;Scanning electron microscopy;Conductive films;Wire;Testing;Analytical models;Connectors;Thermal conductivity","copper;palladium;metallic thin films;metallic thin films;contact resistance;contact resistance;wear;wear;scanning electron microscopy;scanning electron microscopy;X-ray fluorescence analysis;X-ray fluorescence analysis;nanostructured materials;nanostructured materials;electrical contacts;electrical contacts","contact resistance behavior;nanocrystalline Cu films;nanocrystalline Pd films;fretting conditions;Cu plates;Ni plates;Al plates;Cu-plated Cu wire conductors;Al-plated Cu wire conductors;Sn-plated Cu wire conductors;scanning electron microscopy;SEM analysis;X-ray fluorescence analysis;EDX analysis;mechanical properties;0.005 Hz;30 micron;Cu-Cu-Cu;Ni;Cu;Al;Cu-Al-Cu;Cu-Sn-Cu;Pd-Cu-Cu;Pd-Al-Cu;Pd-Sn-Cu","","1","","33","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed current mirror uses MOS current dividers to sample the output current and a feedback action is used to force it to be equal to the input current; yielding very high impedance with a very large output voltage range. The proposed implementation yields an increase of the output impedance by a factor of about gmro compared with that of the super-Wilson current mirror, thus offering a potential solution to mitigate the effect of the low output impedance of ultra-deep submicron CMOS transistors used in sub 1-V current mirrors and current sources. A NMOS version of the proposed current mirror circuit was implemented using STMicroelectronics 1-V 90-nm CMOS process and simulated using Spectre to validate its performance. The output current is mirrored with a transfer error lower than 1% down to an output voltage as low as 80 mV for an input current of 5 muA, and 111 mV when the input current is increased to 50 muA.","","978-1-4244-2342-2","10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4746105","","Impedance;Mirrors;Analog circuits;Low voltage;Collision mitigation;Force feedback;Threshold voltage;Operational amplifiers;CMOS process;CMOS technology","analogue circuits;biomedical electronics;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;mirrors","very-high output impedance current mirror;very-low voltage biomedical analog circuits;MOS current dividers;super-Wilson current mirror;NMOS;CMOS process","","17","","9","","9 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"STEM collaboration in virtual world academy","L. Divine; R. Williams","Virtual Reality Academy Deputy Director, Tec^Edge Innovation and Collaboration Center, Dayton, Ohio, United States; AFRL Discovery Lab Director, Tec^Edge Innovation and Collaboration Center, Dayton, Ohio, United States","2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","25 Jul 2013","2013","","","569","575","There is general agreement about the importance of increasing the number of students choosing career fields in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). However most of the initiatives designed to get students interested in STEM fields are constrained by floor space, budget, or driving distance. These factors, in combination, act to limit the affordability and accessibility of research opportunities in STEM fields to students in schools faced with increasingly limited budgets or lacking access to experienced STEM teachers. Since a trained STEM workforce is crucial to tackling research challenges of importance to the Air Force and the nation, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Discovery Lab program has developed a Virtual Reality Academy (VRA) program utilizing open source virtual reality software, Open Simulator, to create a virtual collaboration environment called Virtual (reality) Discovery Center (VDC). This 16-region VDC is the key to the Discovery Lab's 1,000 Student Outreach initiative designed to greatly expand the Discovery Lab's ability to make project-based “hands-on” research experience accessible to students across the country via the Open Simulator collaboration technologies. This paper highlights many of the successful efforts to establish VDC Virtual Learning Academies in areas such as Biology, Nanotechnology, Computer Vision, and Mobile Computing (smartphone apps). This paper is not a scientific study of Open Simulator as a collaboration tool for STEM but rather a descriptive overview of its successful implementation locally and nationally - suggesting its potential as a game-changer in STEM education and research.","","978-1-4673-6404-1","10.1109/CTS.2013.6567288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567288","","Collaboration;Solid modeling;Dinosaurs;Avatars;Educational institutions;Space shuttles","computer aided instruction;engineering education;groupware;public domain software;teaching;virtual reality","STEM collaboration;science-technology-engineering-mathematics;STEM fields;driving distance;floor space;STEM teachers;STEM workforce;Air Force Research Laboratory Discovery Lab program;Virtual Reality Academy program;VRA program;open source virtual reality software;virtual collaboration environment;Virtual Discovery Center;16-region VDC;project-based hands-on research experience;Open Simulator collaboration technologies;virtual learning academies","","1","","6","","25 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hybrid strategies were adopted for training the networks. They used deterministic methods, such as conjugate gradient and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms, combined with a stochastic method, simulated annealing. The system deals with digital images with an unknown number of unoccluded object types and poses. Results show that, in this case, artificial neural networks had better generalization capability than k-NN; despite geometrical transformations and other degradations over the images.

We first formulate the above problem as a Markov decision process, and then propose a double deep Q-network (DQN)-based subcarrier-power allocation algorithm to learn the optimal policy in the absence of full instantaneous channel state information (CSI). Specifically, each D2D pair acts as a learning agent that adjusts its own subcarrier-power allocation strategy iteratively through interactions with the operating environment in a trial-and-error fashion. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves near optimal performance in real time. It is worth mentioning that the proposed algorithm is especially suitable for the case where the environmental dynamics is not accurate and the CSI delay cannot be ignored.","2576-8565","978-89-950043-8-8","10.23919/APNOMS50412.2020.9237060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9237060","D2D;spectral efciency;deep reinforcement learning;DDQN;power control;subcarrier assignment","Cellular networks;Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Device-to-device communication;Temperature control;Resource management","5G mobile communication;cellular radio;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;multi-agent systems;OFDM modulation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","multiagent reinforcement learning;resource allocation;D2D Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks;device-to-device communications;fifth generation cellular system;spectrum efficiency;system capacity;deep reinforcement learning;joint subcarrier assignment;multiple D2D pairs;multiple subcarriers;Markov decision process;double deep Q-network-based subcarrier-power allocation algorithm;instantaneous channel state information;learning agent;subcarrier-power allocation strategy","","","","13","","23 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the objective of this paper is to propose an online learning and adaptive scheme using a dynamic neural network. It is demonstrated in this paper that the proposed scheme, taking the desired Cartesian coordinates as the inputs, determines the robot joint angles and makes the robot reach the desired position, thereby achieving learning and performing actions together.

The student spends several hours of a day in the presence of the teacher and can talk, express doubts and pose questions. These doubts, or the general feeling towards the object of learning, are not only expressed explicitly but also implicitly. Indeed, the teacher is constantly, even if in an unconscious way, reading the state of the student in search for sings of doubt, frustration, stress or fatigue. This information is then used by the teacher to adapt their methods or to personalize their approach in function of each student. These aspects, intuitively central in education, become less efficient when learning takes place in a Virtual Environment. Indeed, the growth of online courses, in which the student and the teacher often never even meet, make learning more difficult for a number of reasons.

Different from the existing methods, the objective function consists of three terms, including the product of the control quantity and the error of the previous control process. Based on the objective function, the predictive iterative learning control (ILC) law is derived by using the design method of generalized predictive control (GPC) without specifying ILC law form in advance. An on-line identification method for model parameters is given to realize effective identification under a small amount of data circumstances, and therefore, the parameters of controller are adjusted adaptively according to the identification results. The proposed control method is validated both in simulation and experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed predictive iterative learning control strategy can obtain better control effect than GPC, and has more obvious characteristics of iterative learning control. It can maintain the expected performance under the condition of intermittent loading and replacing the motor.

In the definition of this concept, general dynamical system theory is used. The framework is able to learn the dynamics (models) of a reconfigurable system, select appropriate models, and ultimately control the plant according to given specifications. The framework design borrows concepts and techniques from the active fields of adaptive and learning control.

Utilizing high-fidelity nonlinear 6-DOF aircraft simulations, it is shown that several modifications in existing imitation learning techniques must be considered. DAgger algorithm when applied sequentially to augment data along the desired flight trajectory to train the ANN autopilot is unable to generalize across turning and straight-line maneuvers, and hence cannot learn to fly stably, eventually terminating the simulation. Monte-Carlo methods when incorporated into the DAgger algorithm allow for sampling of random data along the desired flight trajectory, proved to be effective to train the ANN autopilot to fly indefinitely with acceptable tracking errors, however undesirable low frequency oscillations were observed in control input and aircraft states. The oscillatory behavior is dealt with by introducing a time-based moving window along the trajectory for data addition in conjunction with the standard DAgger algorithm. Different variations of DAgger algorithms are tested and compared using closed-loop 6-DOF flight simulations. 3D trajectory tracking and stability in aircraft states are evaluated with evidence supporting the idea that an ANN autopilot can behave as a unified GNC system and fly a fixed-wing UAS.","2575-7296","978-1-7281-4278-4","10.1109/ICUAS48674.2020.9213850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9213850","Machine Learning;Neural Networks;DAgger;UAS;Guidance;Navigation;Control;Monte-Carlo;McDAg-ger;MwDAgger","Aircraft;Biological neural networks;Atmospheric modeling;Training;Aircraft navigation;Aerospace control","adaptive control;aerospace computing;aerospace control;aerospace simulation;aircraft control;autonomous aerial vehicles;control system synthesis;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;Monte Carlo methods;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;path planning;position control;stability","fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems;artificial neural network autopilot;supervised learning techniques;imitation learning framework;data aggregation;ANN autopilot;fixed-wing UAS;standard dagger algorithm;unified GNC system;aircraft states;flight trajectory;imitation learning techniques;high-fidelity nonlinear 6-DOF aircraft simulations","","","","50","","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The magnitude of these gains is anyways often strongly limited by the control bandwidth. In this paper, we show how to reduce the required contribution of the feedback controller by incorporating learned task-space reference accelerations. Thus, we i) improve the execution of the given specific task, and ii) offer the means to reduce feedback gains, providing for greater compliance of the system. In contrast to learning task-specific joint-torques, which might produce a similar effect but can lead to poor generalization, our approach directly learns the task-space dynamics of the center of mass of a humanoid robot.

Sample collection for robotics application is a time-consuming process in addition to safety issues for both the robot itself and the environment surrounding it that come into play for real-world scenarios. Because of these limitations, sample efficiency plays a very vital role in the field of robotic learning. To deal with this, curriculum learning offers a methodology that allows robots to suffer less from the sample collection burden required, trying to keep it at a minimum. This study aims to tackle the sample inefficiency that deep reinforcement learning algorithms face in the domain of robotics by designing a curriculum. We propose an algorithm which decides on the sequence of tasks that the agent must learn to enable the transfer of knowledge in a sample-efficient manner towards the target task. Our algorithm performs a parameter-space task representation for the purpose of deciding on the difficultiness of the tasks. Once the difficulty level of each is determined, easy tasks are learned first before the final target task. We perform a study on a double inverted pendulum setup.

It is motivated to address two issues in the current clinical settings: 1) short of clinical resources with the prevalence of ASD (1.7% in the United States), and 2) subjectivity of ASD screening. This work differentiates itself with three unique features: first, it proposes an ASD screening with privileged modality framework that integrates information from two behavioral modalities during training and improves the performance on each single modality at testing. The proposed framework does not require overlap in subjects between the modalities. Second, it develops the first computational model to classify people with ASD using a photo-taking task where subjects freely explore their environment in a more ecological setting. Photo-taking reveals attentional preference of subjects, differentiating people with ASD from healthy people, and is also easy to implement in real-world clinical settings without requiring advanced diagnostic instruments. Third, this study for the first time takes advantage of the temporal information in eye movements while viewing images, encoding more detailed behavioral differences between ASD people and healthy controls. Experiments show that our ASD screening models can achieve superior performance, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Moreover, our framework using diverse modalities demonstrates performance improvement on both the photo-taking and image-viewing tasks, providing a general paradigm that takes in multiple sources of behavioral data for a more accurate ASD screening. The framework is also applicable to various scenarios where one-to-one pairwise relationship is difficult to obtain across different modalities.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010066","","Task analysis;Variable speed drives;Visualization;Computational modeling;Training;Testing;Biological system modeling","cognition;eye;feature extraction;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical disorders","diverse modalities;ASD screening models;ASD people;real-world clinical settings;photo-taking reveals attentional preference;photo-taking task;single modality;behavioral modalities;privileged modality framework;clinical resources;clinical settings;quantitative screening;automatic screening;autism spectrum disorder screening","","1","","37","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These automatic adjustments of task difficulty or the degree of assistance can be used to promote not only motor skill learning but also neuromotor recovery.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-9862-8","10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975375","robot-therapy;motor skill learning;guidance;shaping","Robots;Noise;Robustness;Adaptation models;Training;Process control;Bayesian methods","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;psychology;virtual reality","adaptive regulation;robot-assisted motor skill learning;neurorehabilitation;Bayesian mechanism;psychophysical thresholds;task difficulty;automatic adjustments;neuromotor recovery","Bayes Theorem;Humans;Learning;Models, Theoretical;Motor Skills;Robotics","15","","32","","11 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, deep learning (DL), one of the most advanced classification algorithms, has been applied into AMC. However, these previously proposed AMC methods are centralized in nature, i.e., all training data must be collected together to train the same neural network. In addition, they are generally based on powerful computing devices and may not be suitable for edge devices. Thus, a distributed learning-based AMC (DistAMC) method is proposed, which relies on the cooperation of multiple edge devices and model averaging (MA) algorithm. When compared with the centralized AMC (CentAMC), there are two advantages of the DistAMC: the higher training efficiency and the lower computing overhead, which are very consistent with the characteristics of edge devices. Simulation results show that there are slight performance gap between the DistAMC and the CentAMC, and they also have similar convergence speed, but the consumed training time per epoch in the former method will be shorter than that on the latter method, if the low latency and the high bandwidth are considered in model transmission process of the DistAMC. Moreover, the DistAMC can combine the computing power of multiple edge devices to reduce the computing overhead of a single edge device in the CentAMC.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2020.3016822","Project Funded by the Major Project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China; Six Top Talents Program of Jiangsu; 1311 Talent Plan of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9167279","Automatic modulation classification (AMC);deep learning (DL);distributed learning;edge device;model averaging (MA)","Modulation;Training;Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Data models;Machine learning;Acceleration","learning (artificial intelligence);modulation;neural nets;pattern classification;telecommunication computing","automatic modulation classification;deep learning;advanced classification algorithms;training data;computing devices;distributed learning-based AMC method;DistAMC;multiple edge devices;model averaging algorithm;centralized AMC;CentAMC;consumed training time;single edge device;neural network;MA algorithm;computing overhead;training efficiency;model transmission process","","4","","21","IEEE","14 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tracking problem considered concerns the case when the tracking-error dynamics are described by a set of time-varying nonlinear differential equations, which are periodic in time with a known period. Our iterative update scheme is based on the specific property that the learning system tends to oscillate in steady state. In fact, our approach extends in a very natural manner the idea of the well-known iterative learning control for the case of finite-time tracking problems to the case of infinite-time asymptotic tracking problems. The best advantage of the proposed leaning approach is that it is computationally simple and does not require one to solve any complicated equations based on full system dynamics. We explore the conditions under which a periodic nonlinear system exhibits a steady-state oscillation. Our work also can be viewed to provide a learning-based solution to the input-state inversion problem. The generality and practicality of our work is demonstrated through rigorous performance analysis and simulation using a robot manipulator.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.887624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887624","","Nonlinear systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Steady-state;Differential equations;Learning systems;Iterative methods;Nonlinear equations;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Robots","nonlinear control systems;nonlinear differential equations;tracking;learning systems;time-varying systems","asymptotic state tracking;learning-based inversion;tracking-error dynamics;time-varying nonlinear differential equations;iterative update scheme;iterative learning control;finite-time tracking problems;infinite-time asymptotic tracking problems;input-state inversion problem;performance analysis;robot manipulator","","31","","29","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The efficiency of the use of radio spectrum for wireless communications can be dramatically increased by dynamic secondary spectrum sharing; an intelligent approach that allows unlicensed devices access to those parts of the spectrum that are otherwise underutilized by the incumbent users. In this paper, we propose a heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning (HARL)-based framework, designed for dynamic secondary spectrum sharing in Long Term Evolution cellular systems. It utilizes a radio environment map as external information for guiding the learning process of cognitive cellular systems. System level simulations of a stadium temporary event scenario show that the schemes based on the proposed HARL framework achieve high controllability of spectrum sharing patterns in a fully autonomous way. This results in a significant decrease in the primary system quality of service degradation due to interference from the secondary cognitive systems, compared with a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solution and a purely heuristic typical LTE solution. The spectrum sharing patterns that emerge by using the proposed schemes also result in remarkable reliability of the cognitive eNodeB on the aerial platform. Furthermore, the novel principle and the general structure of heuristic functions proposed in the context of HARL are applicable to a wide range of self-organization problems beyond the wireless communications domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2507158","Seventh Framework Programme within the European Commission through the ABSOLUTE Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350209","Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning;Spectrum Sharing;Dynamic Spectrum Access;Heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning;spectrum sharing;dynamic spectrum access","Heuristic algorithms;Learning (artificial intelligence);Wireless communication;Acceleration;Decision support systems;Mobile communication;Interference","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;quality of service;radio spectrum management;telecommunication computing","heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning process;dynamic secondary spectrum sharing;flexible cellular system architectures;radio spectrum management techniques;mobile data capacity;intelligent approach;HARL-based framework;Long Term Evolution cellular systems;radio environment map;cognitive cellular systems;stadium temporary event scenario;system level simulations;system quality of service degradation;heuristic typical LTE solution;cognitive eNodeB;aerial platform;wireless communications domain;self-organization problems","","15","","36","","9 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is based on a combination of variational inference and loopy belief propagation, where data is only communicated between neighboring nodes without the need for a fusion center. We show that for tree structured networks, under certain parameterization, dSBL coincides with centralized sparse Bayesian learning (cSBL). For general loopy networks, dSBL and cSBL are differend, yet simulations show much faster convergence over the variational inference iterations at similar sparsity and mean squared error performance.

To this end, we create 3D virtual environments of living rooms, different human characters and interior textures. Beside capturing fisheye images from virtual environments we create annotations for semantic segmentation, instance masks and bounding boxes for object detection. We compare our synthetic dataset to state of the art real-world datasets for omnidirectional images. Based on MS COCO weights, we show that our dataset is well suited for fine-tuning CNNs for object detection and semantic segmentation. Through a high generalization of our models by means of image synthesis and domain randomization we reach a AP up to 0.90 for class person on our own annotated fisheye evaluation suite (FES). Additionally, the evaluation of six classes was done through object detection and semantic segmentation on FES. The segmentation task on FES leads to 0.36 mIoU on all classes and to a mAP of 0.61 for the object detection.","2642-9381","978-1-7281-6553-0","10.1109/WACV45572.2020.9093563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093563","","Cameras;Image segmentation;Object detection;Three-dimensional displays;Semantics;Solid modeling;Rendering (computer graphics)","convolutional neural nets;image resolution;image segmentation;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;solid modelling;virtual reality","THEODORE;synthetic omnidirectional top-view indoor dataset;deep transfer learning;synthetic indoor datasets;perspective views;object detection;convolutional neural networks;large-scale indoor dataset;3D virtual environment;semantic segmentation;instance masks;bounding boxes;synthetic dataset;omnidirectional images;CNNs;image synthesis;domain randomization;annotated fisheye evaluation suite;high-resolution diversified fisheye images","","","","49","","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We will present a first approach on how Smart Glasses can be used as an experimental tool for head-centered, context-aware, wearable-technology-enhanced, and inquiry-based learning in physics education. Therefore, we developed an app that is based on the Google Glass platform and designed to perform educational physical experiments on the topic of acoustics. Its initial application is intended for high-school students whose task is to study the relationship between the frequency of the sound generated by hitting a glass of water and the amount of water in the glass. The core idea is to have Google Glass automatically measure both the water fill level with the camera and the sound frequency with the microphone, and incrementally generate a fill level/frequency graph in the HMD. We designed an educational setting and studied its effect on cognitive and affective variables with an intervention-control-group design. While the intervention group analyzed the fill level/frequency relationship with the Google Glass platform, control group 1 worked on the phenomenon using the same platform implemented on a tablet PC. Control group 2 analyzed the phenomenon using a tablet PC with a typical mobile-based education platform. We used a two-way ANCOVA to study learning outcome, wondering, curiosity, cognitive load, and experimentation time as dependent variables of 46 high-school eighth-graders together with group membership and gender influence as independent variables. While the positive effects of using Google Glass as a mobile lab on wondering and curiosity as well as a positive trend for experimentation time were detected, no differences were analyzed for learning achievement. Although students have a higher cognitive load when working with Google Glass compared to other devices, the cognitive load level is very low in general.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2016.2554115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452644","Wearable computers;physics education;student experiments;acoustic measurements;wearable sensors;image recognition","Smart devices;Google;Sensors;Wearable computing;Mobile computers;Glasses","cameras;computer aided instruction;helmet mounted displays;microphones;mobile computing;notebook computers;physics computing;physics education;student experiments;wearable computers","fill level/frequency relationship;tablet PC;mobile-based education platform;two-way ANCOVA;learning outcome;wondering;curiosity;cognitive load;experimentation time;high-school eighth-graders;group membership;gender influence;mobile lab;intervention-control-group design;affective variables;cognitive variables;educational setting;fill level/frequency graph;microphone;camera;water fill level;sound frequency;high-school students;educational physical experiments;Google Glass platform;physics education;inquiry-based learning;wearable-technology-enhanced learning;sensor-based experiments;contact-free experiments;HMD;classical head-mounted displays;mobile computers;context-aware learning;head-centered learning;smart glasses;gPhysics","","23","","55","","14 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The agent receives visual information through raw pixels and a natural language instruction telling what task needs to be achieved and is trained in an end-to-end way. We develop an attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion of visual and textual modalities that allows the agent to learn to complete the task and achieve language grounding. Our experimental results show that our attention mechanism outperforms the existing multi-modal fusion mechanisms proposed for both 2D and 3D environments in order to solve the above-mentioned task in terms of both speed and accuracy. We show that the learnt textual representations are semantically meaningful as they follow vector arithmetic in the embedding space. The effectiveness of our attention approach over the contemporary fusion mechanisms is also highlighted from the textual embeddings learnt by the different approaches. We also show that our model generalizes effectively to unseen scenarios and exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities both in 2D and 3D environments.

Augmented Reality (AR) is a digital resource that acts as a way of visualizing virtual elements, often three-dimensional (3D), together with the real environment. AR offers ""enormous educational potential"" when used in conjunction with gamification. This work aims to implement a gamified project using augmented reality to assist in the learning process of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The project was implemented in ""Cri.Ativa"", the psycho-pedagogical care room of a child development center that provides multidisciplinary care for children with atypical development (especially for children on the autism spectrum) in Palmas, Brazil. In general, it is considered that the objective of the work was achieved because the desired process was gamified and the results obtained by its implementation were positive. However, it is important to highlight that, due to the huge number of possible characteristics for children with ASD, this result does not demonstrate that the application of the described process will have equally positive outcomes in all contexts.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274271","Autism Spectrum Disorder;Autism;Augmented Reality;Gamification","Games;Education;Augmented reality;Autism;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Tools","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;handicapped aids;medical disorders;teaching","gamified process;learning process;autistic people;augmented reality;gamified project;Autism Spectrum Disorder;psycho-pedagogical care room;AssociAR;ASD","","","","33","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The optimal control algorithm has been developed using the ideas from reinforcement learning (RL). The decentralized control design does not need the model information of the DERs, and the optimal control gains can be computed using the measurements of the DER states and its terminal voltage variables. The DER terminal voltages act as interaction variables with the rest of the grid, and the algorithm computes an optimal gain taking these interaction variables into consideration. Assuming sufficient coupling of DERs to the synchronous machine states, the controller improves the dynamics of DER states, which in turn enhances the oscillation characteristics of the power grid.

In the second, scripts underlying the schematics and algorithms just introduced demonstrate their behavior. In the third, the learner interacts with properly designed tools to practice and test her/his level of proficiency. Network and algorithm design and analysis are the targets of the last methodology, based on the use of custom-built general purpose simulators.

Performing an adequate control using conventional control techniques, that require the model of the plant and some knowledge about the influence of the environment, could be almost impossible. An alternative to traditional control techniques is to use an automatic learning system that uses previous experience to learn an adequate control policy. Learning by experience has been formalized in the field of reinforcement learning. But the application of reinforcement learning techniques in complex environments is only feasible when some generalization can be made in order to reduce the required amount of experience. This work presents an algorithm that performs a kind of generalization called categorization. This algorithm is able to perform efficient generalization of the observed situations, and learn accurate control policies in a short time without any previous knowledge of the plant and without the need of any kind of traditional control technique. Its performance is evaluated on the trajectory tracking control with simulated DC motors and compared with PID systems specifically tuned for the same problem.","","0-7803-8463-6","10.1109/IROS.2004.1389956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1389956","","Trajectory;Automatic control;Control systems;Legged locomotion;Learning;Industrial control;Service robots;Three-term control;Application software;Control system synthesis","position control;learning (artificial intelligence);robots;learning systems","trajectory tracking control;rotational joint;feature-based categorization learning;real world robot applications;automatic learning system;reinforcement learning","","","","12","","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This formulation allows the application of powerful numerical methods to problems at a high-level of performance measurement: the task level. Task-level learning is studied as a paradigm than may help to program machines to learn from experience in order to: (1) perform a task better over time, (2) optimize task performance, and (3) generalize knowledge over tasks.

However, these programs are expensive, resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and reachability, leading to limited take-up and short-term impact. Digital Health Intervention (DHI) programs incorporate the use of technology - mobile, web, wearables, virtual and augmented reality - to address these limitations while being more cost-effective. DHIs have shown major success in improving physical and mental health outcomes for the general public as well as reducing adverse outcomes or high-risk groups. However, it is still very challenging and expensive to design and run high quality mobile-based DHI programs, in part due to the lack of technical skills of researchers in this field. Our proposed mobile eHealth Learning and Intervention Platform (eHeLP) aims to address these challenges with a novel approach that allows health researchers to focus on their studies, and participants to have access to multiple health programs that meet their needs. The platform caters for identified stakeholders in the DHI field and encourages the development of a new health-tech industry.

For this purpose, we design a geographical position information learning (GPI-Learning) algorithm to learn the GPI relationship between users and UAVs. This approach consumes less time by avoiding calculation of exact channels and fills a gap existed in the scenario of setting multi-UAV rapidly to serve multi-user. Without loss of generality, we apply GPI-Learning in different scenarios, such as changes in user number or area size.

A set of 39 pictures of four ship models in various positions was collected. The pictures were preprocessed to remove position and scale variations. In each picture (40*100 pixels) the ship image extended to both sides of the picture or from top to bottom. A subset of these pictures was used to train a large neural network (NN) using the generalized delta rule learning algorithm. The NN was tested on both the original images and simulated mirror images of the ships. When the maximum output from both presentations was used for making a classification decision, the NN successfully recognized the ships in all positions. It is observed that using first-layer weights initialized to zero produces faster learning and better performance than networks using only randomized weights.<>","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=118321","","Pattern recognition;Learning systems;Neural networks","computerised pattern recognition;learning systems;neural nets","computerised pattern recognition;learning systems;training;neural networks;ship image recognition;generalized delta rule learning algorithm;simulated mirror images;classification decision;first-layer weights;40 pixels;100 pixels;4000 pixels","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are still open questions: (1) the gap between simulated and real environments, (2) the evolutionary and learning phase are completely separated, and (3) the conflict between stability and evolvability/adaptability. In this paper, we try to overcome these problems by incorporating the concept of dynamic rearrangement function of biological neural networks with the use of neuromodulators.

It is not rare that those data are grouped into categories (also called classes). Thus, one of the goals of a learning algorithm is to find out and understand how to assign new, previously unknown data to the correct class. But, in many cases data is available or can be gathered at low costs, whereas acquiring the corresponding category (or class) involves high costs. This is precisely where active learning (AL) comes into its own: In order to reduce the annotation costs, it allows the learning system to deliberately select the samples which should be annotated. Subsequently, the selected samples are presented to an entity (e.g., humans, simulation systems, etc.), generally addressed under the term oracle, that provides the corresponding classes. Afterwards, the knowledge base of the learner is updated and, depending on a stopping criterion, new labels are queried or not. Such a system is self-aware of its own imperfection, thus, it uses a selection strategy to determine the next most informative sample. Hitherto, it has been shown that AL is a powerful paradigm that evinces the desired results, provided that the oracles are omniscient. But, human oracles are prone to error, so for that reason we can ask ourself: Does AL still work with error prone and uncertain human annotators? In this article we present the results of an active learning case study conducted on 30000 images labeled by two humans and propose a new type of labeling for better solving AL problems with error-prone annotators.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489394","","Labeling;Uncertainty;Training;Measurement uncertainty;Support vector machines;Learning systems;Cameras","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems","realistic data;machine learning systems;learning algorithm;unknown data;annotation costs;simulation systems;selection strategy;human oracles;error-prone annotators;active learning","","2","","27","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of existing work assumed independent primary channels with the knowledge of network dynamics. However, the channels are usually correlated and network dynamics is unknown a-priori. This entails a great challenge on the sensing policy design for spectrum opportunity tracking, and the conventional partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation with model-based solutions are generally inapplicable. In this paper, we take a different approach, and formulate the sensing policy design as a time-series POMDP from a model-free perspective. To solve this time-series POMDP, we propose a novel Gaussian process reinforcement learning (GPRL) based solution. It achieves accurate channel selection and a fast learning rate. In essence, GP is embedded in RL as a Q-function approximator to efficiently utilize the past learning experience. A novel kernel function is first tailor designed to measure the correlation of time-series spectrum data. Then a covariance-based exploration strategy is developed to enable a proactive exploration for better policy learning. Finally, for GPRL to adapt to multichannel sensing, we propose a novel action-trimming method to reduce the computational cost. Our simulation results show that the designed sensing policy outperforms existing ones, and can obtain a near-optimal performance within a short learning phase.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2020.2986354","ARC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064881","Opportunistic spectrum access;sensing policy;Gaussian process reinforcement learning (GPRL);machine learning","Sensors;Correlation;Kernel;Gaussian processes;Learning (artificial intelligence);Radio frequency;Training","cognitive radio;function approximation;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;telecommunication computing","spectrum demand;future-generation wireless networks;independent primary channels;network dynamics;sensing policy design;spectrum opportunity tracking;conventional partially observable Markov decision process formulation;model-based solutions;time-series POMDP;model-free perspective;Gaussian process reinforcement learning based solution;GPRL;accurate channel selection;fast learning rate;Q-function approximator;past learning experience;time-series spectrum data;covariance-based exploration strategy;policy learning;designed sensing policy;short learning phase;fast opportunistic spectrum access","","","","42","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hands-on class activities effectively convey an understanding of a complex model without equations. Computer simulations promote visual comprehensions for highly dynamic systems. In our course, general ecology for biologists, mathematical complexity is a crucial element required for transitioning from the real world to the world of numbers pertaining both linear and non-linear relationships. We designed indoor activities to initiate analytical thinking and to extend appreciations of outdoor experiences to abstract reasoning in numerical terms and computer models. Our approach fulfills the objectives of guiding biology students to construct scenarios reflecting complex interactions among organisms in the natural world. They overcame their primarily negative mindset, feeling intimidated by mathematics and uncomfortably unfamiliar with computer technology. To evaluate our teaching method, students were asked to qualitatively write an after action evaluation. They expressed enjoyment in their learning. Though struggling at times, the experience was very rewarding and worthwhile. Students came to a realization of the importance of mathematics and information literacy skills, while drawing appreciation and awareness from outdoor experiences.

We introduce a deep geometry-aware grasping network (DGGN) that decomposes the learning into two steps. First, we learn to build mental geometry-aware representation by reconstructing the scene (i.e., 3D occupancy grid) from RGBD input via generative 3D shape modeling. Second, we learn to predict grasping outcome with its internal geometry-aware representation. The learned outcome prediction model is used to sequentially propose grasping solutions via analysis-by-synthesis optimization. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) To best of our knowledge, we are presenting for the first time a method to learn a 6-DOF grasping net from RGBD input; (2) We build a grasping dataset from demonstrations in virtual reality with rich sensory and interaction annotations. This dataset includes 101 everyday objects spread across 7 categories, additionally, we propose a data augmentation strategy for effective learning; (3) We demonstrate that the learned geometry-aware representation leads to about 10% relative performance improvement over the baseline CNN on grasping objects from our dataset.

A general worldwide trend is the development of distance learning sites and virtual laboratories, which are providing state-of-the-art education in all possible areas and are coexisting with the available on-site and in-person courses and subjects. In the Internet-oriented 21st century many university students have turned to and prefer these electronic and virtual educational resources, not only as additional learning options, but also as primary means for obtaining the latest educational materials by the leading university lecturers worldwide. This process has presented one of the major challenges for the available virtual learning environments - how to make it possible for the students to access, use and work with real equipment. In this paper we present our vision for a virtual laboratory which will provide the possibility for the students to access remotely and in real time the available laboratory set of telecommunication devices. In the Introduction section of the paper we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the available virtual learning environments. In the next Section we introduce the general conceptual model of the planned laboratory and later we present the actual structure and the organizational requirements for its implementation.

As has been the case in other countries around the world, teachers have generally supported the intentions of the curriculum in relation to inquiry pedagogy but, in the face of high stakes assessment and other issues, have struggled to implement it appropriately in classroom teaching. Interactive simulations -- computer-based 'virtual experiments' in which students can enter values and both observe and record the results -- have considerable potential for supporting teachers' use of inquiry approaches to the development of concepts in physics. This paper outlines the Chinese context of the study along with a novel instructional sequence developed and tested by the authors for the purpose of scaffolding inquiry instruction using interactive simulations. The paper describes a pilot study of the classroom use of the ISIS instructional sequence, including measurement of students' development of physics concepts, their confidence in their own understanding and their development of the skills of scientific inquiry. The sequence was found to be effective for conceptual development.","","978-1-4799-4230-5","10.1109/EITT.2014.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982588","physics;interactive simulations;inquiry learning;conceptual development","Context;Educational institutions;Force;Computational modeling;Standards","computer aided instruction;digital simulation;educational courses;educational institutions;physics education;teaching;virtual reality","instructional sequence for interactive simulations;ISIS;physics education;Chinese curricular reform;inquiry learning;classroom teaching;computer-based virtual experiments","","","","35","","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the data-based constrained optimal control problem of nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems has rarely been studied yet. To solve this problem, an adaptive optimal control approach is developed by using the value iteration-based Q-learning (VIQL) with the critic-only structure. Most of the existing constrained control methods require the use of a certain performance index and only suit for linear or affine nonlinear systems, which is unreasonable in practice. To overcome this problem, the system transformation is first introduced with the general performance index. Then, the constrained optimal control problem is converted to an unconstrained optimal control problem. By introducing the action-state value function, i.e., Q-function, the VIQL algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal Q-function of the data-based unconstrained optimal control problem. The convergence results of the VIQL algorithm are established with an easy-to-realize initial condition Q(0)(x, a) ≥ 0. To implement the VIQL algorithm, the critic-only structure is developed, where only one neural network is required to approximate the Q-function. The converged Q-function obtained from the critic-only VIQL method is employed to design the adaptive constrained optimal controller based on the gradient descent scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed adaptive control method is tested on three examples with computer simulation.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2751018","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057603","Adaptive control;adaptive dynamic programming;constraints;critic-only;data-based;optimal control;Q-learning","Optimal control;Performance analysis;Nonlinear systems;Discrete-time systems;Dynamic programming;Learning (artificial intelligence);Mathematical model","adaptive control;control system synthesis;discrete time systems;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;nonlinear control systems;performance index","critic-only structure;control methods;VIQL algorithm;optimal Q-function;adaptive constrained optimal controller design;data-based nonlinear discrete-time systems;reinforcement learning;nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems;value iteration-based Q-learning;linear onlinear systems;affine nonlinear systems;action-state value function;data-based unconstrained optimal control problem;neural network;gradient descent scheme;computer simulation;performance index","","20","","66","","3 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the parameter convergence issue in a nonlinear adaptive control systems, a novel exponential stability theorem is developed and can be further applied to more multiple-variable systems as well as to the time-delay systems. Firstly, the exponential stability of the states of the closed-loop nominal systems is obtained. Then, the exponential convergence of the neural weight is achieved as long as the corresponding persistent excitation (PE) condition is satisfied. The uncertain dynamics of the systems is learned and stored in a constant weight neural network, which can be implemented to control the systems. The simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.","2164-4357","978-1-4244-9442-2","10.1109/ICIST.2011.5765184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765184","","Stability analysis;Orbits;Radial basis function networks;Approximation methods;Control systems;Asymptotic stability;Adaptive systems","adaptive control;asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;delays;learning systems;multivariable control systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems","neural learning control;general Brunovsky system;exponential stability theorem;deterministic learning;adaptive neural control;nonlinear adaptive control system;multiple-variable system;time delay system;closed loop nominal system;persistent excitation condition;uncertain dynamics;constant weight neural network","","1","","20","","10 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this problem, the input patterns can be clustered into four groups indexed by their distances from the class boundary. With various combinations of these groups, the authors constructed training sets ranging from those containing only typical patterns of each class to those of border patterns. A series of simulation experiments were carried out to study the generalization capability of networks trained with these sets. The results are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) larger sizes of training examples do not guarantee better generalization performance: (2) there exists a proper subset of border patterns, which constitutes a critical training set for perfect generalization; and (3) a network trained with an arbitrary subset of border sets is not necessarily a better performer compared with one trained with a typical or other collection of input patterns","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1990.137836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5726794","","","learning systems;neural nets","back-propagation networks;feed-forward neural networks;generalization properties;nontrivial computation task;simulation experiments;training sets","","22","","8","","15 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proteomics education can be bridged with technology enhancements such that tool support for protein structures experiments. Generally, students in proteomics require different tools with unique processing methods for a given sequence, that makes the learning process challenging and time-consuming. Without an efficient teaching platform to conduct experiments, simulate algorithms and visualize outputs can cause lack of interest over time and can adversely impact on active student participation. This paper presents a novel concept by utilizing a workflow tool to support teaching and learning of bioinformatics. The tool facilitates to conduct experiments, execute various algorithms and visualize outputs to derive conclusions taught during lectures. The research outcome was evaluated using a task-sheet which examined the student's understanding of the proteomics processing such as protein search, alignment and annotation. The results demonstrated a significant gain in understanding, which was reflected through the student answers for the task sheet.

Fault diagnosis deliveries significant benefits to machines with rolling element bearings by finding the faults at early period and taking corrective actions to enhance safe and high performance operations. However, multiple sensor usages and high rate data acquisition involved in a monitoring system have considerable drawbacks of high system cost involved in purchasing hardware for data transfer, storage and processing. To reduce these shortages, this paper investigates compressive sensing (CS) techniques for the fault detection of rolling element bearings. Based on the frequency shift and envelope analysis, a CS scheme is developed for monitoring the bearing. The number of data transmitted and stored can be reduced by several thousands of times. The simulation and the experimental results demonstrate that the compressed vibration signals of rolling element bearings are effective to detect bearing faults at the total compressing ratio up to several thousand with the corresponding maximum compression ratio (CR) of CS process at nearly 100. In addition, several performance measures are applied to evaluate the reconstructed signals and show approximately the information about the noise level of the system.","","978-0-7017-0260-1","10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8082063","Rolling element bearings;compressive sensing;frequency shift;reconstruction","Signal to noise ratio;Vibrations;Rolling bearings;Fault detection;Compressed sensing;Noise measurement;Monitoring","data acquisition;fault diagnosis;machine bearings;mechanical engineering computing;rolling bearings;signal reconstruction","fault detection;rolling element bearings;bearing faults;fault diagnosis;compressive sensing;frequency shift;rotating machines;data acquisition;signal reconstruction","","","","12","","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this work is to develop an automatic wireless system for monitoring vehicle speed on the road, identify a speeding vehicle and imposing penalty for the speeding offenders. In this work, a prototype system has been developed in a laboratory environment to generate random speed data using a mechanical wheel, measure the speed data with a Shimmer wireless sensor and transfer the data wirelessly to a client computer for further analysis. Software has been developed using a Java based socket programming technique to monitor the vehicle speed in a server computer and to send the data associated with a speeding vehicle to a remotely placed client computer. The graphical user interface (GUI) can visually display the speed of a vehicle at any particular time. The functionality of the software has been tested by simulating different traffic scenarios with low and high speed limits (40 and 60 km/hr respectively). To do that a high or low speed limit can be set in the GUI. The mechanical wheel is run at different speeds and the GUI continuously displays the speed. If the vehicle speed is higher than the set speed limit for the road, the system automatically detects it and generates a report with the time of speeding, vehicle number, vehicle speed etc. to be saved in the client computer in order to take further necessary actions for the speeding offender.","","978-1-4799-2581-0","10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923841","Software development;Wireless sensor;Java socket programming;Vehicle speed monitoring","Vehicles;Monitoring;Roads;Wheels;Computers;Acceleration;Wireless sensor networks","graphical user interfaces;Java;mobile radio;road accidents;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","prototype system development;wireless vehicle speed monitoring;data association;transportation system;road accidents;automatic wireless system;vehicle speed monitoring;speeding offenders;prototype system;laboratory environment;mechanical wheel;speed data;Shimmer wireless sensor;Java based socket programming technique;server computer;remotely placed client computer;graphical user interface;GUI","","2","","21","","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Radiation-induced large-scale structure during the reionization epoch: the autocorrelation function","R. A. C. Croft; G. Altay",NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2008","388","4","1501","1520","The structures produced during the epoch of reionization by the action of radiation on neutral hydrogen are in principle different from those that arise through gravitational growth of initially small perturbations. We explore the difference between the two mechanisms using high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer. Our computations use a Monte Carlo code which ray-traces directly through smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) kernels without a grid, preserving the high spatial resolution of the underlying hydrodynamic simulation. Because the properties of the first sources of radiation are uncertain, we simulate a range of models with different source properties and recombination physics. We examine the morphology of the neutral hydrogen distribution and the reionization history in these models. We find that at fixed mean neutral fraction, structures are visually most affected by the existence of a lower limit in source luminosity, then by galaxy mass-to-light ratio, and are minimally affected by changes in the recombination rate and amplitude of mass fluctuations. We concentrate on the autocorrelation function of the neutral hydrogen, ξH I(r), as a basic quantitative measure of radiation-induced structure. All the models we test exhibit a characteristic behaviour, with ξH I becoming initially linearly antibiased with respect to the matter correlation function, reaching a minimum bias factor b∼ 0.5 when the universe is ∼10–20 per cent ionized. After this ξH I increases rapidly in amplitude, overtaking the matter correlation function. It keeps a power-law shape, but flattens considerably, reaching an asymptotic logarithmic slope of γH I≃−0.5. The growth rate of H I fluctuations is exponentially more rapid than gravitational growth over a brief interval of redshift Δz∼ 2–3.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13513.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8220658","cosmology: observations;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The joint evolution of baryons and dark matter haloes","S. Pedrosa; P. B. Tissera; C. Scannapieco",NA; NA; NA,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2010","402","2","776","788","We have studied the dark matter (DM) distribution in an ≈1012 h−1 M⊙ mass halo extracted from a simulation consistent with the concordance cosmology, where the physics regulating the transformation of gas into stars was allowed to change producing galaxies with different morphologies. The presence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to its corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not only depend on the number of baryons gathered in the central region, but also depend on the way they have been assembled. DM and baryons affect each other in a complex way, so the formation history of a galaxy plays an important role in its final total mass distribution. Supernova (SN) feedback regulates the star formation and triggers galactic outflows not only in the central galaxy but also in its satellites. Our results suggest that, as the effects of SN feedback get stronger, satellites get less massive and can even be more easily disrupted by dynamical friction, transferring less angular momentum. We found indications that this angular momentum could be acquired not only by the outer part of the DM halo, but also by the inner ones and by the stellar component in the central galaxy. The latter effect produces stellar migration which contributes to changing the inner potential well, probably working against further DM contraction. As a consequence of the action of these processes, when the halo hosts a galaxy with an important disc structure formed by smooth gas accretion, it is more concentrated than when it hosts a spheroidal system which experienced more massive mergers and interactions. We also found that in the latter case, the halo has less radial velocity anisotropy than when the halo hosts a disc galaxy. In most of our runs with baryons, we do not detect the inversion of the velocity dispersion characteristic of the dissipationless haloes. We have found that rotation velocities for the systems that were able to develop a disc structure are in good agreement with the observations, and none of them has been formed satisfying the adiabatic contraction hypothesis.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15951.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231721","galaxies: haloes;galaxies: structure;dark matter","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One proposed gait design strategy is to simulate a closed-loop hybrid model of the robot under the action of the mechanics-based controller to produce an implicit periodic orbit for each set of controller parameters. The second design strategy modifies traditional usage of nonlinear optimization to produce parameterized outputs corresponding to a stable Hybrid Zero Dynamics. The novel approach is to reformulate the HZD stability constraint using the mechanics of the system and to propose an alternative to the periodic HZD orbit existence constraint through the use of an angular momentum variant of the Linear Inverted Pendulum.

In this paper, the positive and negative sequence current expressions were deduced based on the dual current control strategy and the influence factors were analyzed based on the expressions. When the amplitude of the fault current is higher than the maximum value of the converter can transfer, a new fault current calculation method was proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation on PSCAD verified that the d-axis components of positive and negative sequence current meet second order response and the q-axis components are zero. The steady-state value of positive and negative sequence current is determined by the unbalance degree of grid and the transient process of fault current is determined by the control parameters of the grid-side converter.

In this article, a novel distributed secondary control strategy for hybrid ac/dc-microgrids is presented which coordinates the control actions of the ac and dc sides. The proposed control scheme simultaneously regulates ac-voltage magnitude and frequency, as well as the dc-voltage magnitude, by including the interlinking converters in the control strategy via a distributed consensus approach. This improves the power-sharing accuracy and secondary control restoration of the variables in both ac and dc sides of the microgrid.

As an example, a machine chain consisting of a Bucket Wheel Excavator, a Belt Wagon and a Hopper Car was used. This system has two material transfer points that need to remain aligned during operation in order to allow continuous material flow. To keep the alignment, the controller makes use of seven degrees of freedom given by slewing, luffing and crawler drives. Experimental tests were done in a simulated environment with two state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The trained agents were evaluated in terms of episode return and length, as well as alignment quality and action values used.

In order to address the bottleneck of human workload capacity, highly automated safety-critical systems are under development to support air traffic controllers. However, the transfer of tasks and capabilities from a human agent to an automated agent is not without its pitfalls. Human controllers provide safe, efficient, and creative problem-solving in conflict situations-situations that often are outside the abilities of an automated system. In order for controllers to best use their creative problem-solving skills in safety-critical situations, automated agents must shoulder `routine' activities contributing to controller workload in the current-day system, such as housekeeping tasks and basic separation assurance activities. The detection and resolution of conflicts required for basic separation assurance is the primary contributor to current day workload, since it requires controllers have an awareness of all aircraft to produce effective solutions. However in high-traffic airspace (e.g., 30+ aircraft in a sector), full situation awareness becomes impossible without automated assistance. While research on the automation of conflict detection and resolution is fairly well established, questions remain concerning the give and take between the responsibilities of the human controller and those of the automated agent. Discussed here is a portion of a larger human-in-the-loop experiment examining controllers' transition through four hypothetical automation stages of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). This portion, called Maximum NextGen, simulated a fully automated environment where the automation was responsible for detecting and resolving conflicts within simulation parameters in high-density airspace. The human moved to primarily a supervisory position: typically only assuming control over separation assurance tasks during conflict situations deferred by the automation. While tasks were allocated a-priori between the controller and automated agent, controllers maintained authority to inhibit the automation from interacting with particular aircraft. This analysis focuses on the circumstances surrounding controller's inhibitory actions upon the automation, postulating about their reasons for doing so based on contextual similarities, ultimately identifying preliminary trends for both further research and automation refinement.","2155-7209","978-1-4799-5001-0","10.1109/DASC.2014.6979409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979409","","Automation;Aircraft;Air traffic control;Keyboards;Problem-solving;Market research","aerospace safety;air traffic control;aircraft control;safety-critical software","aircraft control;automation refinement;next generation air transportation system;automated safety-critical system;air traffic density;National Airspace System;maximum NextGen condition;automated conflict resolutions;controller inhibition","","1","","10","","11 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous research, most of them employed model-based method which requires robot model in advance. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to obtain the precise mathematical model of robots. Moreover, the computer installed on the space robot is usually not so powerful due to the restriction of weight and volume, thus it is infeasible to computer dynamics parameters for real-time control. To facilitate the computation complexity, we present an approach based on human learning skill for tracking and catching objects. With human-teaching demonstration, the space robot is able to learn and abstract human tracking and capturing skill using an efficient neural-network learning architecture that combines flexible cascade neural networks with node-decoupled extended kalman filtering (CNN-NDEKF). The goal of skill learning is to obtain the most likely human performance from all the training examples and to transfer this skill to the space robot system by trained cascade neural network. We investigate the learning position trajectory in Cartesian space and position trajectory in Joint space respectively. Especially, learning position trajectory in joint space is useful to avoid the complex inverse kinematics of space robot and to lower the computation cost. The simulation results attest that this approach is useful and feasible in tracking trajectory planning and capturing of space robot. The proposed approach provides a feasible way to plan the tracking trajectory of space robot by learning human demonstration skill. The learning is significant in eliminating sluggish motion planning and correcting a motion command that the operator may mistakenly generate. It would be found useful in various other applications, such as human action recognition in man-machine interfaces, real-time training, and agile manufacturing.","","0-7803-9303-1","10.1109/ICIA.2005.1635083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635083","","Humans;Orbital robotics;Neural networks;Trajectory;Motion planning;Intelligent robots;Mathematical model;Computer architecture;Kalman filters;Filtering","aerospace robotics;robot kinematics;neural nets;tracking;path planning;student experiments;computational complexity","human intelligence;space object capturing;model-based method;computer dynamics parameter;real-time control;computation complexity;human learning skill;object tracking;object catching;human-teaching demonstration;neural-network learning architecture;cascade neural network;node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering;CNN-NDEKF;space robot system;Cartesian space;position trajectory;inverse kinematics;motion planning","","2","","17","","30 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also propose employing LED light dimming by modifying the light intensity based on the traffic conditions on the road. Most of the dimming systems currently deployed on the streets use computerized and remotely controlled wireless monitoring systems which suffer from complexity, high cost and a response that is dependent on the network data transfer speed. Unlike these systems, we propose, in this paper, a decentralized street LED light dimming system that is installed on each pole and whose dimming action is controlled by the dimming circuit of the pole itself. This yields faster and more reliable response. In addition, the proposed system does not need any additional infrastructure. It is scalable in the sense that it can be used in small or main streets with any number of poles, and flexible in system specifications based on the selection of the coverage distance of the designed motion detector.

Kn-band observations best trace the dominant luminous galactic mass and are minimally affected by dust. Images, unsharp-masked images, as well as major-axis and vertically summed surface brightness profiles are presented and discussed. Galaxies with a B/PS bulge tend to have a more complex morphology than galaxies with other bulge types, more often showing centred or off-centred X structures, secondary maxima along the major-axis and spiral-like structures. While probably not uniquely related to bars, those features are observed in three-dimensional N-body simulations of barred discs and may trace the main bar orbit families. The surface brightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, typically containing three or more clearly separated regions, including a shallow or flat intermediate region (Freeman Type II profiles). The breaks in the profiles offer evidence for bar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material. The profiles further suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc material, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from the vertical resonances and instabilities present in barred discs. Interestingly, the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles is often shorter than the isophotally thick part of the galaxies, itself always shorter than the flat intermediate region of the profiles. The steep inner region is also much more prominent along the major-axis than in the vertically summed profiles. Similarly to other recent work but contrary to the standard ‘bulge + disc’ model (where the bulge is both thick and steep), we thus propose that galaxies with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin concentrated disc (a disc-like bulge) contained within a partially thick bar (the B/PS bulge), itself contained within a thin outer disc. The inner disc likely formed secularly through bar-driven processes and is responsible for the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles, traditionally associated with a classic bulge, while the bar is responsible for the flat intermediate region of the surface brightness profiles and the thick complex morphological structures observed. Those components are strongly coupled dynamically and are formed mostly of the same (disc) material, shaped by the weak but relentless action of the bar resonances. Any competing formation scenario for galaxies with a B/PS bulge, which represent at least 45 per cent of the local disc galaxy population, must explain equally well and self-consistently the above morphological and photometric properties, the complex gas and stellar kinematics observed, and the correlations between them.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10471.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8176254","galaxies: bulges;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: photometry;galaxies: spiral;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) provide an opportunity to resolve congestions by controlling power flows and voltages. The focus in this paper lies on the thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) and the static var compensator (SVC) as they are already in use. In general, SVCs and TCSCs are controlled locally without any coordination. The resulting mutual influences may lead to a suboptimal control performance which may endanger the security of the system. In simulations where SVCs and TCSCs are controlled by local PI controllers with anti-windup, the interactions among the devices are demonstrated with TCSCs in parallel lines as well as in nonparallel lines, SVCs at different buses and a combination of TCSC and SVC in the same grid. It is shown how the controllers interact with each other, in the worst case ending up in an unsolvable conflict. Finally, a supervisory control based on optimal power flow is developed coordinating the actions of the FACTS devices placed in the same grid such that conflicts among devices are prevented. The objective is to ensure secure transmission of electrical power and to avoid congestions resulting in overloaded and possibly disconnected lines. In a test grid, the improvements in active power losses, in line loadings and in voltage profile are demonstrated","","0-7803-9191-8","10.1109/CIGRE.2005.1532761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532761","","Thyristors;Power capacitors;Static VAr compensators;Flexible AC transmission systems;Control systems;Load flow;Power systems;Power transmission lines;Voltage control;Security","flexible AC transmission systems;load flow control;optimal control;PI control;power transmission control;static VAr compensators;thyristor applications","FACTS devices;transmission grids;electric power consumption;overloaded lines;flexible AC transmission systems;power flow control;voltage control;thyristor controlled series compensator;static var compensator;suboptimal control performance;system security;PI controllers;supervisory control;active power losses","","13","","14","","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when localization measurements become unavailable, the position accuracy will drop and uncertainty will increase. While research and development on localization estimation seeks to reduce the severity of these outages, the question of what actions a robot should take under high localization uncertainty is still unresolved, and can vary on a platform-by-platform and mission-by-mission basis. In this paper, we exploit localization uncertainty measures to adapt system control parameters in real time. Offline, we optimize non-linear activation functions whose control parameters and relevant weights are trained and learned using Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Subsequently, in real time, we apply the optimized adaptation functions to the controller look-ahead distance and intermediate linear and angular velocity commands, which we identify as the most sensitive to localization error. Evolutionary runs are conducted in which a simulated target vehicle is tasked with following a randomly generated path while minimizing cross-track error, with time varying localization uncertainty added. These runs produce situation-dependent weights for parameters to the adaptation functions, which are transferred to the physical platform, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle. In simulation, our system was able to reduce cross-track error, which in certain cases exceeds 250 centimeters on non-adapted systems, to below 15 centimeters on average using EA-derived weights and parameters applied to our proposed adaptation system. Evaluation on the physical platform demonstrates that without the adaptation module in place, the platform is unable to successfully follow the path; with the adaptation module, the platform automatically adjusts its velocity and look-ahead distance to compensate for localization uncertainty.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341427","National Science Foundation; U.S. Air Force; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341427","autonomous vehicle;localization;path planning;uncertainty;evolutionary robotics;Robot Operating System","Location awareness;Uncertainty;Measurement uncertainty;Real-time systems;Land vehicles;Time measurement;Task analysis","","","","","","31","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards this, we formulate the link quality along with SkopEdge's current configuration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with actions as conversion format selection.

IEEE standard thermal and aging models are used for transformer loss-of-life (LOL) calculation. For a realistic study, the proposed model is applied to a Finnish residential two-transformer primary substation for case studies of load with and without DR. The load profile and flexibility of the demand are estimated by hourly metered consumption and survey data.

The steady state behaviour of converter can be explained by the topology of converter and the controller has taken an important role for maintaining the accurate transient, i.e. dynamic performance. DC-DC power supplies like boost has a dynamically shifting right- half plane (RHP) zero in the converters small signal control to output transfer function operating in continuous conduction mode. So it is difficult for the PID controller to exhibit good performance. For this reason a special kind of controller, i.e. Type III controller is introduced for obtaining better performance. The extra degree of freedom introduced in the Tri - state boost converter using a freewheeling interval. The non-appearance of RHP zero allows the control process to achieve larger bandwidth under the closed loop condition resulting fast response. Results are compared with classical boost converter using Type III controller in both analytical, simulation (Matlab/Simulink) method.

Most of the work on reinforcement learning considers that reinforcements are given by the environment, not addressing the problem of how to describe tasks as reinforcement functions. Preference elicitation addresses the problem of describing a human preference through utility functions, from which reinforcement functions are special cases. This paper proposes an approach where preference elicitation and reinforcement learning are handled in an integrated manner, providing an autonomous method of programming an agent. The agent is programmed through pairwise evaluations over observed behaviours of the agent, where the evaluations are summarised in the reinforcement function. In this paper we present an approach to solve such a problem based on evaluations over observed behaviours. We propose a new algorithm, PEOB-RS, that can be shown to converge towards an optimal policy, providing the number of trials for each behaviour tends to infinity. Experimental results from learning in a grid stochastic environment are used to obtain a reinforcement function, illustrating the effectiveness of PEOB-RS, even if requiring too many evaluations.

Therefore, to reduce distortion of the recorded signal, it is necessary to diminish the effective capacitance of the input circuit to about 1 μμf. It is also requisite to reduce the currents which pass through the biological specimen, both the input grid current (< 10-13 A) and the current charging the input capacitance (< 10-9 A). The performance of a cathode follower and a negative capacitance as to reduction of input capacitance was measured by the damping factor a and the time constant T' of the second-order transfer function. An equivalent input time constant Teq = aT' of 10 μsec ensures small distortion and negligible current through the cell. Whether a cathode follower or a negative capacitance is the more suitable depends on the value of that part of the input-ground capacitance Cg, which cannot be removed by screening. When Cg is large (microelectrode deeply immersed in the specimen) a negative capacitance is advantageous; with a small value of Cg (electrode immersed < 1 mm) the cathode follower may neutralize to a Teq = 30 μsec as does a negative capacitance with a cutoff frequency of 200 kc.","2162-6634","","10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4066945","","Cathodes;Impedance;Circuits;Electrodes;Biomembranes;Signal generators;Distortion measurement;Capacitance measurement;Current measurement;Time measurement","","","","26","2","20","","22 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many control applications require hard real-time channels, where the delay and jitter are in the levels of milliseconds or less. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks, e.g., delay and data injection attacks. In this article, we propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. Using a watermark key, a transmitter applies watermark noise to hard real-time signals and sends through the unencrypted hard real-time channel. The same key is transferred to the receiver by the encrypted nonreal-time channel. With the same key, the receiver can detect if the data have been modified by the attackers and take action to prevent catastrophic damages. We provide analysis and methods to design proper watermark keys to ensure reliable attack detection. We use a ship propulsion control system for the simulation-based case study, where our algorithm smoothly shuts down the system after attacks. We also evaluated the algorithm speed on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). This hardware experiment demonstrated that the RWM algorithm takes about 2.8 μs to add or validate the watermark noise on one sample data point. As a comparison, common cryptic hashing algorithms can hardly process a small data set under 100 ms. The proposed RWM is about 32 to 1375 times faster than the standard approaches.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2019.2963257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8984338","Cyber resilience;cyber security;delay attack;industrial control system (ICSs);Internet of Things (IoT);watermark","Real-time systems;Delays;Watermarking;Jitter;Integrated circuits;Data integrity;Control systems","control engineering computing;control system security;cryptography;field buses;industrial control;programmable controllers;watermarking","reliable attack detection;ship propulsion control system;Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller;RWM algorithm;watermark noise;common cryptic hashing algorithms;recursive watermark method;industrial control systems;ship automation;energy automation systems;control applications;encryption algorithm;industrial fieldbuses;watermark key;nonreal-time channel;realtime control system data integrity validation;recursive watermark algorithm;cyber-resilience enhancement;time 2.8 mus;time 100.0 ms","","1","","45","IEEE","5 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is currently a lack of understanding in microwave remote sensing in the context of oil palm and studies need to be done to translate microwave satellite imagery to meaningful information for plantation owners. There are previous studies done to classify microwave satellite imagery with the use of machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN).

We first studied the oil palm biophysical parameters together with the use of theoretical model based on radiative transfer (RT) equation where we were able to identify the key parameters and components that are sensitive to L band microwave imagery obtained from ALOS-PALSAR 2. With this knowledge in hand and feedback from agronomists, we then design 5 classification classes that can suitably portray oil palm growth status with respect under L band microwave imagery. We then proceed to classify the image with ground truth data obtained from the field study. With inspiration from techniques such as generative adaptive network (GAN), we generated simulation data with the use of RT model in order to supplement additional data to the CNN and combine this with SVM to establish the hybrid classification model. By getting the best of both techniques, the hybrid classification model managed to achieve 90% training accuracy. The classified images are then overlaid with Google Earth interface and we qualitatively evaluate the classification results with ground study information and census data. We found that the image of the hybrid classification model was in good agreement with ground truth data.","","978-1-7281-5304-9","10.1109/PIERS-Fall48861.2019.9021396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9021396","","Microwave imaging;Microwave photonics;Vegetable oils;Support vector machines;Machine learning","geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing by radar;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar;vegetable oils;vegetation mapping","oil palm growth status;L band microwave satellite imagery;vegetable oil;palm oil;vegetable oils;plantation yield;microwave remote sensing;oil palm biophysical parameters;hybrid classification model;ground study information","","","","14","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dynamics of the power system changes if the transformers are out of service for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance work under contingency situations. Faults, overloading, and mechanical abnormalities causes the incipient and critical damages to the transformer. The isolation of transformers leads to the voltage profile change, load curtailments, high compensation, economic loss, and many more problems. It is very important to know the problems occurred in the transformer parts to repair and restore it into the system to attain better stability, reliability, and economics. The transformer health monitoring system consisting of prediction, identification, and diagnostics in online as well as offline mode that will provide sufficient content to the managerial utility to take actions against the problem anticipated or occurred. The heuristic survey inks, the probability of damage in the transformer winding is more compared to the other parts. A novel method using system identification is proposed for the diagnosis of transformer winding. The location and extent of mechanical deformations can be ascertained along with specifically detecting radial and axial deformations in the transformer windings. A system identification approach in frequency and time domain were employed in the diagnostic algorithms for the sweep frequency response dataset. For both transfer function and state space model, a reference table called deformation information tableau has been synthesized for lumped parameter transformer model by varying series and shunt circuit elements systematically. The details of deformation are extracted from the tableau for actual frequency response data for a specified frequency range and winding type. The crosscorrelation of two-dimensional frequency response arrays, one being a signature array and other being deformation array, is used to represent relativity as a singleton. A toolbox is developed for the generation of heuristic deformation information tableau and to diagnose using the diagnostics algorithm developed. The proposed algorithms were verified and simulated for continuous disk type winding.","","978-1-5386-9319-3","10.1109/IconDSC.2019.8816967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816967","Deformation Information Tableau;Frequency Response Analysis;System Identification;Transformer Winding","Windings;Strain;Integrated circuit modeling;Power transformer insulation;Oil insulation;Mathematical model","condition monitoring;deformation;fault diagnosis;frequency response;maintenance engineering;power system economics;power system reliability;power system stability;power transformer testing;power transformers;probability;transformer windings","power system changes;transformer parts;transformer health monitoring system;transformer winding;system identification approach;diagnostic algorithms;lumped parameter transformer model;specified frequency range;winding type;heuristic deformation information tableau;diagnostics algorithm;deformation diagnostic methods;continuous disk type winding","","","","13","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fretting tests were carried out with simulated connector configuration at frequency of oscillation of 0.005 Hz, contact load 2 N and current 20 mA. The results showed that fretting adversely affects the contact resistance of copper connections, which shows a rapid increase and substantial fluctuations with fretting time. The effects of fretting were reduced significantly with N+ ion-implantation whereas In+ ion-implantation had practically no effect on the fluctuations in the contact resistance. Fretting had no effect on the contact resistance of AgCu-AgCu contacts. AES, EDX and SEM analyses revealed that considerable damage of the contact zones and substantial transfer of material occurred in the copper-AgCu connections as a result of the fretting action. Auger mapping of the wire and plate contact zones showed the presence of a substantial concentration of Si. The enrichment of these contact zones was associated with the contamination of the copper wires by the silicone-base lubricant used during drawing procedures.","","0-7803-2133-2","10.1109/HOLM.1994.636839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=636839","","Contact resistance;Scanning electron microscopy;Wires;Fluctuations;Copper alloys;Electrical resistance measurement;Energy measurement;Pollution measurement;Spectroscopy;Dispersion","ion implantation;ion implantation;electrical contacts;electrical contacts;contact resistance;contact resistance;wear;wear;Auger effect;Auger effect;scanning electron microscopy;scanning electron microscopy;X-ray chemical analysis;X-ray chemical analysis;electric connectors;electric connectors;lubrication;lubrication;copper;silver alloys;copper alloys","","","2","","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) determines the reinforcements that a given agent behaviour is fulfilling from the observation of the desired behaviour. In this paper we present a variant of IRL, which is called IRL with evaluation (IRLE) where instead of observing the desired agent behaviour, the relative evaluation between different behaviours is known by the access to an evaluator. We present also a solution for this problem under the assumption that a relative linear function that preserves the order assumed by the evaluator exists and that the evaluator evaluates policies instead of behaviours.

In order to enhance its efficiency, Silicon Carbide (SiC) semiconductors are used instead of Silicon (Si) ones. MOSFETs and diodes used in the MPIBC are exposed to high electrical and thermal stresses. A failure of these switches strongly affects performances of the system. Therefore, switch failures handling is very important to overcome several risks in early stage and to ensure continuity of service. It consists on fault detection (first step) and fault tolerant actions (second step) to restore healthy state in case of switch short-circuit and open-circuit faults.

To mitigate the current ripple, the switching frequency of the inverter should be high enough. The purpose of this article is to reduce the current ripple of the HSPMSM drive system. First, a Silicon-Carbide/Silicon(SiC/Si) hybrid inverter is designed. The designed hybrid inverter consists of two SiC-MOSFETs and six Si-IGBTs, and the circuit modals of the SiC/Si hybrid inverter are analyzed. Second, based on the SiC/Si hybrid inverter, three improved space-vector-modulation (SVM) strategies are proposed. The core principle of the proposed SVM strategies is that most of the switching actions are transferred from the Si-IGBTs to the SiC-MOSFETs. The benefit from the low switching loss of the SiC device is that the total power loss can be significantly reduced. Besides, the SiC-MOSFETs can create the zero-voltage-switch condition for the Si-IGBTs, and then the switching loss of the Si-IGBTs can be almost eliminated. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, sufficient simulations and experiments are implemented. The stator current ripple, total-harmonic-distortion, and the conversion efficiency of the inverter in the full power range are compared under the same condition based on the full-Si-IGBT inverter, the full-SiC-MOSFET inverter, and the SiC/Si hybrid inverter. The evaluated results sufficiently verify the superiority of the proposed SiC/Si hybrid inverter and the improved SVM strategies.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2020.3025230","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200695","Current ripple;high-speed motor;silicon-carbide;space-vector-modulation (SVM);zero-voltage-switch (ZVS)","Inverters;Support vector machines;Switches;Passive filters;Switching frequency;Switching loss;Stators","harmonic distortion;insulated gate bipolar transistors;invertors;machine control;motor drives;permanent magnet motors;power MOSFET;silicon compounds;stators;switching convertors","improved space-vector-modulation strategies;current ripple;switching frequency;high-speed permanent magnet motor drive system;SiC-MOSFETs;full-Si-IGBT inverter;control performance;HSPMSM drive system;silicon-carbide-silicon hybrid inverter;three improved space-vector-modulation strategy;stator current ripple;total-harmonic-distortion;improved SVM strategy;SiC","","","","32","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different aspects of resource provisioning and the resource pricing model in the cloud environment cause the scheduling problem of workflow very complex. One of the main aims of the scheduling algorithms is to satisfy the users' different quality of service requirements. Communication delay between tasks is an important affecting factor in optimal scheduling of workflows. It can also highly increase the cost of workflow scheduling if proper actions are not taken. To solve this problem, we propose a tasks duplication-based list scheduling algorithm called Communication-Critical Task Duplication (CCTD). We first define the concept of communication critical task (CCT) for a workflow. Then, by presenting a ranking-based approach, we identify communication critical tasks in a workflow as well as duplicating candidates. Task duplication in idle time slots of leased virtual machines which their children tasks are mapped to. This idea, while eliminating the cost and time of data transfer between parent-child tasks, reduces the time of execution of tasks and effectively uses leased time intervals of resources. According to the proposed scheduling algorithm, a new heuristic method has been proposed for the budget distribution. This method distribute overall budget to tasks in proportional to the workload and duplication rank of each task. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and verified using four well-known scientific workflows. The simulation results show that the CCTD algorithm, while respecting the user budget constraint, reduces the workflow overall completion time.","2643-279X","978-1-7281-5075-8","10.1109/ICCKE48569.2019.8965163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8965163","cloud computing;static workflow scheduling;task duplication;communication critical task;QoS-based scheduling","","cloud computing;optimisation;pricing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","scientific workflows;resource pricing model;cloud environment cause;scheduling problem;tasks duplication-based list scheduling algorithm;communication critical task;duplicating candidates;idle time slots;children tasks;parent-child tasks;duplication rank;cloud workflow scheduling;communication-critical task duplication","","1","","23","","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In case of accidents, human intervention causes time delay and it can result in many problems, even human life loss. In this regard, IoT offers a lot of benefits. The main purpose of IoT based disaster management system is to provide aid in an emergency system with minimum delay. Cloud computing plays a vital role in IoT. It provides storage, management, and processing of a large amount of data. As a large amount of data is processed on the cloud, the overall processing time increase due to transferring and processing delay. Here, Fog Computing comes into play as it provides processing at the edge of the network. it provides many advantages such as reduced latency, mobility, geographical distribution, real-time interactions etc. the purpose of this paper is to exploit the advantages of fog computing to develop a fog-based accident detection and emergency response system, which employs Android device sensors to detect an accident emergency, accident location and create an action plan to handle the emergency timely. We evaluated our approach with the help of iFogSim which is an open source toolkit for simulating fog technologies along with IoT and cloud. The results achieved after simulation are promising and illustrate that fog provides superior results in comparison to the cloud.","","978-1-5386-8143-5","10.1109/ICET.2018.8603557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8603557","Fog Computing;Accident Detection;Emergency Response System;iFogSim;Android Smartphone","Accidents;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Emergency services;Sensors;Time factors;Hardware","accidents;cloud computing;disasters;emergency management;Internet of Things;mobile computing;public domain software;smart phones","automated accident detection;iFogSim;open source toolkit;cloud computing;emergency system;IoT based disaster management system;human life loss;Android smartphone;fog technologies;accident location;accident emergency;Android device sensors;emergency response system;fog-based accident detection;real-time interactions;fog computing","","5","","35","","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The techniques used for these robotic vehicles in the field of sensors, sensor data processing and control offer enormous potential to improve in integrated drive assistance systems the safety aspects of future cars in the streets. The team of the University Wuerzburg was involved in Mars Rover developments for the European Space Agency ESA and transferred similar navigation and tele-operation techniques also to industrial transport rovers and to remotely controlled rovers for harsh environments (by example to support fire fighters in search and rescue operations during emergencies). Related assistance systems support the tele-operator in situation awareness to more reliably detect obstacles and dangers. The vehicle should be able to handle difficult situations autonomously, like obstacle avoidance and a return to the base, in particular when the radio link is lost. Interesting progress in sensor systems (new principles like PMD-camera, future navigation systems like Galileo, ...), in miniaturization, in man-machine interfaces (like augmented reality approaches) and sensor data processing provide here exciting perspectives for innovations. Assistance systems enable a range of scalable reactions, which initiate appropriate actions adapted to the specific situation and to the operatorpsilas skills. As specific example the assistance system of University Wuerzburg will be presented, which was the winner of the ldquourban scenariordquo competition at ELROB 2007, where in a city environment hidden markers were to be detected and identified.","","978-4-907764-30-2","10.1109/SICE.2008.4654608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654608","","","collision avoidance;mobile robots;telerobotics","robotic vehicles;sensor data processing;integrated drive assistance systems;industrial transport rovers;remotely controlled rovers;obstacle avoidance;man-machine interfaces","","1","","","","21 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Mediated perception and action in human robotic embodiment","M. Bergamasco","PERCRO, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy","19th International Symposium in Robot and Human Interactive Communication","11 Oct 2010","2010","","","1","1","Research on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence presently interprets the interaction between human and robotic subjects through a set of mediated controls who engage almost all human senses. The underlying communication requires the establishment of a set of interaction metaphors in order to allow a natural type of control. The most common of these metaphors is the kinematic copy of human gestures. During the last ten years incredible progresses in cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, physiology and neurophysiology have been achieved. The knowledge about the relationship between the “perception and sensori-motion mechanisms” and the brain has never been so advanced. One of the major outcomes is in the fact that it is possible to correlate brain neuronal activities to corresponding perception and motion, and, at the same time, it is possible to record these activities through the use of innovative devices. The combined adoption of these results does allow dissolving the physical constraints that act as a boundary during the interaction and control of robots and virtual environment entities. A new generation of brain and body (computer) interfaces (BBCI) will allow direct transfer of user intention and the realization of remote sensing. In such a way it will be possible to achieve the interactive communication with a robot without the requirement to physically perform any action. Virtual and robotic bodies can be controlled and moved even in absence of a correspondent motion of the controlling subject. The robots is moved only by thoughts while the robot perception is transferred directly to the humans through worn interfaces (Head mounted displays, skin and body stimulators,...). This lecture addresses the path from teleoperation and virtual environment interaction toward new methods to recreate the illusion of surrogating our own bodies in different entities (being robotic or virtual) and investigates how the relevant perception-action loops will be affected.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-7990-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598757","","","brain-computer interfaces;human-robot interaction;interactive systems;telerobotics","human robotic embodiment;robotics;artificial intelligence;interaction metaphors;sensori-motion mechanisms;perception mechanisms;brain neuronal activities;virtual environment;brain and body interfaces;user intention;interactive communication","","","","","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

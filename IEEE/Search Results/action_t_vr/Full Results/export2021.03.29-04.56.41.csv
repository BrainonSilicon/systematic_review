It is a kind of short-duration, low-intensity, and usually local-motion facial expression. However, owing to these characteristics of micro-expression, it is difficult to obtain micro-expression data, which is the bottleneck of applying deep learning methods to micro-expression recognition. In addition, micro-expression is still a type of expression, and it can also be encoded by the facial action coding system. Therefore, there is a certain correlation between action unit recognition and micro-expression recognition. Addressing those, we propose a novel knowledge transfer technique distills and transfers knowledge from action unit for micro-expression recognition, where knowledge from a pre-trained deep teacher neural network is distilled and transferred to a shallow student neural network. Specifically, a teacher-student correlative framework is designed with a novel objective function. And features extracted from the teacher network is used as prior knowledge to guide the student part to efficiently learning from the target micro-expression dataset. Experiments are conducted on four available published micro-expression datasets (SMIC2, CASME, CASME II and SAMM). The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2020.2986962","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064925","Micro-expression recognition;Knowledge distillation;Face action unit;Deep learning","Feature extraction;Gold;Neural networks;Face;Machine learning;Encoding;Knowledge engineering","","","","1","","","","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This process has been numerically simulated in the framework of the 2-D axisymmetric heat and mass transfer problem in the approximation of viscous incompressible liquid. At the next stage, jets form due to the loss of axial symmetry of the rim (the problem becomes essentially 3-D). The development of the Rayleigh-Plateau (RP) and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities of the rim are analyzed in terms of dispersion relations for surface waves. It is shown that maximum increments correspond to the capillary instability of the RP type. The calculated time of rim formation and that of its breakup into jets have been demonstrated to be comparable.

We develop the SPOT framework, which explores within action safety zones, learns about unsafe regions without exploring them, and prioritizes experiences that reverse earlier progress to learn with remarkable efficiency. The SPOT framework successfully completes simulated trials of a variety of tasks, improving a baseline trial success rate from 13% to 100% when stacking 4 cubes, from 13% to 99% when creating rows of 4 cubes, and from 84% to 95% when clearing toys arranged in adversarial patterns. Efficiency with respect to actions per trial typically improves by 30% or more, while training takes just 1-20 k actions, depending on the task. Furthermore, we demonstrate direct sim to real transfer. We are able to create real stacks in 100% of trials with 61% efficiency and real rows in 100% of trials with 59% efficiency by directly loading the simulation-trained model on the real robot with no additional real-world fine-tuning.

Finding ways to improve decision-making strategies to suit the complex and unfamiliar environments is a standing problem for traditional rule-based methods. This paper proposes a semi-rule-based decision-making strategy for heavy intelligent vehicles based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. Firstly, according to the car-following characteristics, the problems of high dimensions and a large amount of data in vehicle action space and state space are solved by dimension reduction and interval reduction to accelerate the training process. Subsequently, an accurate three-axle vehicle load model is established to calculate the load transfer rate value and carry out active control to increase the roll stability of heavy vehicles at high-speed corners. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is developed based on the reward function and update function to achieve adaptive cruise control objectives for heavy vehicles on different curvature roads.

In the case of the antivortex, we consider astroid-shaped dots, while in the case of the vortex, the circular dots and the astroid-shaped ones. Unlike in the soft-magnetic dots, the vortex (antivortex) textures in thin layers with sufficiently strong fourfold anisotropy consist of four closure domains independent of the dot shape. The magnetization in the domain walls (DWs) deviates from the dot plane under the action of the out-of-plane polarized electric current normal to the dot, which drives the DW propagation-a rotation of the texture around the vortex (antivortex) center. The DW velocity is dependent on the distance from the vortex (antivortex) core; thus, the DWs deform under the current creating a fourfold spiral shape. For sufficiently hard cubic magnets, we find a regime of the oscillatory dynamics of the dot [a cyclic switching between the spiral state and the closure-domain vortex (antivortex) state]. For softer magnets, we consider a spin-transfer-driven fast magnetization reversal of the vortex state mediated by the creation of the spiral state.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2017.2710308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937928","Magnetic domain wall (DW);magnetic vortex;spin-transfer oscillator","Magnetization;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Oscillators;Magnetic cores;Magnetic tunneling;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","magnetic anisotropy;magnetic domain walls;magnetic switching;magnetisation;magnetisation reversal;nanomagnetics;nanostructured materials;soft magnetic materials;spin polarised transport;vortices","softer magnets;vortex state;spin-transfer-driven dynamics;magnetic vortices;magnetization dynamics;antivortex-containing nanodot;out-of-plane polarized electric current;astroid-shaped dots;circular dots;soft-magnetic dots;oscillatory dynamics;magnetization reversal;magnetic antivortices;crystalline cubic anisotropy;domain walls","","1","","34","Traditional","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These robotic systems will need to have autonomous capabilities to take over during communication delays and unexpected environmental conditions during critical phases of the procedure. Understanding and predicting the next surgical actions (referred as “surgemes”) is essential for autonomous surgery. Most approaches for surgeme recognition cannot cope with the high variability associated with austere environments and thereby cannot “transfer” well to field robotics. We propose a methodology that uses compact image representations with kinematic features for surgeme recognition in the DESK dataset. This dataset offers samples for surgical procedures over different robotic platforms with a high variability in the setup. We performed surgeme classification in two setups: 1) No transfer, 2) Transfer from a simulated scenario to two real deployable robots. Then, the results were compared with recognition accuracies using only kinematic data with the same experimental setup. The results show that our approach improves the recognition performance over kinematic data across different domains. The proposed approach produced a transfer accuracy gain up to 20% between the simulated and the real robot, and up to 31% between the simulated robot and a different robot.

As during nuclear reaction due to fission reaction, observing and inspecting these nuclear fuel channel becomes a difficult task. Therefore, there arises need of replicating heating pattern on fuel channel in order to analyze the effects. Heating pattern observed on nuclear fuel channel follows a cosine heating profile. As per this, induction heating is the suitable technique for obtaining this pattern of fuel channel.

Here, we are interested in robots that carry passengers, such as robotic wheelchairs, where user preferences, comfort and the feeling of safety are important for autonomous navigation. Balancing these requirements is not straightforward. While robots can be trained in an LfD framework in which users drive the robot according to their preferences, performing these demonstrations can be time-consuming, expensive, and possibly dangerous. Inspired by recent efforts for generating synthetic data for training autonomous driving systems, we investigate whether it is possible to train a robot based on simulations to reduce the time requirements, cost and potential risk. A key characteristic of our approach is that the input is not images, but the locations of people and obstacles relative to the robot. We argue that this allows us to transfer the classifier from the simulator to the physical world and to previously unseen environments that do not match the appearance of the training set.

In this paper, an improved bootstrap enabling separate design of synchronization part and signaling transmission part is proposed. Zero correlation zone sequence is employed in frequency-domain (FD) for signaling transmission by cyclically shifting the sequence in FD. At the receiver, a universal signaling decoding method regardless of the synchronization part design is presented. Besides, to eliminate the performance degradation introduced by non-linear distortion of channel transfer function, signaling validation and correction operations on the previous symbol are required.

A low conductivity liquid is placed between two horizontal electrodes and subjected to strong unipolar charge injection which set the fluid in motion under the combined action of Coulomb and buoyancy forces. The motion induced by the charge injection has a vigorous character and strongly increases the electric charge transfer and heat transfer between the electrodes. The full set of governing equations including Navier-Stokes equation, the conservation equations of electric charge and energy and Poisson equation for electric potential is solved by a finite volume method. We define an electric Nusselt number (Ne) as the ratio of the effective current and the current existing without liquid motion, number which can be considered as the analog of Nusselt number (Nu) for a pure thermal problem. The case of heating and strong injection of electric charges from lower electrode is considered. The variation of the electric Nusselt number Ne with electrical parameter T for different values of the non-dimensional parameter mobility number M and Rayleigh number is then analyzed. It is shown that the mobility number M is a parameter which plays an important role in the characterization of electro-thermo-convective flows and also that the physical mechanisms of the different instability regimes can be better understood considering the electric Nusselt number Ne.","2153-3733","978-1-7281-1718-8","10.1109/ICDL.2019.8796724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796724","electrodynamics;electro-thermo-convection;dielectric liquids;charge injection;numerical analysis","","charge injection;confined flow;convection;dielectric liquids;electrohydrodynamics;finite volume methods;flow instability;flow simulation;Navier-Stokes equations;Poisson equation","electro-thermo-convective flow;dielectric liquid layer;external electric field;energy equation;Poisson equation;finite volume method;electric Nusselt number;non-dimensional parameter mobility number;electrical parameter;Rayleigh number;liquid motion;electric potential;conservation equations;Navier-Stokes equation;heat transfer;electric charge transfer;strong unipolar charge injection;horizontal electrodes;low conductivity liquid","","","","23","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The multiple input multiple output (MIMO) control model represents the real system with linear approximation by estimating the transfer functions. A linear controller based on the Integral-Proportional-Derivate (I-PD) scheme is proposed. In this control scheme, proportional and derivative actions are put into the feedback line to reduce the dynamics due to the uncertainties of the load and voltage reference. The nonlinear system dynamics is transformed to d-q axis coordinates making linear controller easy to design. The study focused on the theoretical and simulation analysis aspect by comparing uncompensated and compensated system. The simulation in MATLAB software environment shows that the compensated system has an excellent set-point signal tracking capability and robustly maintains voltage magnitude during the load parameter uncertainties. The power quality of the compensated system also fulfills the required standard according to the IEEE recommendation. Bode diagrams provide more specific control performance characteristics.

This can put the robot in danger when learning tabula rasa and can also be a time-intensive process especially in a multi-robot setting, where each robot is learning its model from scratch.

Experimental results in this study showed that the existing model doesn't fully describe the characteristic of the lateral dynamics for some typical operating conditions. An experimental model was derived by means of system identification using a well-known least square method to improve the prediction capability of the lateral dynamics. Commercial guidance system usually has the proportional and integral (PI) control structure. Sometimes it may not eliminate the effect of periodic lateral disturbances efficiently which are transferred from upstream spans because the controller relying solely on feedback generates control action only when an output measurement signal differs from a reference value. But if the disturbance is deterministic, a feedforward control structure may offer simple and effective disturbance rejection performance. In this paper, the lateral position of a web at the upstream span and the identified model of lateral dynamics for the span were used to estimate the effect of disturbance on the lateral dynamics of a moving web at the exit span of the guidance system. A feedforward controller was designed to reject the deterministic disturbance of lateral dynamics of a moving web. The disturbance rejection performance of the proposed controller was verified by computer simulation and experiments. These results showed that the proposed feedforward scheme with an improved mathematical model greatly improved control performance in overcoming the dynamic disturbance.","","0-7803-7883-0","10.1109/IAS.2003.1257524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257524","","Control systems;System identification;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Least squares methods;Pi control;Proportional control;Output feedback;Signal generators;Computer simulation","feedforward;position control;identification;industrial control","feedforward control;lateral position;moving web;system identification;lateral dynamics;Shelton's model;typical operating conditions;least square method;integral control structure;periodic lateral disturbances;feedback;control action;output measurement signal;disturbance rejection performance;upstream span;computer simulation;web transport system;tension control;speed control","","","","10","","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The additional degree of freedom introduced in the converter in the form of a freewheeling interval has been exploited through an easy control technique to achieve this elimination. The absence of the RHP zero allows the control scheme to achieve larger bandwidth under closed-loop conditions, resulting in fast response. Analytical, simulation and experimental results of the tri-state boost converter have been presented and compared with those of the classical boost converter both under open-loop and under closed-loop operating conditions.

In combat information centres (CIC) of Navy ships operational data about objects in the environment are processed in a complex command and control cycle. Due to different task domains and an increasing performance of both modern sensors and data transfer, the command and control processes are characterized by high complexity that might affect the operators' workload and consequently the error rate in the workflow. One approach to improve this situation may be the use of assistance systems. In addition, the lack of competency and skills or the absence of the qualified operators caused by demographic changes will make assistance systems indispensable in the future. In a simulation study a cognitive assistance system (COGAS) is being developed for supporting the crew, and especially the decision maker, of a CIC during air target identification. COGAS contains two supporting modules called cognitive units, which are combined to fulfill its support functions by means of flexible automation. Both cognitive units are based on Rasmussen's Decision Ladder which describes the behavior of well-trained and motivated operators controlling complex dynamic systems. This article outlines the functional structure of COGAS and its cognitive units. Both units contain a memory of a-priori knowledge, a memory of present situation knowledge, and activities for processing data. The structure of supporting cognitive units, which comprise modules of the relevant system environment and system goals, as well as possible system tasks and actions, is described in some detail. In order to simulate CIC working processes with or without COGAS, we utilized the Integrated Performance Modeling Environment (IPME). IPME provides model components which represent the activities of the system, COGAS and the operator in the form of task networks. IPME also helps to analyze human performance in highly complex systems and provides models for determining operator workload.

"On the sign of the feedback applied by power system damping controllers","L. Rouco; F. L. Pagola","Sch. of Eng., Univ. Pontificia Comillas, Madrid, Spain; NA","2001 IEEE Porto Power Tech Proceedings (Cat. No.01EX502)","6 Aug 2002","2001","2","","7 pp. vol.2","","This paper studies the sign of the feedback applied by Power System Damping Controllers (PSDCs). The sign of the feedback to be applied by power system stabilizers (PSSs) is well established from the understanding of the physical mechanisms of their damping action. However, the complexity of the damping action provided by FACTS devices does not allow to determine easily the sign of the feedback to be applied by their damping controllers. This paper discusses the sign of the feedback applied by PSDCs in the context of their design using eigenvalue sensitivities. As the eigenvalue sensitivity approach to design PSDCs focuses only on the poorly damped electromechanical modes, they can be properly damped whereas one or several unstable modes may arise if the sign of the feedback is not proper. This paper suggests a criterion to determine the sign applied by PSDCs. It is based on the analysis of the frequency response of the open loop transfer function combined with conclusions drawn from the numerical pole zero analysis of several open loop transfer functions of a small power system. The application of the criterion is illustrated in a small power system widely used for fundamental studies of power system electromechanical oscillations.","","0-7803-7139-9","10.1109/PTC.2001.964756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964756","","Feedback;Power systems;Damping;Power system analysis computing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Transfer functions;Power system control;Control systems;Frequency response;Poles and zeros","power system stability;power system control;control system synthesis;damping;circuit oscillations;feedback;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;frequency response;control system analysis","power system damping controllers;power system stabilizers;physical mechanisms;damping action;FACTS devices;feedback sign analysis;control simulation;eigenvalue sensitivity approach;control design;poorly damped electromechanical modes;frequency response;open loop transfer function;numerical pole-zero analysis;power system electromechanical oscillations","","","","13","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing models for the HMTF utilized in remote sensing are based on approximations derived from consideration of conservation of wave action. However the accuracy of these approximations has been quantified only through comparison with experimental data; in such comparisons, numerous empirical models for terms such as wind forcing and breaking wave dissipation are required that make direct evaluation of the hydrodynamic effects difficult. A method for providing direct insight into the hydrodynamic modulation of short sea waves by longer waves is described in this paper, through use of numerical non-linear hydrodynamic codes for sea surface evolution. A Monte Carlo simulation process based on a stochastic spectrum of short waves propagating over a single deterministic long wave is described, including the data analysis techniques developed to extract a numerical HMTF from the simulated surfaces. HMTF values obtained from the simulations are compared to those from a first order wave action solution, and found to be in reasonable agreement.","2153-7003","0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241484","","Hydrodynamics;Remote sensing;Surface waves;Sea surface;Transfer functions;Modulation coding;Stochastic processes;Data analysis;Data mining;Analytical models","geophysical fluid dynamics;Monte Carlo methods;ocean waves;wind","short sea waves modulation;longer sea waves;ocean currents;remote sensing;hydrodynamic modulation transfer function;HMTF;wind forcing;breaking wave dissipation;numerical nonlinear hydrodynamic codes;sea surface evolution;Monte Carlo simulation process;stochastic spectrum;data analysis techniques","","1","","11","","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the excitation reactance of induction motor, the paper analyzes how the maximum power transfer limit is affected by OLTC ratios. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that in the normal regulating range the maximum power transfer limit is of three kinds of changing trends, that is, monotone increasing, decreasing after increasing and monotone decreasing respectively.

Continuous and discrete variables of different machines are monitored to analyze performance using a virtual environment running synchronous to plant floor equipment as a reference. Data are extracted from machines using industrial Internet of Things solutions. Productivity and reliability of a physical system are compared in real time with data from a hybrid simulation. The simulation uses discrete-event systems to estimate performance metrics at a system level, and continuous dynamics at a machine level to monitor input and output variables. Simulation outputs are used as a reference to detect abnormal conditions based on deviations of real outputs in different stages of the process. This monitoring method is implemented in a fully automated manufacturing system testbed with robots and CNC machines. Machines are integrated on an Ethernet/IP control network using a programmable logic controller to coordinate actions and transfer data. Results demonstrated the capacity to perform real-time monitoring and capture performance errors within confidence intervals. Note to Practitioners-Estimating expected performance of a manufacturing system processing different parts across multiple machines is a complex problem due to the lack of closed-form equations. Existing solutions focus on monitoring stochastic variables such as production or failure rate, or machine dynamics in separate environments often running asynchronous to the real system.

The proposed framework uses a real-time hybrid simulation of manufacturing at a machine and system level. The hybrid approach is based on a discrete and continuous model of manufacturing equipment integrated to run synchronously with the real plant floor operation. Data from both the virtual and real environments are merged to assess performance.

Existing tools are based on supercomputers or customized neuromorphic architectures to compute large-scale SNN models. However, many of them are unsuitable to carry out real-time analysis of large scale SNN with minimal cost as large amount of complex data needs to be processed and displayed at the same time. This work intends to provide an efficient cost effective and power efficient emulation tool based on hardware-software hybrid to process, control, and display large-scale SNN network behavior in real time. The solution consists of a customized hardware architecture that computes the neural-synaptic parameters and a software environment that displays the same on the screen of a general purpose computer (Host). The data to be visualized is transferred to the host through high speed Ethernet link.

To do so, we investigate the spatial properties of an extracellular action potential (AP). This properties are described qualitatively and quantitatively using analytical study on an inhomogeneous an anisotropic nerve model. Then, a spectral analysis on this spatial signal discriminates the different frequency components. Low spatial frequencies represent the global shape of the signal, whereas high frequencies are related to the type of fibers. We show that the latter is rapidly attenuated with the distance and thus, being a local phenomenon, can be used as a selective measurement.

The method is based on the detection of two surface EMG signals with different spatial filters and on the compensation of the spatial filtering operations by two temporal filters (with CV as unknown parameter) applied to the signals. The transfer functions of the two spatial filters may have different magnitudes and phases, thus the detected signals have not necessarily the same shape. The two signals are first spatially and then temporally filtered and are ideally equal when the CV value selected as a parameter in the temporal filters corresponds to the velocity of propagation of the detected action potentials. This approach is the generalization of the classic spectral matching technique. A theoretical derivation of the method is provided together with its fast implementation by an iterative method based on the Newton's method. Moreover, the lowest CV estimate among those obtained by a number of filter pairs is selected to reduce the CV bias due to nonpropagating signal components. Simulation results indicate that the method described is less sensitive than the classic spectral matching approach to the presence of nonpropagating signals and that the two methods have similar standard deviation of estimation in the presence of additive, white, Gaussian noise. Finally, experimental signals have been collected from the biceps brachii muscle of ten healthy male subjects with an adhesive linear array of eight electrodes. The CV estimates depended on the electrode location with positive bias for the estimates from electrodes close to the innervation or tendon regions, as expected. The proposed method led to significantly lower bias than the spectral matching method in the experimental conditions, confirming the simulation results.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.819847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246373","","Muscles;Filtering;Electromyography;Electrodes;Spatial filters;Transfer functions;Phase detection;Signal detection;Shape;Iterative methods","muscle;electromyography;medical signal processing;spatial filters;iterative methods;Newton method;AWGN;biomedical electrodes;filtering theory","muscle fiber conduction velocity;surface EMG signals;spatial filtering;temporal filtering;surface electromyography signals;transfer functions;magnitudes;phases;CV value;detected action potentials;propagation velocity;generalization;classic spectral matching technique;iterative method;Newton method;filter pairs;CV bias;nonpropagating signal components;standard deviation of estimation;additive white Gaussian noise;biceps brachii muscle;healthy male subjects;adhesive linear electrode array;electrode location;positive bias;innervation regions;tendon regions;spectral matching method","Action Potentials;Adult;Algorithms;Elbow;Electrodes;Electromyography;Humans;Isometric Contraction;Male;Motor Neurons;Muscle Fibers;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle, Skeletal;Neural Conduction;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Skin Physiology","46","","35","","17 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, the number of controlled output values of the object is the same as the number of inputs used to control the object. There are examples of using two or more input channels to control a single output value of an object. This is justified by the fact that different control channels have evident different shortcomings, and hence different advantages. In particular, this is efficient if one of the control channels is limited in speed, and the other is limited in the control range. If there are no evident differences in the advantages of different control channels, such redundant control is not used. There are no publications on the efficiency of using redundant management of multi-channel objects. Analytical methods for calculating controllers, even with non-redundant control, are extremely complex, and for the case of second-order objects with delay, there are no adequate analytic methods. This explains the lack of publications on the redundant control of multi-channel objects, since this task is extremely difficult for analytical methods. The emergence of software tools for mathematical modeling (simulation) and numerical optimization removed the problem of calculating of complex regulators for complex sophisticated. The use of such software makes allows investigating the usefulness of excessive control on numerical examples. This paper is devoted to the investigation of the expediency of controlling a second-order object of dimenslon 3×2 with a delay. It is shown that even if there are no visible bases for using all three control channels, this gives a significant positive effect.

In our model, this process has been divided into two stages. At the initial one, the melt is extruded from the microcrater on the cathode surface under the action of plasma pressure. As a result, a liquid-metal toroidal rim is formed around the crater. This process has been numerically simulated in the framework of the two-dimensional axisymmetric heat and mass transfer problem in the approximation of viscous incompressible liquid. At the next stage, the geometry of the problem loses axial symmetry due to azimuthal instabilities development (the liquid metal rim breaks into jets). The development of the instabilities of the rim is analyzed in terms of dispersion relations for surface waves. It is shown that maximum increments correspond to the capillary instability of the Plateau-Rayleigh type. The time of formation of liquid metal jets and their probable number are estimated.","2471-786X","978-1-5386-4375-4","10.1109/DEIV.2018.8537148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537148","","Cathodes;Metals;Liquids;Vacuum arcs;Arc discharges;Numerical simulation;Surface discharges","cathodes;drops;flow simulation;liquid metals;mass transfer;numerical analysis;plasma jets;plasma pressure;vacuum arcs","liquid-metal toroidal rim;cathode surface;cathode spot cell sizes;molten metal jets formation;vacuum arc discharge;molten metal jet formation;liquid metal jets;liquid metal rim;viscous incompressible liquid;mass transfer problem;two-dimensional axisymmetric heat","","","","25","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation results allow one to clearly identify the different phases of life of an individual spot: the ignition, the expansion over the cathode surface, and the thermal explosion. The expansion phase is associated with a nearly constant maximum temperature of the cathode, which occurs at the surface and is approximately 4700-4800 K. Thermal explosion is a result of thermal instability (runaway), which develops below the cathode surface when the Joule heating comes into play. The development of the spot is interrupted if the plasma cloud has been extinguished: the spot is destroyed by heat removal into the bulk of the cathode due to thermal conduction. Therefore, different scenarios are possible depending on the time of action of the cloud: the spot may be quenched before having been formed or during the expansion phase, or even at the initial stage of thermal explosion.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2017.2697005","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia of Portugal; Siemens AG; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930510","Arc discharges;electrodes;vacuum arcs","Cathodes;Vacuum arcs;Clouds;Numerical models;Plasma temperature;Heating systems","cathodes;explosions;heat conduction;ignition;numerical analysis;plasma chemistry;plasma heating;plasma instability;plasma simulation;plasma sources;plasma transport processes;surface discharges;vacuum arcs","numerical simulation;cathode spot model;high-current vacuum arcs;plasma cloud;current transfer mechanisms;cathode surface;metal vapor ionization;Joule heat generation;ignition;thermal explosion;thermal instability;thermal conduction","","9","","41","","17 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown by way of examples that skin irradiation by red light, where the porphyrins have local maxima of light absorption, can improve the generation of SO as compared with the irradiation at a wavelength corresponding to the absolute maximum of light absorption. We obtained that the said improvement of SO generation can be about 5 to 10 times at specific depths inside tissue and 2 to 12 times integrally for the whole dermis thickness.

To combat this, a new data-transition adaptive DFE termed data-transition DFE is proposed. We show that data-transition DFE does not reduce vertical eye-opening whereas data-state DFE shrinks vertical eye-opening when consecutive 1s or 0s are present. We further show for the high-frequency components of data, datatransition DFE is capable of increasing vertical eye-opening. Although data-state DFE is also capable of increasing vertical eye-opening for the high-frequency components of data, this is at the expense of sacrificing vertical eye-opening for the low-frequency components of data. The stronger the DFE action, the severer the reduction of the vertical eye-opening of the low-frequency components of data. The optimal tap of data-state DFE occurs when the vertical eye-opening of the low-frequency components of data is the same as that of the high-frequency components of data. Moreover, we show that data-transition DFE not only offers a unity signal transfer function at low frequencies where most of the energy of data is located but also provides first-order shaping on the difference between the desired and equalized data. Both give rise large vertical eye-opening. The theoretical findings are validated using the simulation results of two serial links, one with data-state DFE with loop-unrolling and the other with the data-transition DFE designed in TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology.","1558-3899","978-1-5090-6389-5","10.1109/MWSCAS.2017.8053246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053246","Serial links;decision feedback equalizer (DFE);data-state DFE;data-transition DFE","Decision feedback equalizers;Transfer functions;Frequency-domain analysis;Time-domain analysis;CMOS technology;Bit error rate;Backplanes","CMOS integrated circuits;decision feedback equalisers;transfer functions","data-state DFE;vertical eye-opening;high-frequency components;datatransition DFE;low-frequency components;data-transition DFE;adaptive data-transition decision feedback equalizer;data-state decision feedback equalizers;data-transition adaptive DFE;time 1.0 s;time 0.0 s;size 65.0 nm","","","","3","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The critical problem of human activity unified learning (HAUL) was not well studied in previous work. One important challenge is the lack of a representation that can be learned from both levels. We introduce a novel approach to address this HAUL problem at the representation level, by simultaneously learning action labels and motion trajectories from publicly available 3D human skeletal datasets, thus avoiding additional human labor for data collection. Our approach builds a subject and body position independent shared skeleton, and extracts features of skeletal activities based on this model. Then the extracted features are encoded by the parameter set of Gaussian Mixture Models to construct the unified representations. The proposed compact representation can be directly applied to identify activity labels when combined with Support Vector Machines, and can be also employed to generate trajectories of the learned activities when combined with Gaussian Mixture Regression on a robot. Finally, an inverse kinematic mapping is developed to transfer human skeletal trajectories to joint angle sequences in the robot's embodiment. Empirical studies using simulation and real humanoid robots demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance on robot unified learning of human action labels and motion trajectories, effectively addressing the HAUL problem.","1944-9437","978-1-5090-3929-6","10.1109/ROMAN.2016.7745095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745095","","Trajectory;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Skeleton;Robot sensing systems","Gaussian processes;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;motion control;regression analysis;support vector machines;trajectory control","unified robot learning;action labels;motion trajectories;3D human skeletal data;human activity unified learning;HAUL;human activity recognition;low level motion trajectory reproduction;robot imitation learning;data collection;Gaussian mixture models;support vector machines;Gaussian mixture regression;robot embodiment;humanoid robots","","3","","29","","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our model, each unit corresponds to a large number of neurons and may be roughly seen as abstracting the functional behavior exhibited by a single voxel under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the course of the dynamics, the units exchange portions of formal charge, which correspond to waves of activity in the underlying microscale neuronal circuit. The geometric model abstracts away the neuronal complexity and is mathematically tractable, which allows us to establish explicit results on its ground states and the resulting charge transfer graph modeling functional graph of the network. We show that, for a wide choice of parameters and geometrical setups, our model yields a scale-free functional connectivity with the exponent approaching 2, which is in agreement with previous empirical studies based on fMRI. The level of universality of the presented theory allows us to claim that the model does shed light on mesoscale functional self-organization phenomena of the nervous system, even without resorting to closer details of brain connectivity geometry which often remain unknown.

The task of model identification and validation becomes important in this context. The validity of the models has a direct influence on operator's decisions and actions. In other words, erroneous or imprecise models lead to erroneous predictions of the systems' behavior which may result in unwanted operator's actions. This paper addresses the challenge of model structure choice for modeling and parameter identification in power systems. Three types of model structures are analyzed: 1) physical principle-based modeling; 2) black-box modeling (NARX, transfer function, Hammerstein-Wiener model); and 3) combination of physical and black-box modeling. This analysis has been performed using real grid measurements and available knowledge about a static VAR compensator (SVC) connected to the U.K.'s transmission network and operated by National Grid. The SVC's modeling is presented in the context of a generalized modeling and identification algorithm, that is offered as a guideline for engineers.

The evaluation of algorithms developed for communication and co-operation in this context is usually accomplished separately. On the one hand, network simulation helps to measure the efficiency of routing or medium access. On the other hand, robot simulators are used to evaluate the physical movements. Using two different simulators might introduce inconsistent results, and might make the transfer on real hardware harder. With the development of methods and techniques for co-operation in Sensor/Actuator Networks (SANETs), the need for integrated evaluation increased. To compensate this demand, we developed BARAKA. This tool provides integrated simulation of communication networks and robotic aspects. Thus, it allows the complete modelling of co-operation issues in SANETs including the performance evaluation of either robot actions or networking aspects while considering mutual impact.","","1-4244-0613-7","10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268067","","Robot sensing systems;Wireless sensor networks;Hardware;Computational modeling;Actuators;Communication networks;Routing;Computer science;Computer simulation;Context","actuators;mobile robots;wireless sensor networks","BARAKA;SANET;mobile robot simulator;physical movement;actuator network;wireless sensor network","","3","","11","","9 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular Q-learning to learn the shortest path on the building model's graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the Q-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actor-critic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces. Hence, our model achieves near optimal performance on the real world emergency environment.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2020.2967936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8989970","Deep Q-networks;double DQN (DDQN);DQN;dueling DQN;emergency management;evacuation;fire evacuation environment;pretraining;reinforcement learning (RL);transfer learning","Buildings;Uncertainty;Task analysis;Planning;Games;Decision making;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The system proposed permits to obtain a nanosecond high power radiation pulse using a long pulse current with rise time of /spl sim/ 1 ms for HEDP and ICF research. The main idea of this system is to drive away a current through the outer shell and after that fast transfer the current onto Z-pinch load (liner) with low density plasma of the outer shell due to its geometrical expansion into it hole in the cathode and falling on the inner liner. Computational simulations with detailed dynamics of the low density turbulent plasma were performed using the 2-D RMHD code ZETA. The modeling of the implosion of the tungsten double shell under action of 5MA current pulse with 15s rise time was performed. The geometry with the hollow cathode is tested and compared with conventional planar electrode geometry simulation results. Due to long time of implosion and Rayleigh-Taylor instability development a half height radiation pulse duration is of 70ns with radiation power value of 0.3TW for planar electrodes. But for the hollow cathode geometry a radiation pulse rise time is much less and equals 10ns. The radiation power increases up to 1.2TW. Obtained results shows a possibility to sharpen the radiation power of the pinch with hollow cathode and to get nanosecond X-radiation pulses in a long implosion system.","","0-7803-7141-0","10.1109/PPPS.2001.960808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960808","","Pulse generation;Cathodes;Plasma simulation;Geometry;Plasma density;Electrodes;Computational modeling;Tungsten;Testing;Solid modeling","glow discharges;pulse generators;fusion reactor ignition;Z pinch;Rayleigh-Taylor instability;plasma simulation","nanosecond X-radiation pulse generation;long implosion systems;hollow cathode;outer shell;Z-pinch load;low density plasma;inner liner;computational simulations;low density turbulent plasma;ZETA 2-D RMHD code;implosion modelling;tungsten double shell;current pulse;current rise time;implosion time;Rayleigh-Taylor instability development;half height radiation pulse duration;radiation power;radiation pulse rise time;5 MA;15 s;70 ns;10 ns;0.3 TW;1.2 TW","","","","","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And it is difficult to obtain the right of way for new transmission lines. Therefore the existing lines must be better used, e.g. by increasing the operating voltage. Since the isolation voltage must not be exceeded in any case, the oscillations due to switching actions at the ends of the line must be reduced, by active damping. Based on the measurement of the voltage, an additional current is injected at the same location. This current is to be generated by a FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System). An appropriate controller is designed using the H∞ optimization method, where the closed loop transfer functions are tuned, and the tuning weights follow directly from the specifications. However such a controller will invert the plant. For plants with resonances and antiresonances, as considered here, the resulting closed loop behavior is not acceptable. The method proposed here avoids this inversion. It can also be used to design robust controllers. The H∞ approach is based on a plant model. Since the electric power transmission line is described by a partial differential equation, the model must be approximated by a set of ordinary differential equations before common engineering tools may be applied. This is done by using the Euler-Lagrange equation and the eigenfunctions of the line. Significantly better results are obtained than with the well known π-model. The active damping of the line, that is the performance of the controller, is demonstrated by simulations.","","978-3-9524173-6-2","10.23919/ECC.2001.7076272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7076272","Power Systems;Electric Power Transmission Lines;Infinite dimensional systems;H-Infinity control;Active Damping","Sensitivity;Transfer functions;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Mathematical model;Approximation methods;Damping;Voltage control","control system synthesis;flexible AC transmission systems;H∞ control;partial differential equations;power markets;power transmission control;power transmission lines;transfer functions","electric power transmission lines;deregulated energy market;isolation voltage;switching actions;active damping;flexible AC transmission system;FACTS;H∞ optimization method;closed loop transfer functions;tuning weights;robust controller design;plant model;partial differential equation;ordinary differential equations;Euler-Lagrange equation;eigenfunctions;π-model;active line damping;antiresonances","","","","21","","27 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the production of ultra-thin strips is outside the conventional design scope of the traditional hot rolling process. One evident problem is that the thermal model implemented in traditional finishing mills supplies neither an accurate prediction of head-end temperature nor initiates correct action for strip's in-bar temperature control. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the heat transfer behavior for the hot-rolled strip in finishing stands was first investigated, and a simulation system was then developed as an off-line utility to evaluate the performance of the existing thermal model.

The integral equations and discretizations were formulated in terms of the single- and double-layer operators. All inner element integrals were calculated analytically. The computational methods were validated against analytical solutions in a simplified geometry. On the basis of the validation, no method was optimal in all testing scenarios. In the forward computation of the epicardial potential, the linear Galerkin (LG) method produced the smallest errors. The LG method also produced the smallest discretization error on the epicardial surface. In the inverse computation of epicardial potential, the electrode-specific transfer matrix performed better than the full transfer matrix. The Tikhonov 2 regularization outperformed the Tikhonov 0.

The breaker status is responsible for the switching between the two control modes and the breaker status is decided by the proposed algorithm. The seamless transfer algorithm observes the PCC voltage on the grid side and the frequency of the grid and decides an action based on the whether the two parameters are within a particular limit.

An optimum inverse transfer coefficient matrix, relating intracavitary potentials to endocardial potentials, is computed and subsequently used to calculate the best linear estimate of the true endocardial potentials.

In this paper, a self tuning PID control method using reinforcement learning is proposed the pitch control of large wind turbine generator (LWTG). Actor-Critic learning is used to tune PID parameters in an adaptive way by taking advantage of the model-free and on-line learning properties of reinforcement learning effectively.

Such authentic problems have enormous potential for learning as they are real and will probably arise in the controller's real work. Resolving authentic problems on a simulator encourages transfer by demonstrating when the knowledge is useful and by showing the effect of the learner's actions. However this process is difficult, since authentic problems tend to require a wide range of knowledge which often lead the learner in activities beyond their abilities. Some support is required for learning from simulation to occur. Sometimes this support is provided by human tutors (in ATC training for example this support is provided by a human instructor sitting at the back of the controller during the running of an exercise on the simulator), this support could also be given by a computer learning environment. This paper presents an intelligent simulator-based learning environment for air traffic controllers which provides a protected and guided environment to the learner. One central element of this environment is the ability to evaluate the learner's skills.

In such situation, it is one of the highest priority for the autonomous mobile robot to reach the destination point without failure. Therefore, we consider the transfer of the mobile robot on pre-planned paths to a partially observed environment. When the mobile robot encounters danger in the observing environment and determines to take a detour, it is necessary to re-plan safe routes in a short time. In this study, we focused on the rollover risk of mobile robot. And we simulate the autonomous rerouting of the mobile robot for finding a more secure route such that it can safely arrive at the destination point, whenever it senses high possibility of rollover. By using fuzzy inference to judge rollover risk, the mobile robot judges the necessity of route change according to the magnitude of risk. We also aimed to quickly perform rerouting by using the D* Lite algorithm in real-time for robot movement. We propose a method to realize route planning modification based on evaluation and judgment of rollover risk by combining fuzzy inference and D* Lite algorithm. As a result, we confirm that the autonomous mobile robot can reach the destination point by real-time evaluation of the risk and taking detour action as necessary. Experiments are conducted through computer simulation using a virtual mobile robot and a 3D path based on graph theory.

Two kinds of errors/noise: geometric errors and measurement errors exist in the ECG inverse problem and make the solution of such problem more difficulty. In particular, geometric errors will directly affect the calculation of transfer matrix A in the linear system equation AX = B. In this paper, we have applied the truncated total least squares (TTLS) method to reconstruct EPs from BSPs. This method accounts for the noise/errors on both sides of the system equation and treats geometric errors in a new fashion. The algorithm is tested using a realistically shaped heart-lung-torso model with inhomogeneous conductivities. The h-adaptive boundary element method [h-BEM, a BEM mesh adaptation scheme which starts from preset meshes and then refines (adds/removes) grid with fixed order of interpolation function and prescribed numerical accuracy] is used for the forward modeling and the TTLS is applied for inverse solutions and its performance is also compared with conventional regularization approaches such as Tikhonov and truncated single value decomposition (TSVD) with zeroth-, first-, and second-order. The simulation results demonstrate that TTLS can obtain similar results in the situation of measurement noise only but performs better than Tikhonov and TSVD methods where geometric errors are involved, and that the zeroth-order regularization is the optimal choice for the ECG inverse problem. This investigation suggests that TTLS is able to robustly reconstruct EPs from BSPs and is a promising alternative method for the solution of ECG inverse problems.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.912404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384223","ECG inverse problem;truncated total least squares (TTLS) method;h-adaptive BEM;Tikhonov;truncated single value decomposition (TSVD);h-adaptive BEM;inverse problem;Tikhonov;TTLS method;TSVD","Least squares methods;Electrocardiography;Inverse problems;Equations;Surface reconstruction;Measurement errors;Linear systems;Noise shaping;Testing;Conductivity","boundary-elements methods;electrical conductivity;electrocardiography;inverse problems;least squares approximations;physiological models","truncated total least squares method;regularization method;ECG inverse problems;epicardial potentials;body surface potentials;geometric errors;measurement errors;transfer matrix;linear system equation;realistically shaped heart-lung-torso model;inhomogeneous conductivity;h-adaptive boundary element method;forward modeling","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Body Surface Potential Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electrocardiography;Heart Conduction System;Humans;Least-Squares Analysis;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical","38","","50","","14 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such research yields important information on individual membrane ionic currents and their relation to the single cell action potential. However, it is often difficult to predict how (changes in) individual currents affect cell-to-cell transfer of the cardiac action potential. Therefore, Joyner and coworkers introduced the ""coupling clamp"" technique in which an isolated cardiac cell can be electrically coupled to either another isolated cardiac cell or to an analog model cell that mimics cardiac cell properties (RC circuit). Building on this concept, we developed the PC-controlled ""model clamp"" technique, in which an isolated cardiac cell is dynamically coupled to a comprehensive model cell that is being computed in real time. With this system we have the ability to vary the intercellular coupling conductance as well as the intrinsic cellular properties of the model cell.

This study develops a methodology to attain optimally real-time control actions to minimize the bunching phenomenon. To this end, a “library” of selected operational tactics is constructed, for the PT operators, not only to assist in reducing vehicle bunching but also to increase the likelihood of direct (without await) transfers. The library of operational tactics serves as a basis for a process of real-time control actions to maintain the scheduled headway and thus achieving maximal transfer synchronization. The methodology developed, using simulation, is applied to a case study of actual bus routes operated in the region of Auckland, New Zealand. The results imply what tactic to use in real time, what is the optimal control strength, and what is the saving of riding and waiting times in comparison with PT operation without using tactics.

In order to clarify the temperature field distribution of aircraft jet flow acting on the pavement surface, this paper obtained the temperature field distribution of pavement surface under the action of three types of aircraft jet flow by combining field test experiment and CFD simulation. CFD simulation adopts the shear stress transfer model which is often used in engineering problem calculation, and the field test experiment adopts the method of embedding temperature sensor in precast concrete slab. The paired two sample t test was used to test the difference between the experimental results and the simulation results. The experimental results show that the pavement temperature increases first and then decreases with the distance from the engine, and reaches the maximum at the intersection point of the jet flow and the airport pavement. The simulation curve is in good agreement with the experimental results. When the level of confidence is 0.01, there is no significant difference between the simulation value and the experimental value, which verifies the accuracy and feasibility of the simulation calculation model. The simulation results of the three aircraft showed that when type C aircraft is in the state of full afterforce, the maximum pavement temperature is the highest which is 22m away from the nozzle, and can reach 533.81K.

Specifically, our framework extends recently proposed propagation networks (PropNets) and consists of two complementary components, a physics predictor and a belief regulator. While the former predicts the future states of the object(s) manipulated by the robot, the latter constantly corrects the robot's knowledge regarding the objects and their relations. Our results showed that after training in a simulator, the robot can reliably predict the consequences of its actions in object trajectory level and exploit its own interaction experience to correct its belief about the state of the environment, enabling better predictions in partially observable environments. Furthermore, the trained model was transferred to the real world and verified in predicting trajectories of pushed interacting objects whose joint relations were initially unknown. We compared BRDPN against PropNets, and showed that BRDPN performs consistently well. Moreover, BRDPN can adapt its physic predictions, since the relations can be predicted online.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196878","","Robots;Physics;Engines;Predictive models;History;Neural networks;Trajectory","backpropagation;graph theory;neural nets;robot programming","groups of articulated objects;learning action effects;complex robotic systems;graph neural networks;Belief Regulated Dual Propagation nets;object interaction;object trajectory level;belief regulator;physics predictor;PropNets;general-purpose learnable physics engine;BRDPN;robotics domain","","","","22","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two widely discussed problems within this field are the temporal credit assignment problem and the transfer of experience. The temporal credit assignment problem postulates that deciding whether an action is good or bad may not be done upon right away because of delayed rewards. The problem of transferring experience investigates the question of how experience can be generalized and transferred from a familiar context, where it was acquired, to an unfamiliar context, where it may, nevertheless, prove helpful. We propose a controller for modelling such flexibility in a context-dependent reinforcement learning paradigm. The devised controller combines two alternatives of perfect learner algorithms. In the first alternative, rewards are predicted by individual objects presented in a temporal sequence. In the second alternative, rewards are predicted on the basis of successive pairs of objects. Simulations run on both deterministic and random temporal sequences show that only in case of deterministic sequences, a previously acquired context could be retrieved. This suggests a role of temporal sequence information in the generalization and transfer of experience.","","978-1-4799-7633-1","10.1109/HIS.2014.7086184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086184","reinforcement learning;temporal context;computational models;context-dependent learning;temporal credit assignment problem;transfer of experience","Context;Context modeling;Hybrid intelligent systems;Prediction algorithms;Random sequences;Observers;Learning (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence);statistics","temporal statistics;context-dependent reinforcement learning;RL;temporal credit assignment problem;experience transfer problem;temporal sequence information","","4","","12","","16 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, PCK technology is conducted a detailed analysis, and its model is established by artificial neural network. New controller has been designed to control the model by choosing the appropriate control variables. Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP) is the advanced form of Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm. Typical DHP structure is consists of three modules: Critic Network, Action Network, and model network. Its Critic network output cost function J's partial derivative to the state variable and therefore have a higher accuracy, with the corresponding its calculation is much more complex. Its purpose is when minimizing the cost-to-go function, one can find the optimal or sub-optimal control signal, so that the discrete-time nonlinear systems to obtain the desired control trajectory.

Inclusion of dynamic ratings of circuits and a simulation capability over any time length are the other two features of the presented method. The probabilistic operation risk evaluation method is an enhancement to and should be combined with traditional system analysis techniques. The proposed method has been applied to BC Hydro's metro system.

For a better understanding, the temperature propagation was assumed only in a 1-D horizontal direction. The problem geometrization is defined in function of rectangular approximation meshing. After the determination of the equivalent thermal resistor and thermal capacitor, the innovative thermal circuit representing the room is elaborated. The methodology of the Kron's formalism, implicitly described with the different action steps is introduced. The thermal room Kron's method is implemented from the branch to mesh spaces before the expression of the problem metric. The thermal transfer functions (TTFs) at three cases of indoor points, situated near, middle and far of the door are established from the Kron's problem metric. The feasibility of the room thermal Kron's TTF model is validated with SPICE TTF simulations in both frequency and time domains. The thermal cut-off frequencies are verified with very good correlation between the established TTF model and simulation.

We propose a hybrid model to include deterministic components and the diffuse tail by combining ray tracing with a propagation graph. The recursive structure of the propagation graph allows for a computationally efficient calculation of the channel transfer function considering infinitely many components. We use ray tracing and the theory of room electromagnetics to obtain the parameter settings for the propagation graph. Thus, the proposed hybrid model does not require new or additional parameters in comparison to ray tracing.

This question is especially important for SSD users since SSDs typically down-sample the visual stimuli into low-resolution images in which zooming-in to sub-parts could significantly improve users' perception. Five blind participants used the EyeMusic with a zoom-mechanism in a virtual environment to identify cartoon figures. Using a touchscreen they could zoom into different parts of the image, identify individual facial features and integrate them into a full facial representation.

However, due to the long calculation time required for accurate 3D electromagnetic analysis, the above model must be simplified. The parameter sensitivity analysis of the ECB shows that the temperature of the eddy current generating location directly affects the braking torque. Through the 3D electromagnetic field numerical analysis, the mapping relationship between the temperature of the eddy current generating layer and the braking torque is established and brought into the transient heat transfer model.

The proposed technique does not make use of any grid detecting and synchronising infrastructure. In this scheme, the angular deviation of the synchronously rotating working frame of the converter with respect to the grid frame is estimated at the instant of transfer. This error is added as a feedback term to the phase locked loop (PLL) to the dynamics of the PLL and enhance the speed of alignment to the grid frame. A hysteresis control scheme based on the d and q axes components of the line currents, initiates the enhancement action. Further, this idea is extended to develop a new scheme for self synchronization of parallel converters without any dedicated infrastructure. The proposed scheme aligns the working frames of the parallel converters to a common working frame which makes the synchronisation possible. A power reference reset control along with the proposed algorithm also ensures the load sharing feature of the parallel converters.

It is difficult for nurses to use the skills learned from simulation training to transfer an actual patient. Therefore, we developed a robot patient that could simulate the behavior of patients' limbs for patient-transfer training. This study examined the performance of the robot used in training and evaluated its training effectiveness. Four nursing teachers individually transferred the robot patient and then scored the robot patient's ability to simulate patients' actions and its suitability for skill training. An experiment using pre-post control group design was carried out to examine the robot patient's training effectiveness compared with the human simulated patient. The participants were 20 nursing students and one nursing teacher who was responsible for scoring the students' skills in the pre-test and post-test. All of the students were assigned to train with either the proposed robot patient or a healthy person simulating the patient. The results show that all four nursing teachers regarded the robot patient's actions as realistic. In addition, all four teachers agreed that the robot patient was suitable for skill training.

Such stressing of thermal pastes was carried out to simulate the mechanical shearing action imposed on such pastes as a result of the anticipated differential motion of contacted heat-transfer surfaces and the paste during transient heating/cooling in various cooling assemblies. In the present work, the tendency of thermally conductive pastes to phase-separate during such simulated functional use was eliminated and given attributes of reworkability and corrosion inhibition by a combination of several approaches. These included: (1) the use of surface modification agents such as coupling agents and/or polymers on boron nitride particles: (2) milling conditions employed; and (3) the selection of novel oily and oxidation-resistant vehicle material systems to interact with the modified particle surfaces while preventing corrosion of contacted metallic surfaces.<>","","","10.1109/ECTC.1990.122294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=122294","","Thermal conductivity;Thermal stresses;Boron;Cooling;Corrosion;Conducting materials;Minerals;Petroleum;Shearing;Heating","conducting materials;corrosion protection;disperse systems;packaging;phase transformations;thermal conductivity of solids","phase stabilization;thermally conductive pastes;thermally conductive pastes;mineral oil;phase separation;mechanical shearing action;differential motion;contacted heat-transfer surfaces;transient heating/cooling;cooling assemblies;simulated functional use;reworkability;corrosion inhibition;surface modification agents;coupling agents;polymers;milling conditions;oxidation-resistant vehicle material systems;modified particle surfaces;contacted metallic surfaces;BN particles","","","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since regulating transformers are more and more used in modern power system, tap change has often been considered as a principal mechanism that may lead to voltage collapse, but tap change can also rescue a would-be collapse system by extending the power transfer limit. Using time domain medium-and-long term voltage stability simulation program, the influence of the action of on-load tap-changer (OLTC) on voltage stability is analyzed. The development of its high-speed communication network in real-time system and the implementation of the IEC61850 standard have made the construction of digital substations possible. Based on digital substation system, the strategies of OLTC control is given which can improve the power system stability.","2160-8644","978-1-4244-5230-9","10.1109/TD-ASIA.2009.5356914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356914","Voltage stability;OLTC;Digital substation;Communication system","Substations;Power system stability;Power system simulation;Stability analysis;Transformers;Time domain analysis;Analytical models;Voltage;Communication networks;Real time systems","IEC standards;on load tap changers;power system stability;substations","control strategy;onload tap changer;digital substation;power system stability;power transfer limit;time domain medium-and-long term voltage stability simulation program;IEC61850 standard","","1","","5","","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address the setting where the tasks share a state-action space and have the same qualitative objective but differ in dynamics. We adopt a transfer learning approach where common structure in previously-learnt policies, in the form of shared subtasks, is exploited to accelerate learning in subsequent ones. We use a probabilistic mixture model to describe regions in state space which are common to successful trajectories in different instances. Then, we extract policy fragments from previously-learnt policies that are specialised to these regions. These policy fragments are options, whose initiation and termination sets are automatically extracted from data by the mixture model. In novel task instances, these options are used in an SMDP learning process and option learning repeats over the resulting policy library. The utility of this method is demonstrated through experiments in a standard navigation environment and then in the RoboCup simulated soccer domain with opponent teams of different skill.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-6358-7","10.1109/IROS.2013.6696523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6696523","","Kernel;Probabilistic logic;Trajectory;Abstracts;Markov processes;Acceleration;Navigation","continuing professional development;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-robot systems;probability","lifelong transfer learning approach;option hierarchy;autonomous agents;state-action space;probabilistic mixture model;policy fragments;SMDP learning process;option learning;policy library;RoboCup simulated soccer domain","","3","","26","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The acceleration trend relay currently in use in the US western interconnection is an example of RAS that trips generators to maintain transient stability. Recently, a new distributed hierarchical control (DHC) architecture was proposed for multi-area power systems. In this architecture, local decentralized governor controllers were developed to improve the frequency stability. In this paper, the integration of RAS to the newly proposed DHC is investigated. Specifically, the interactions of RAS with local decentralized robust governor control are analyzed. The influence of the decentralized robust governor control on the design of RAS is studied. Benefits of combining these two schemes are increasing power transfer capability and mitigation of RAS generator tripping actions; the latter benefit is shown through simulations.","2160-8563","978-1-4799-3656-4","10.1109/TDC.2014.6863364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863364","","Robustness;Power system stability;Generators;Acceleration;Relays;Market research;Stability analysis","","","","","","","","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

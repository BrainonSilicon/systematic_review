# Hello!

This is the repo for March 2021's Systematic Literature Review

## Get Started
The purpose of this repo is to use a version control approach for the newest iteration of the systematic review.


## File Organization

This is the 'main folder' which contains info about the repo's contents and how to navigate it.
Within the 'main folder' there is:
- this README
- a 'paper_count' file (which will inform the final PRISMA diagram) which is the number of papers returned from each Database, and the number of papers included based on the various steps of exclusion/inclusion
- a 'Exclusion Criteria' folder
- a folder for each of the Databases that are searched in this review

Inside each Database's folder is:
- a README containing information about the search strategy, the specifics of the database, images of the search results, and the status (how far through it I am)
- a folder containing the raw csv files downloaded from the databases
- a file where the filters have been applied to
- a file containing the counts of the papers returned from each search term

// TODO create and add an image showing the layout of the folders

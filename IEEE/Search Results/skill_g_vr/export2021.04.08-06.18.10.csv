The technology faculty of the latter institute could be compared with the former polytechnics in the UK; however by law the difference in the Netherlands is more strict between Universities (key words: academic, research, search for general laws, universal truth, trends and patterns) and Higher Vocational Education (main goal is vocationally related: preparing for future working life, training in skills and logic of a technology). For some disciplines, Product Design Engineering being one of them, it means that there is not a smooth transfer possible for students having acquired the Hogeschool title, Ing, to the University and the Ir title within a reasonable time span. At the other hand, in special cases like the Technical Business Science course at the university of Groningen, in which the vocational approach and expertise of Hogeschool lecturers is incorporated in the academic curriculum, the combination can be very beneficial.

Although a game-specific value function is not required for this approach, significant improvements in performance may be achieved by derandomising the MC simulations using domain-specific knowledge. However, recent results suggest that the choice of a non-uniformly random default policy is non-trivial and may often lead to unexpected outcomes. In this paper we employ Temporal Difference Learning (TDL) as a general approach to the integration of domain-specific knowledge in MCTS and subsequently study its impact on the algorithm's performance. In particular, TDL is used to learn a linear function approximator that is used as an a priori bias to the move selection in the algorithm's default policy; the function approximator is also used to bias the values of the nodes in the tree directly. The goal of this work is to determine whether such a simplistic approach can be used to improve the performance of MCTS for the well-known board game Othello.

However, robotic skill learning must typically make trade-offs to enable practical real-world learning, such as requiring manually designed policy or value function representations, initialization from human demonstrations, instrumentation of the training environment, or extremely long training times. We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm that can train general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. We build on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle random initial states, allowing it to be used even when deterministic resets are impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search algorithms in simulation, showing that it can train high-dimensional neural network policies with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and can learn policies directly from image pixels. We also present real-world robot results that show that our method can learn manipulation policies with visual features and random initial states.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989383","","Robots;Global Positioning System;Neural networks;Learning (artificial intelligence);Supervised learning;Training;Optimization","learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;robots","reset-free guided policy search;deep reinforcement learning;stochastic initial states;autonomous learning;robotic skill learning;general-purpose neural network policies;GPS algorithm;high-dimensional neural network policies;image pixels","","7","","23","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research quantifies PSA through bio-behavioral markers related to individuals' physiological and acoustic characteristics. The effect of virtual reality (VR) training on alleviating PSA is measured through self-reported and bio-behavioral indices. Psychological (e.g., general trait anxiety, personality) and demographic (e.g., age, gender, highest education, native language) traits are examined as moderating factors between bio-behavioral indices and PSA, as well as moderating factors for measuring the VR effectiveness in mitigating PSA. These measures are also used as clustering criteria for stratifying participants in group-based models of PSA. Results indicate the significance of such traits to modeling PSA with the proposed group-based models yielding Spearman's correlation of 0:55 ($p \lt 0:05$) between the actual and predicted outcome. Results further demonstrate that systematic exposure to public speaking in VR can alleviate PSA in terms of both self-reported ($p \lt 0:05$) and physiological ($p \lt 0:05$) indices.

Mountainous terrain, however, still poses a challenge for NWP models, mainly due to not sufficient resolution of the underlying topography, but also due to physical parameterizations based on assumptions for horizontally homogeneous and flat (hhf) terrain. In our study, we evaluate the performance of the high-resolution NWP model COSMO in complex terrain, namely in the Inn Valley, Austria. We compare the measurements of two representative weather stations (one located at the valley floor and one located at a north-facing slope) with the model and investigate the spatial variability of the simulated flow field. The model is generally able to simulate the thermally-induced circulation in the valley appropriately, however, there are differences between the two locations. The model has a worse skill at the slope site, which may be related to poorly resolved topography. Further, the model exhibits problems in simulating boundary-layer processes at both stations, which supports the hypothesis of insufficient parameterization of boundary-layer processes in complex terrain.","","978-1-5090-2088-1","10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568428","Atmospheric Science;Numerical Weather Prediction;Model Evaluation;Complex Terrain","Atmospheric modeling;Numerical models;Wind;Computational modeling;Weather forecasting;Surfaces","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric movements;geophysics computing;parallel processing;topography (Earth);weather forecasting","numerical weather prediction;complex terrain;topography representation;weather forecasting;forecast quality;high-performance computing;horizontal grid resolution;mountainous terrain;physical parameterization;horizontally homogeneous and flat terrain;high-resolution NWP model;COSMO model;Inn Valley;Austria;representative weather station;spatial variability;thermally-induced circulation;valley;boundary-layer process","","4","","31","","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address that problem, we propose two approaches to transferring robot perception module, which are based on domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), respectively. The former approach tries to extract domain-invariant features by a shared feature extractor and use the domain-invariant features to train a transferrable target localization model (TLM). Meanwhile, the latter approach attempts to learn a transformation from the source domain to the target domain and use the transformation to generate realistic synthetic samples. Then, the synthetic samples are exploited as training data for the TLM. The experiments show that given enough simulated data and only a small amount of real world data, the TLM adapted by our methods could generalize well to real-world environments without drastic performance decline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923541","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737927","Robotic grasping;skill transfer;domain adversarial neural networks (DANN);generative adversarial networks (GAN)","Robots;Feature extraction;Data models;Adaptation models;Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks;Training","intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","adversarial learning;robotic control;simulated environments;deep neural networks;simulated data;domain adversarial neural networks;generative adversarial networks;domain-invariant features;shared feature extractor;transferrable target localization model;TLM;source domain;target domain;training data;robot perception module","","","","35","CCBY","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A multi-layered artificial neural network is used to learn and generalize the joint driving torque against various desired ball velocities, and an iterative optimal control algorithm is adopted to generate the supervisory joint driving torque signals for the neural network. Computer simulation examples of a three-degree-of-freedom manipulator are outlined, the results are depicted to explain the idea and verify the proposed approach, and the robustness issues are discussed qualitatively.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.845160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845160","","Manipulator dynamics;Orbital robotics;Artificial neural networks;Iterative methods;Torque;Optimal control;Iterative algorithms;Signal generators;Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network","optimal control;learning systems;multilayer perceptrons;digital simulation;manipulator dynamics;neurocontrollers;robust control","dynamic pattern generating architecture;skilful robotic baseball batting system;dynamic manipulation;robotic manipulators;joint driving torque patterns;multi-layered artificial neural network;iterative optimal control algorithm;supervisory joint driving torque signals;three-degree-of-freedom manipulator;robustness issues","","1","","11","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, online handwriting data is a multidimensional time series comprises of time series of pen-tips position (x, y), pressure, altitude, azimuth etc.. In case of person verification application, use of such multivariate data improves verification accuracy. However increase of data volume increases computational cost for analysis. In this study, in order to reduce data volume , we propose a new method for extraction of the basic feature points of multidimensional handwriting time series from the view point of testing determinism in the underlying dynamics behind handwriting. Proposed method is based on two-dimensional recurrence map of translation error. Basic feature points denote the principal points in the trajectory of handwriting dynamics to preserve the rough form of the individual's handwriting speciality. The simulation experiment has been done with SVC 2004 online handwriting signature data. The result shows that the basic feature point series is quite sufficient for analyzing the data for identity detection while the raw handwriting time series includes redundancy.","","978-1-4244-4642-1","10.1109/COGINF.2009.5250789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5250789","Auto translation error map;basic feature points;determinism;handwriting verification;recurrence plot","Data mining;Time series analysis;Multidimensional systems;Handwriting recognition;Azimuth;Computational efficiency;Testing;Static VAr compensators;Data analysis;Redundancy","handwriting recognition;time series","basic feature points;handwriting data;auto translation error map;online-handwritten time series;pen tablet system;handwriting recognition;person verification;skill analysis;multidimensional time series;two-dimensional recurrence map","","","","13","","18 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Objectives: Develop an AI-based interview simulator for helping novice requirements engineers in gaining interview skills. Methods: The research is based on the Design Science Methodology for Information Systems. The simulator is the outcome of six cycles; in each cycle, a proof of concept with additional features is created. Each cycle finishes with evaluation and improvement suggestions. Results: The simulator has been tested with students and results have been promising. The interview simulator understands context-free questions, retrieving the right information related to RE concepts such as goals, tasks, users, benefits, and constraints. The simulator also answers questions based on the context, makes summaries of the conversation, responds to meta-questions, and adds ambiguity and incompleteness to the conversation. Conclusions: The results have been promising. The simulator has been tested with degree and master level students. They were able to create a requirements specification using the simulator, and the feedback has been generally positive. The simulator will be tested in a real RE course in the academic year 2020-2021. Once it proves effective in the classroom, it will be opened to the RE community for free use and improvement.","2164-0297","978-1-7281-8348-0","10.1109/REET51203.2020.00007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216178","Requirements elicitation;chatbots;interviews;training","Interviews;Training;Security;Software;Solid modeling;Navigation;Design methodology","computer aided instruction;formal specification;human computer interaction;information systems;interactive systems;software agents","design science methodology;context-free questions;requirements specification;chatbot-based interview simulator;novice requirements engineers;requirements elicitation technique;adequate training;requirements engineering courses;interview skills","","","","37","","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the assumption that these discs are axisymmetric and thin, the proposed method yields a unique distribution compatible with all the observables available. The derivation may be carried out from the measurement of the azimuthal velocity distribution arising from positioning the slit of a spectrograph along the major axis of the galaxy. More generally, it may account for the simultaneous measurements of velocity distributions corresponding to slits presenting arbitrary orientations with respect to the major axis. The approach is non-parametric, i.e. it does not rely on a particular algebraic model for the distribution function. Special care is taken to account for the fraction of counter-rotating stars, which strongly affects the stability of the disc.An optimization algorithm is devised — generalizing the work of Skilling &38; Bryan — to carry this truly two-dimensional ill-conditioned inversion efficiently. The performance of the overall inversion technique with respect to the noise level and truncation in the data set is investigated with simulated data. Reliable results are obtained up to a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 5, and when measurements are available up to 4 R e . A discussion of the residual biases involved in non-parametric inversions is presented. The prospects of application of the algorithm to observed galaxies and other inversion problems are discussed.","1365-2966","","10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.02026.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8177507","methods: data analysis;methods: numerical;galaxies: general;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","1","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The balance has recently tipped in favor of specific packages. These, however, inhibit the development of programming skills for active, innovative and dynamic education processes. One reason is that the syntax of traditional languages adds one more level of distraction to the point that the engineering context of the problem may be lost. The recent emergence of graphical programming languages for engineers (such as LabVIEW) remedies this situation by providing an environment which focuses on the process. The modularity of such languages enables the instructor to adjust the programming challenge so that the engineering content of the problem may be highlighted. In this paper, three representative problems from the subjects of manufacturing, dynamics and component design are selected to illustrate the use of a graphical programming language to both introduce early basic engineering and programming concepts and in the solution of typical mechanical engineering problems. These problems are all parametric in nature and simulate real world problems.","0190-5848","0-7803-2413-7","10.1109/FIE.1994.580474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=580474","","Technological innovation;Education;Mechanical engineering;Dynamic programming;Programming profession;Computer languages;Application software;Software packages;Problem-solving;Packaging","mechanical engineering","mechanical engineering;teaching;education;software packages;high level problem solving;programming skills;graphical programming languages;applications","","1","","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into “task-specific” and “robot-specific” modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training. Using a novel approach to train modular neural networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual and non-visual tasks.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989250","","Neural networks;Robot sensing systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Games;Training;Visualization","dexterous manipulators;directed graphs;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics;manipulator kinematics;multi-robot systems;neural nets;robot vision","modular neural network policy learning;multitask multirobot transfer learning;robotic skills;deep reinforcement learning;general purpose modular neural network policy training;RL;task-specific modules;robot-specific modules;robot dynamics;robot kinematics;mix-and-match modules;zero-shot generalization;visual tasks;nonvisual tasks","","27","","34","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Actual walls are generally composed of multiple (thin) layers and may be exposed to solar irradiance. Modeling the wall construction explicitly can be tedious (because of complexities at wall intersections) and also problematic, as the computational grid required in the wall may be much finer than that of the adjacent fluid region. This is an issue particularly in preliminary design applications where a coarse grid is most efficient. The disparity in grid length scale can dramatically increase solution times and negatively impact robustness, resulting in the need for a large overall cell count to achieve low-aspect-ratio cells. To avoid these liabilities, we introduce a compact (steadystate and transient) mathematical model that accounts for solar heat flux and three-dimensional heat transfer, and requires no physical grid cells in the thickness-direction of the wall. We validate the compact wall model's predictions against detailed numerical benchmarks and find that it accurately predicts both temporal and spatial temperature variations. The primary value of the model is that it can be built into applicationspecific CFD tools (e.g., for analyzing modular systems) so that wall heat transfer and thermal mass can be accurately modeled with minimum user effort or modeling skill.","","978-1-5090-2994-5","10.1109/ITHERM.2017.7992483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992483","computational fluid dynamics;conduction model;compact wall model;thermal network;solar load;modular systems;containers","Erbium;Conferences","computational fluid dynamics;flow simulation;heat transfer","compact wall model;CFD simulation;multiple layer;solar irradiance;adjacent fluid region;low-aspect-ratio cells;compact mathematical model;solar heat flux;three-dimensional heat transfer;physical grid cells;wall thickness-direction;numerical benchmarks;spatial temperature variations;temporal temperature variations;thermal mass","","","","14","","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a method to generate a large scale synthetic dataset with ground truth, which we refer to as the Jacquard grasping dataset. Jacquard is built on a subset of ShapeNet, a large CAD models dataset, and contains both RGB-D images and annotations of successful grasping positions based on grasp attempts performed in a simulated environment. We carried out experiments using an off-the-shelf CNN, with three different evaluation metrics, including real grasping robot trials. The results show that Jacquard enables much better generalization skills than a human labeled dataset thanks to its diversity of objects and grasping positions.

Action-level imitation involves two modules. The viewpoint transformation (VPT) performs a ""rotation"" to align the demonstrator's body to that of the learner. The visuo-motor map (VMM) maps this visual information to motor data. For program-level (gesture) imitation, there is an additional module that allows the system to recognize and generate its own interpretation of observed gestures to produce similar gestures/goals at a later stage. Besides the holistic approach to the problem, our approach differs from traditional work in i) the use of motor information for gesture recognition; ii) usage of context (e.g., object affordances) to focus the attention of the recognition system and reduce ambiguities, and iii) use iconic image representations for the hand, as opposed to fitting kinematic models to the video sequence. This approach is motivated by the finding of visuomotor neurons in the F5 area of the macaque brain that suggest that gesture recognition/imitation is performed in motor terms (mirror) and rely on the use of object affordances (canonical) to handle ambiguous actions.

This experimental study used pre- and post-test questionnaires, Think Aloud Protocol (TAP), and observation methods at the University of East Anglia (UEA). The students engaged in recorded video, audio, and screen session as they searched academic resources. They had a free choice of search tool(s) on the topic of their study, specific to their needs. The study also used questionnaires and interviews with UEA faculty. A total of 64 subjects participated in the research. Forty-eight students were classified into three groups (undergraduates, masters, and PhD students) composed of 16 participants each; an additional 16 faculty members participated in the questionnaires and interviews. Participants were selected from all UEA faculties and included a mix of nationalities and genders. Results showed that user needs, skills, and persistence differ with respect to academic searching-they increase as education levels increase. In addition, results showed that users generally prefer using search tools because of their overall usability rather than dealing with online databases, even though such databases may be more effective. The study concludes that education level plays an important role-given the complex nature of huge amounts of information on the Web-in adopting different techniques and advanced search tools.","","978-0-9893193-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661724","Web searching behavior;usability study;end user study;search academic resources","Usability;Education;Interviews;Internet;Human computer interaction;Web search;Search engines","educational administrative data processing;human factors;Internet","academic resources searching;search tools;screen session;audio session;recorded video session;UEA;University of East Anglia;observation methods;TAP;Think Aloud Protocol;search process;user education levels;Web searching behaviour","","","","43","","14 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research was, in the first years, directed towards development of low level skills and positional co-ordination. The competitive level has in between risen to new standards, which makes the development of highlevel co-operation necessary. The importance of the concept of Setplay, i.e., small multirobot plans to deal with particular situations, to structure a robotic soccer team behaviour, has been acknowledged by many researchers, but no general framework for the development and execution of generic Setplays has been introduced in the context of RoboCup. This paper presents such a framework for high-level Setplay definition and execution in the 2D simulation league, though applicable to any RoboCup co-operative league and similar domains. The framework is built upon a standard, flexible and league-independent language, which defines Setplays that are interpreted and executed at run-time, using inter-robot communication. A major step in the development of the Setplay framework is its usage and testing in the scope of the FCPortugal team, which participates in the RoboCup 2D-simulation league, where it won several titles. After this successful implementation, described in this paper, the framework will be used in the mid-size league, and possibly in other new environments. Recent developments have made it possible to use Setplays in play-on situations, which had not been possible before. Also, a graphical tool for Setplay definition has been developed, and used in the context of this team.","2158-219X","978-1-4244-6506-4","10.1109/RAMECH.2010.5513166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5513166","","Standards development;Runtime;Computational modeling;Robot kinematics;Communication standards;Testing;Context;Humans;Orbital robotics;Counting circuits","mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;path planning;sport","RoboCup 2D simulation league;flexible multi-robot plans;strategic planning;multi-agent coordination;Setplay;robotic soccer team;FCPortugal team;interrobot communication","","11","","10","","19 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is a much larger population of patients with some residual motor function as well as the general population of able-bodied individuals, both of whom could benefit significantly from BCIs. An important question that has yet to be systematically studied is: can subjects use BCIs simultaneously with overt motor activity? We present results from a preliminary study aimed at exploring this question. Three subjects used hand motor imagery in an electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI while simultaneously using a joystick to control a cursor. Particular attention was paid to preventing potential muscle artifacts from influencing imagery-based control. All three subjects were able to use the hybrid “imagery+joystick” mode of control over two days, demonstrating the ability to learn and significantly improve performance. These results suggest that subjects can potentially augment their normal human sensorimotor capability by exercising direct brain control over devices concurrently with overt motor control.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347535","","Electroencephalography;Human factors;Brain computer interfaces;Electromyography;Muscles;Electrodes;Training","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;handicapped aids;muscle","brain-computer interfacing;motor control;noninvasive BCI;paralyzed individuals;locked-in individuals;residual motor function;electroencephalographic BCI;EEG BCI;joystick;muscle artifact","Adult;Brain;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Humans;Imagery (Psychotherapy);Learning;Male;Motor Skills;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors;Young Adult","1","","9","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the FRA test along with the equipment are well developed, interpretation of FRA signature is still a challenge and it needs skilled personnel to identify and quantify the fault type if exists as at this stage, there is no reliable standard code for FRA signature classification and quantification. As it is very hard to implement faults on physical transformer without damaging it, researchers investigated the impact of various mechanical winding deformations on the transformer FRA signature by randomly changing the value of particular electrical parameters of the transformer equivalent electrical circuit. None of them however, precisely investigated the correlation between physical fault level and the percentage change in each parameter. In this paper, the physical geometrical dimension of a single-phase transformer is simulated using 3D finite element analysis to emulate the real transformer operation. A physical radial deformation of different fault levels is simulated on both low voltage and high voltage windings. The impact of each fault level on the electrical parameters of the equivalent circuit is investigated and the correlation between the fault level and the percentage change in each parameter of the equivalent circuit is provided. This will facilitate precise fault simulation using transformer equivalent electrical circuit and ease the quantification analysis of FRA signature.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2014.004592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033430","Power transformer;condition monitoring;FRA;buckling deformation;Radial faults;Insulator winding Integrity","Windings;Circuit faults;Power transformer insulation;Capacitance;Phase transformers;Inductance","deformation;equivalent circuits;fault diagnosis;finite element analysis;frequency response;power transformers;transformer windings","power transformer winding fault detection;frequency response analysis;FRA diagnostics;winding deformation detection;skilled personnel;mechanical winding deformations;FRA signature;equivalent electrical circuit;physical fault level;physical geometrical dimension;3D finite element analysis;physical radial deformation","","33","","26","","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Successful programs depended heavily on interaction between educators and the professional engineers in the work force. Political priorities, both state and national, have played a major role in determining scope and success. Global issues are essential in most curricula since economic factors alone present major integrated components that engineers must understand. There are extraordinary opportunities, obstacles, and dangers ahead because we now are embroiled in the arena of ""knowledge management,"" where massive information interconnections are expanding among businesses, universities, and political systems. This will create problems of privacy, ethics, and value in the absence of an honest and rigorous work force. Although we have made great progress in electrical engineering curricular transitioning, there is much to do, as Dr. Vartan Gregorian (Carnegie Corp.) predicts: ""Laser communications, nuclear power, biotechnology, networked computers, and the like are precisely shaping our habits of thought and desire. They have become a dominant source of our culture, even to changing the very paradigms of knowledge. Rapidly evolving global communications are bringing social changes that are so complex and far-reaching they are not amenable to easy understanding."" As education moved into the 21st century, business and society in general recognized the significance of ""learning anywhere, anytime."" Enabled through the powerful mechanism of communications and networking, education and industry quickly recognized the need for a new trained work force. Education saw the extraordinary advantage of combining their faculty with visiting faculty from industry, forming an integrated and multidisciplinary team. Transforming Engineering Education has been led by electrical engineering departments with support from IEEE and corporations like IBM. During this historic transition, input from students became increasingly important as they examined new careers combining fields like engineering, medicine, health care, business, science, and management, to name a few. Lifelong learning has long been a core priority for IEEE and IBM. Lifelong learning and ""anywhere and anytime"" courses clearly will get better because they will have the support of an extraordinary, dynamic network that is the platform for implementation. Interactions between people and programs are expanding understanding of terms like ""knowledge management and computer simulations"" driven by common sense evaluations and the continual search for and emphasis on the meaning or role of ""wisdom"" in these gigantic digital warehouses of data. Michael Crichton continually reminds us of the fragility of networks susceptible to misuse or misdirection resulting in catastrophic consequences for society. In this paper, three transition-based programs are reviewed: 1. A long-term university/corporation agreement involving technical management and product research 2. Creation of a unique College of Integrated Science and Technology at James Madison University in Virginia 3. A major governor-sponsored West Virginia technology bill aimed at statewide support of economic development and educational change implemented under Senate Bill 547. These programs had in common the following goals: for our students - the competitive advantage for the jobs of the future. for our educators - the technological resources for uncompromised quality of content and access.","","978-1-4244-6042-7","10.1109/TEE.2010.5508832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508832","","Engineering education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Power generation economics;Knowledge management;Electrical engineering;Educational programs;Economic forecasting;Privacy;Ethics","continuing professional development;educational courses;engineering education;knowledge management","engineering education;education transition;political priorities;global issues;knowledge management;lifelong learning;anywhere-and-anytime courses;transition-based programs","","3","","22","","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a work in progress, we report on the first phase of an experiment at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) using a sophomore-level humanities course to teach information literacy. Students develop a pedagogical role-play game to explore a historical situation simulating engineered solutions. The game offers the advantages of project-based learning within a traditionally framed classroom environment, and before students address complex engineering problems within their major areas of study. To assess the effectiveness of our educational approach we reviewed the quality and type of sources located by students and completed a textual analysis of students' reflective essays.

Instead of having all the students in the class perform identical activities (homework, experiments, tests, etc.), a cadre of assignments is made available to them and they may choose and perform (within reason) the ones that suit them better in terms of their own strengths and learning styles. The ultimate goal is for each student to demonstrate a minimum level of competence in all basic skills (analytical, computational, experimental, design, and communication) while pursuing excellence in at least one of them.

To make robots learn the multiple peg-in-hole assembly skills from experience efficiently and stably, the learning process is driven by the basic knowledge like PD force control strategy. To achieve a fast learning process in the real-world assembly tasks, a hybrid exploration strategy is applied to drive a efficient exploration during policy search phase. A dual peg-in-hole assembly simulation and real-world experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The performance measured by the assembly time and the maximum contact forces demonstrates that the multiple peg-in-hole assembly skills could be improved only after 150 training episodes in dual peg-in-hole assembly task.","","978-1-7281-0377-8","10.1109/ROBIO.2018.8665255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8665255","","Task analysis;Robotic assembly;Force;Robot sensing systems;Aerospace electronics;Process control","force control;learning (artificial intelligence);PD control;position control;robotic assembly","dynamic contact states;learned skills;general learning-based algorithm;PD force control strategy;knowledge-driven deep deterministic policy gradient;robotic multiple peg-in-hole assembly tasks;DDPG","","5","","16","","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It would be desirable to easily acquire appropriate motion patterns for skill learning between dissimilar bodies to attain the goal of the demonstrated motion. This requires neural oscillator networks to adapt to the non-periodic nature of arbitrary input patterns exploiting their entrainment properties. However, even in the most widely-used Matsuoka oscillator, when an unknown quasi-periodic or non-periodic signal is applied, its output signal is not always closely entrained. Therefore, current neural oscillator models may not be applied to the proposed goal-directed imitation for skill learning. To solve this problem, a supplementary term is newly included in the equation of Matsuoka oscillator. We verify general properties of the proposed model of the neural oscillator and illustrate in particular its enhanced entrainment by numerical simulation. We also show the possibility of controlling dynamic responses of oscillator-coupled mechanical systems.

For this reason, it is not easy for students to prepare environment to be able to practice freely at any time. Therefore, we have developed a hands-on practical learning system to learn IP network skills on general performance PC. Unlike existing network simulators, this system does not require students to learn scripting language to make scenarios. This system enables students to practice network skills freely and virtually on just one PC. We have implemented this system by applying the virtual Linux environment User Mode Linux. This system consists of virtual routers, virtual hosts, and operating functions. This system is primarily intended to practice operation of routing on virtual routers.

That is, the machine must be able to build up its skill in the domain automatically in the form of appropriate control actions triggered by the sensed state variables. In machine learning adaptive control the control scheme is independent of the mathematical modelling of the object dynamics and the precise estimation of its physical parameters. The article presents the authors own work, and that of others, on rules for controlling dynamic systems, and for designing robust rule-based controllers, efficient and adaptable, that has been applied in numerous simulations and to physical process control. The work reported catalogues experiments into intelligent control by human-supervised learning, passive learning, and machine learning. The work started with observing human-supervised learning, these observations led to the development of generalised rules for an automatic controller. Later, when this controller was applied to the physical system, the sensed outputs were post-processed by the c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm to demonstrate passive learning. Passive learning of this type provided feedback and allowed a direct comparison to be made between human and machine generated rules.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=181122","","Adaptive control;Digital control;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems","adaptive control;computerised control;knowledge based systems;learning systems","intelligent control;skill transfer;efficient control design;expert controller;machine learning adaptive control;robust rule-based controllers;human-supervised learning;passive learning;c4.5 induction rule generation algorithm;feedback","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The results were evaluated against ground-based observations of snowpack physical properties and microwave radiometric observations from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) observations at 18-19-, 22-23-, and 36-37-GHz vertical and horizontal polarizations (V-pol and H-pol, respectively). Whereas snow water equivalent (SWE) results are similar to the results obtained with single-layer physics when the snow is dry, the multilayer physics have a better skill at capturing the overall temporal evolution of bulk density, snow temperature, and snow depth during the accumulation season, and at the onset and throughout the melting season. However, snow density profiles overestimate density at the bottom of the snowpack, consistent with the lack of an explicit representation of depth hoar in the rearrangement of mass and grain size distribution in the snowpack. Regarding the radiometric behavior, the multilayer SMMR OSS for Valdai shows improved results for nighttime simulations (descending SMMR paths, 11 P.M. LST) and H-pol (~ 3-5 K decrease in error statistics), particularly at 37 GHz. For daytime simulations (ascending SMMR paths, 11 A.M. LST), there are modest improvements at 18 (~ 1 K) and 37 GHz (~ 2-3 K) for H-pol, and generally loss of skill for V-pol at all frequencies. Systematic improvements at nighttime but not during daytime suggest that surface heterogeneities, including subgrid scale variability of transient melting, play an important role on surface emissivity. This is the case for cold land process experiment in Colorado, where spatial variability in fractional forest cover, geology, and complex topography explains the modest differences between the single and multilayer SSM/I OSS for H-pol, whereas significant gains (~ 4-8 K decrease in error statistics) were attained for V-pol at 37 GHz only. For AMSR-E, the multilayer OSS looses skill for H-pol, and only bias and mean absolute error improve for V-pol at all frequencies. These somewhat mixed results suggest that representation of snow stratigraphy alone is not sufficient to improve the OSS ability to describe the nonlinear interactions among hydrologic and electromagnetic processes. Chief among these are the temporal evolution of snow correlation length with depth and the representation of subgrid scale variability constrained by the spatial resolution and inherent uncertainty of the meteorological forcing. Nevertheless, the multilayer OSS improved performance at 37 GHz is an important finding toward reducing ambiguity in the sensitivity of 37-GHz H-pol brightness temperature to SWE in retrieval models.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2169074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6069586","Electromagnetic propagation in absorbing media;multi-layer;nonhomogeneous media;snow hydrology","Snow;Nonhomogeneous media;Microwave radiometry;Atmospheric modeling;Microwave imaging;Adaptation models;Microwave FET integrated circuits","data analysis;forestry;grain size;hydrological techniques;land surface temperature;microwave measurement;radiometry;snow;topography (Earth)","system simulation method;snow microwave emissions;data sparse regions;multilayer physics;multilayer formulation;snow hydrological process;snow hydrology-emission model;system simulation mode;physiographic regions;climatic regions;Valdai;Russia;Colorado;USA;dry snow regimes;wet snow regimes;ground-based observations;snowpack physical properties;microwave radiometric observations;scanning multichannel microwave radiometer;Special Sensor Microwave/Imager;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS observations;horizontal polarization analysis;vertical polarization analysis;snow water equivalent;single-layer physics;bulk density temporal evolution;snow temperature;snow depth;snow density profiles;grain size distribution;snowpack bottom region;radiometric behavior;multilayer SMMR OSS;daytime simulation method;surface heterogeneity analysis;subgrid scale variability;surface emissivity analysis;Colorado;spatial variability;fractional forest cover;complex topography;AMSR-E;mean absolute error analysis;snow stratigraphy representation;electromagnetic process;hydrologic process;temporal evolution;snow correlation length;H-pol brightness temperature;frequency 18 GHz to 19 GHz;frequency 22 GHz to 23 GHz;frequency 36 GHz to 37 GHz","","6","","56","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Poor stress management, besides the lack of skills, can be a direct cause of poor performance under stress, both in the selection process of ATCOs and later in the workplace. 40 ATC candidates, within the final stages of their selection process, underwent a stimulation paradigm for elicitation and assessment of various generic task-unrelated physiological features, related to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), acoustic startle response (ASR) and the physiological allostatic response, which are all recognized as relevant psychophysiological markers of stress resilience. The multimodal approach included analysis of electrocardiography, electromyography, electrodermal activity and respiration. We make advances in computational methodology for assessment of physiological features of stress resilience, and investigate the predictive power of the obtained feature space in a binary classification problem: prediction of high- vs. low-performance on the developed ATC simulator.

Human workers usually accumulate his experience after executing the same task repetitively. In the process of training, the worker must find ways of adjusting his/her execution. In our system, the parameters for the impedance control scheme are used as the targets for adjustment. After mass amount of training, the worker is supposed to be able to execute deburring tasks successfully. This is because the worker might have gotten some knowledge about tuning the parameters required in the impedance control scheme. Thus, the rules for adjusting the parameters in impedance control are the operational skills to be identified. In this research, a training scheme, called the evolution-based virtual training scheme, is proposed in extracting knowledge for robotic deburring tasks. In this approach, an evolution strategy is employed for searching for the best set of fuzzy rules. This learning scheme has been successfully applied in adjusting the parameters of impedance controllers required in deburring operations. In general, the results of deburring are much more satisfactory when compared with those in previous research.

Our goal is to develop, implement and refine a system that will assess and improve the eye-hand coordination and grip strength in children diagnosed with poor graphomotor skills. A detailed analysis of patters (e.g., labyrinths, letters and angles) was conducted in order to select three very distinguishable levels of difficulty that could be included in the system, and which would yield the greatest benefit in terms of assessment of coordination and strength issues as well as in training. Support algorithms (position, force, velocity, inertia and viscosity) were also developed and incorporated into the tasks in order to introduce general computer assistance to the mapping of the user's movements to the computer screen without overriding the user's commands to the robotic device. In order to evaluate performance (given by %accuracy and time) of the executed tasks, a sophisticated evaluation function was designed based on image analysis and edge detection algorithms. This paper presents the development of the haptic tasks, the various assistance algorithms, the description of the evaluation function and the results of a study implemented at the Motor Development Clinic at Cal Poly Pomona. The results (Accuracy and Time) of this function are currently being used as inputs to an Intelligent Decision Support System (described in), which in turn, suggests the next task to be executed by the subject based on his/her performance.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-9862-8","10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975423","","Force;Haptic interfaces;Image edge detection;Accuracy;Robot kinematics;Pixel","biomechanics;decision support systems;edge detection;haptic interfaces;medical computing;medical disorders;medical image processing;medical robotics;neurophysiology;paediatrics;patient rehabilitation","eye-hand coordination robotic therapy;children related diagnosis;robotic mapping;haptic user interface;virtual environment;grip strength;poor graphomotor skills;labyrinths;support algorithms;computer assistance;user movements;image analysis;edge detection algorithm;haptic tasks;Motor Development Clinic;Cal Poly Pomona;intelligent decision support system","Algorithms;Child;Eye;Hand;Humans;Movement;Robotics;Robotics","3","","15","","11 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We find that transfer learning employed in this context leads to a significant acceleration of learning.

Once this latent space is learned, we plan over continuous latent actions in a model-predictive control fashion, using a learned high-level dynamics model. This framework generalizes to multiple robots, and we present results on a Daisy hexapod simulation, A1 quadruped simulation, and Daisy robot hardware. We compare a range of learned hierarchical approaches from literature, and show that our framework outperforms baselines on multiple tasks and two simulations. In addition to learning approaches, we also compare to inverse-kinematics (IK) acting on desired robot motion, and show that our fully-learned framework outperforms IK in adverse settings on both A1 and Daisy simulations. On hardware, we show the Daisy hexapod achieve multiple locomotion tasks, in an unstructured outdoor setting, with only 2000 hardware samples, reinforcing the robustness and sample-efficiency of our approach.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2021.3062342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9363629","Legged locomotion;motion planning;robot control;robot learning","Robots;Task analysis;Aerospace electronics;Hardware;Planning;Legged locomotion;Trajectory","","","","","","33","IEEE","25 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by incorporating the deterministic learning with the broad learning system that can accumulate and reuse the learned knowledge.

For this purpose a teleoperation system is realized that allows a human to control a simulated robotic hand and to grasp objects in a virtual environment. Haptic rendering algorithms are implemented to calculate interaction forces that occur when touching the virtual object. While learning of fingertip interaction forces is shown to result in physical inconsistency compared to the demonstrations, we show that learning of internal tensions leads to stable reproductions of the demonstrated grasping skill.

Endovascular intervention is a minimally invasive surgical approach to treat such diseases. Compared to open surgery, it has the advantages of faster recovery, reduced need for general anesthesia, reduced blood loss and significantly lower mortality. Endovascular procedures require high surgical skills to minimize contacts between the manipulated instruments (catheters and guidewires) and the vessel wall, which represent one of the major risks for the patient. Robotic assistance can potentially improve the precision and stability of instruments manipulation. One key limitation of current commercial robotic platforms is the lack of haptic feedback, preventing their acceptance and limiting the clinical usability. This paper proposes to bring the benefit of haptic feedback to robot-assisted endovascular intervention. Here we hypothesize that the introduction of 3D haptic guidance during robot-assisted endovascular procedure can further improve the surgical performance and safety while overcoming the limitations of currently available technology. The proposed 3D haptic guidance allows the surgeon to sense the vasculature while controlling a catheter through a robotic haptic manipulator. Validation of the system is performed through end-user experiments with vascular surgeons on a bespoke surgical simulator. The obtained results demonstrate that 3D haptic guidance has the potential of improving effectiveness, precision, and safety of endovascular intervention. Furthermore, vascular surgeons found the proposed technology safe and overall easy to use, indicating its potential on real surgical procedures.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967712","","","blood;blood vessels;cardiology;catheters;diseases;haptic interfaces;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery","haptic guidance;robotic haptic manipulator;vascular surgeons;surgical simulator;surgical procedures;robot-assisted endovascular procedure;vascular diseases;ischemic heart disease;stroke;minimally invasive surgical approach;reduced blood loss;endovascular procedures;manipulated instruments;robotic assistance;instruments manipulation;commercial robotic platforms;haptic feedback;robot-assisted endovascular intervention;surgical performance;3D haptic guidance;vasculature;catheter;endovascular intervention","","1","","24","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a new biologically inspired concept learning approach based on the Bayesian framework is proposed. This approach exploits and extends the mirror neuron's role in conceptualization for a reinforcement learning agent in nondeterministic environments. In the proposed method, an agent sequentially learns the concepts from both of its successes and its failures through interaction with the environment. These characteristics as a whole distinguish the proposed learning algorithm from positive sample learning. Simulation results show the correct formation of concepts' distributions in perceptual space in addition to benefits of utilizing both successes and failures in terms of convergence speed as well as asymptotic behavior. Experimental results, on the other hand, show the applicability and effectiveness of our method for a real robotic task such as wall-following.","2159-6255","978-1-4244-1263-1","10.1109/AIM.2007.4412531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412531","","Bayesian methods;Learning;Mirrors;Neurons;Decision making;Orbital robotics;Uncertainty;Encoding;Biological information theory;Signal processing","Bayes methods;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;neural nets;probability","Bayesian approach;reinforcement learning agent;cognition economy;generalization skill;knowledge communication;biologically inspired concept learning approach;action-based conceptualization;nondeterministic environment;robotic wall-following task;mirror neuron;probability method","","4","","12","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning to coordinate with other people requires a long training time and is often limited by the difficulty of having people available at the same time and of giving them accurate and real-time feedback about their coordination. The goal of the present study was to determine in an indoor team rowing situation whether virtual-reality and motion-capture technologies can help the acquisition of interpersonal coordination. More specifically, we investigated the possibility for participants to (1) learn the skill of interpersonal coordination when training with a virtual teammate, (2) accelerate learning with real-time visual feedback, and (3) transfer this skill to synchronizing situations with a real teammate. Our results show that participants improved their coordination with both virtual and real teammates, and that this improvement was better for participants who received the feedback. Generally, our results demonstrate the interest of virtual reality for learning the coordination with other people; further, our results open promising training perspectives for team rowing but also for several other interpersonal activities.","1054-7460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818592","","","","","","1","","","","20 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

However, during generalisation of skills or transitioning across fundamentally different skills, it is unclear whether the robot has the necessary knowledge to perform the task. Failing to detect missing information often leads to abrupt movements or to collisions with the environment. Active learning can quantify the uncertainty of performing the task and, in general, locate regions of missing information. We introduce a novel algorithm for active learning and demonstrate its utility for generating smooth trajectories. Our approach is based on deep generative models and metric learning in latent spaces. It relies on the Jacobian of the likelihood to detect non-smooth transitions in the latent space, i.e., transitions that lead to abrupt changes in the movement of the robot. When non-smooth transitions are detected, our algorithm asks for an additional demonstration from that specific region. The newly acquired knowledge modifies the data manifold and allows for learning a latent representation for generating smooth movements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on generalising elementary skills, transitioning across different skills, and implicitly avoiding collisions with the environment. For our experiments, we use a simulated pendulum where we observe its motion from images and a 7-DoF anthropomorphic arm.","2153-0866","978-1-5386-8094-0","10.1109/IROS.2018.8593552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593552","","Uncertainty;Jacobian matrices;Manifolds;Data models;Measurement;Robot sensing systems","humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);pendulums","elementary skills;smooth movements;newly acquired knowledge;additional demonstration;nonsmooth transitions;latent space;metric learning;deep generative models;smooth trajectories;abrupt movements;missing information;necessary knowledge;fundamentally different skills;model sensitivity;data uncertainty;active learning","","2","","33","","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these programs are expensive, resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and reachability, leading to limited take-up and short-term impact. Digital Health Intervention (DHI) programs incorporate the use of technology - mobile, web, wearables, virtual and augmented reality - to address these limitations while being more cost-effective. DHIs have shown major success in improving physical and mental health outcomes for the general public as well as reducing adverse outcomes or high-risk groups. However, it is still very challenging and expensive to design and run high quality mobile-based DHI programs, in part due to the lack of technical skills of researchers in this field. Our proposed mobile eHealth Learning and Intervention Platform (eHeLP) aims to address these challenges with a novel approach that allows health researchers to focus on their studies, and participants to have access to multiple health programs that meet their needs. The platform caters for identified stakeholders in the DHI field and encourages the development of a new health-tech industry.

However instead of the real telemanipulator itself, a virtual environment with abstracted tasks is connected to the operator workstation.

Canal surfaces are Euclidean surfaces formed as the envelope of a family of regular surfaces (e.g. spheres) whose centers lie on a space curve. The learned skill can be reproduced, as a time-independent trajectory, and generalized to unforeseen situations inside the canal while its main characteristics are preserved. The main advantages of the proposed approach include: (a) requiring no parameter tuning, (b) maintaining the main characteristics and implicit boundaries of the skill, and (c) generalizing the learned skill over the initial condition of the movement, while exploiting the whole demonstration space to reproduce a variety of successful movements.

In the first experiment operators experienced an illusion of embodiment (in terms of body ownership and agency) for the robot's body only by imagining a movement (motor imagery) and watching the robot perform it. Also using the same setup, we could further discover that during BCI-operation of the android, biasing the timing and accuracy of the performance feedback could improve operators' modulation of brain activities for the motor imagery task. Our experiments showed that the motor imagery skills acquired through this technique were not limited to the android robot, and had long-lasting effects for other BCI usage as well. Therefore, by focusing on the human side of BCIs and demonstrating a relationship between the body ownership sensation and motor imagery learning, our BCI-teleoperation system offers a new and efficient platform for general BCI application.","","978-1-4673-7939-7","10.1109/INES.2015.7329753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7329753","","Humanoid robots;Androids;Robot sensing systems;Accuracy;Brain;Virtual reality","Android (operating system);brain-computer interfaces;humanoid robots;robots","BCI-teleoperated Androids;motor imagery learning;brain computer interface system;humanlike android;cognitive mechanism;BCI control;feedback designs;user BCI skills;BCI-operation;performance feedback;brain activities;motor imagery task;Android robot;BCI usage;body ownership sensation;motor imagery learning;BCI-teleoperation system","","5","","31","","23 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fault diagnostics is traditionally reliant on the skills and experiences of the equipment operators and maintenance engineers heavily, which creates an unnecessary technical barrier and results in extra cost in downtime cost and operation overhead. Meanwhile, there have been rich machine logs (sensory readings, performance logs, system logs, context data, process data) of the machine as well as the maintenance data and post-service reports. Such data provide an opportunity of leveraging intelligent data-driven technologies to reduce the maintenance cost through developing automated solutions on machine fault diagnostics and prognostic for critical component failures.In this paper, a data driven framework is proposed for machine diagnostics and prognostics to relieve the maintenance cost and increase the efficiency. It has been validated with real-world big data from complex vending machines. The proposed framework addresses the data size issue effectively by deriving applicable features and subsequently sustaining the top attributable ones only in the model. An accurate data labeling methodology is developed for supervised learning via comparing the serial number of target components in the adjacent dates. Two predictive models have been developed in this work whereby the first one is in the domain of binary classification for diagnostics, and the second one is a generalized two-stage prognostics model for multi-class classification for preventive maintenance. Cross-validated simulation results have shown that our developed diagnostics model can achieve above 80% accuracy in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. It has also been shown that the proposed two-stage prognostics framework can outperform the conventional one-stage multiclass prediction models.","2159-3450","978-1-5386-5457-6","10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8650152","preventive maintenance;condition-based maintenance;machine learning;fault diagnostics","Labeling;Maintenance engineering;Predictive models;Data models;IEEE Regions;Conferences;Supervised learning","Big Data;condition monitoring;data analysis;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;mechanical engineering computing;pattern classification;preventive maintenance;production equipment;remaining life assessment","downtime cost;operation overhead;rich machine logs;sensory readings;performance logs;system logs;context data;process data;maintenance data;post-service reports;intelligent data-driven technologies;maintenance cost;automated solutions;machine fault diagnostics;critical component failures;data driven framework;machine diagnostics;real-world big data;complex vending machines;data size issue;accurate data labeling methodology;target components;predictive models;two-stage prognostics model;preventive maintenance;cross-validated simulation results;developed diagnostics model;two-stage prognostics framework;one-stage multiclass prediction models;generalized predictive framework;data driven prognostics;equipment engineers;equipment operators;maintenance engineers;unnecessary technical barrier;extra cost","","","","13","","24 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We hypothesize that training reaching movements in a force field with both hands at the same time, in the same position (bimanual grip) are more beneficial in promoting transfer of the learned skill to the dominant hand than training the unimpaired limb on the same movements in the same force field since the representation of the movement should be invariant of the limb. However, unlike intermanual transfer, bimanual transfer has the potential to involve infinite number of actuator combinations, or joint configurations, interfering with consistent transfer. The efficacy of this method of transfer has implications for people with hemiparesis since the less-affected arm could potentially ""instruct"" the more-affected arm how to move. Here, we report on an experiment that evaluates and compares the skill transfer between limbs in a reaching task: 1) intermanual transfer (from the nondominant to the dominant hand) and 2) bimanual transfer (from a bimanual grip to the dominant hand) with healthy subjects. We used two methods from which to judge the transfer: performance in the presence of the force field or by errors made during ""catch trials"" when the forces were unexpectedly removed as subjects changed hands (known as after effects of adaptation). We found only a small amount of transfer (20% of that seen in the practiced limb) with both types of training, and surprisingly there was no significant difference in the movement accuracy between these two training methods. Moreover, the direction of the after effects supports the assertion that the nervous system generalizes these movements in an extrinsic coordinate system. Accordingly, the limb must experience the dynamics singularly in order to develop an internal model.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4303098","Adaptation;force field;human motor control;internal model","Nervous system;Actuators;Humans;Motor drives;Heart;Research and development;Laboratories;Brain injuries;Neuroplasticity;Couplings","biomechanics","joint configuration;actuator combination;bimanual grip;reaching movements;intermanual transfer;contralateral bimanual limb training;single limb performance","Adaptation, Physiological;Computer Simulation;Functional Laterality;Hand Strength;Humans;Learning;Models, Biological;Motor Skills;Movement;Task Performance and Analysis;Upper Extremity","21","","34","","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because FRA relies on graphical analysis, interpretation of its signature is a very specialized area that calls for skilled personnel, as so far, there is no reliable standard code for FRA signature identification and quantification. Many researchers investigated the impact of various mechanical winding deformations on the transformer FRA signature using simulation analysis by altering particular electrical parameters of the transformer equivalent electrical circuit. None of them however, investigated the impact of various physical fault levels on the corresponding change in the equivalent circuit parameters. In this paper, the physical geometrical dimension of a single-phase transformer is simulated using 3D finite element analysis to emulate the real transformer operation. A physical axial displacement of different fault levels is simulated in both low voltage and high voltage windings. The impact of each fault level on the electrical parameters of the equivalent circuit is investigated. A key contribution of this paper is the charts it introduces to correlate various axial displacement levels with the percentage change of all transformer equivalent circuit parameters due to the axial displacement fault. In contrary with other researchers who only considered mutual inductance between low voltage and high voltage windings, simulation results shown in this paper reveal that other circuit parameters should be changed by a particular percentage to accurately simulate particular fault level of transformer winding axial displacement. Results of this paper aid to precisely simulating winding axial displacement using transformer equivalent circuit that facilitates accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of transformer FRA signatures.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2014.004591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033429","Power transformer;condition monitoring;FRA;axial faults;insulator winding integrity diagnostics","Windings;Circuit faults;Power transformer insulation;Capacitance;Inductance;Finite element analysis","deformation;equivalent circuits;fault diagnosis;finite element analysis;frequency response;power transformers;transformer windings","power transformer winding fault detection;frequency response analysis;FRA diagnostics;FRA test equipment;graphical analysis;mechanical winding deformations;transformer FRA signature;equivalent electrical circuit;physical geometrical dimension;single-phase transformer;3D finite element analysis;low voltage winding;high voltage winding;mutual inductance;winding axial displacement;quantitative analysis","","95","","37","","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Four participants performed the task by hand (using a manual needle driver instrument) and by using a surgical robot, with or without vibrotactile feedback. The vibrotactile feedback signal indicated the deviation in force direction, with the signal amplitude modulated by the force magnitude. Visual feedback was always available in all experimental conditions. The participants' task was to insert a hooked needle into a simulated tissue pad at a pre- marked entrance point and drive it out of the tissue pad at a corresponding pre-marked exit point. The participants were instructed to hold the hooked needle in an orientation that minimized side-loading on the simulated tissue pad and prevented needle rotation in the needle driver. The forces exerted by the needle on the simulated tissue pad were recorded. The results indicated that the vibrotactile display was useful in reducing the overall force-direction deviation during the needle-insertion task, but it increased task completion time. It generally took twice as long to perform the task with the robot than with the hand. One participant who was experienced with the surgical robot consistently applied less force with the robot than with the hand. The vibrotactile feedback reduced the magnitude of the force component that was perpendicular to the suturing surface, but not the forces along the suturing surface. We compare our results to those reported in the literature and discuss the challenges we faced in assessing haptic feedback in a skilled surgical task such as the one used in the present study.","2324-7355","978-1-4244-2005-6","10.1109/HAPTICS.2008.4479920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479920","Surgical robot;surgical simulation;vibrotactile feedback;evaluation;needle-insertion task;H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces ¿ Haptic I/O;H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems ¿ Human factors","Medical robotics;Needles;Surgery;Force feedback;Haptic interfaces;Laboratories;Robot sensing systems;Surgical instruments;Visualization;Hospitals","feedback;medical robotics;surgery","vibrotactile feedback assessment;needle-insertion task;surgical robot;force direction;signal amplitude;force magnitude;visual feedback;pre-marked entrance point;vibrotactile display;force-direction deviation;suturing surface","","7","","24","","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, several methods for measuring the tactile sensitivity are clinically used in diabetic peripheral neuropathy screening. One of these methods is a touch test that uses a device with nylon SWMs, i.e., SWMs embedded in a plastic handle. A small pushing force is applied at the handle to bow the filaments. Because of its ease and simplicity, the SWM test is conducted at the patient's bedside in a hospital. However, previous studies have reported some problems with this test. Studies have shown variations in the measured data, and it is uncertain whether these variations are caused by mechanical properties of the nylon fiber or by the motion of the operator's hands. We carried out two experiments to examine the effect of (1) the variability caused by the human operator conducting the SWM test on the test results and (2) the number of compressions of the SWM on the test results. In experiment 1, we measured the velocity of the operator's hand motion and the buckling force of the SWMs. The results showed variability in the hand motion of the operator conducting the SWM tests. In experiment 2, we measured the buckling force of the SWMs under a controlled velocity. We compared the buckling force of the SWMs through a number of trials. These results showed that the buckling force gradually decreases as the number of test cycles increase. In conclusion, we find that the accuracy of the SWM tests is a factor of the number of test cycles. Additionally, manual training for standardizing skills of medical staff members needs to be developed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the SWMs deteriorated over time. In future work, we aimto find a solution to minimize the variability in the SWM test results and develop a new testing system that uses tactile sensibility for diabetic peripheral neuropathy screening.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318596","","Force;Diabetes;Force measurement;Medical diagnostic imaging;Testing;Motion measurement;Correlation coefficient","biomedical measurement;force measurement;medical disorders;touch (physiological);velocity measurement","tactile sensory test;tactile sensitivity measurement;diabetic peripheral neuropathy screening;touch test;nylon Semmes-Weinstein monofilament;plastic handle;pushing force;patient bedside;hospital;mechanical properties;nylon fiber;operator hand motion;velocity measurement;buckling force measurement;medical staff members","Hand;Humans;Pressure;Sensory Thresholds;Touch","","","14","","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this problem, authors present a novel technique that allows developers to create remote labs in a quick, didactical, and straightforward way. This framework is based on the use of two well-known software tools in the scope of engineering education, Easy Java Simulations and LabVIEW.

Particularly, the EJS element here presented allows to LabVIEW programs be controlled from EJS applications through a communication network.

In general, however, it is not easy to put RL into practical use. This difficulty includes a problem of designing a suitable action space of an agent, i.e., satisfying two requirements in trade-off: (i) to keep the characteristics (or structure) of an original search space as much as possible in order to seek strategies that lie close to the optimal, and (ii) to reduce the search space as much as possible in order to expedite the learning process. In order to design a suitable action space adaptively, we have proposed switching RL model to mimic a process of an infant's motor development in which gross motor skills develop before fine motor skills. Then, a method for switching controllers is constructed by introducing and referring to the ""entropy"". Further, through a computational experiment by using a robot navigation problem with two-dimensional continuous action space, the validity and the potential of the proposed method have been confirmed.","","978-4-907764-36-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5604249","reinforcement learning;action space design;entropy;simulation","Switches;Aerospace electronics;Learning;Entropy;Computational modeling;Robots","humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots","reinforcement learning;infant motor development mimicking;two-dimensional continuous action space;computational intelligence;switching RL model;gross motor skills;fine motor skills;switching controllers;robot navigation problem","","","","8","","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the robot has to push a ball into a soccer net without any knowledge of the environment and its own location. In addition, our further goal was to perform agent validation during training and assess its generalization level. Despite the many advances in reinforcement learning, it is still a challenge.

While restoration of certain degree of proximal and global movements and function is expected, the recovery of premorbid hand mobility and dexterity is less likely to occur. Although great efforts are usually made to rehabilitate these skills, with customized particular and analytic exercises, their assessment is rarely made with the same level of specificity. In general, hand and finger mobility and functionality are indirectly assessed in the clinic with standardized clinical scales and tests that require the use of these skills to perform some tasks. Although these scales are easy to administer, they can present poor accuracy, be biased, and do not allow for isolated assessment of joints and movements. Multi-touch technology enables interaction with electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with on-screen finger touches. Although there is a very limited number of studies that investigate the potential of this technology to rehabilitate hand mobility and dexterity, the use of this technology for assessment of these skills remains unexplored. This study evaluates the feasibility of a multi-touch-based assessment tool (app) of hand mobility and dexterity in a sample of post-stroke survivors. Our results provide preliminary evidence that this technology can be used to design valid and reliable instruments for assessing hand mobility and dexterity that, in addition, are sensitive to the severity of the motor impairment of the upper limb after stroke, which could complement conventional clinical assessment.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994584","hand mobility;hand dexterity;assessment;stroke;validity;upper limb;tablet;multi-touch technology;app","Thumb;Tools;Instruments;Reliability;Stroke (medical condition);Performance evaluation","biomechanics;diseases;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;touch sensitive screens","post-stroke survivors;conventional clinical assessment;multitouch-based assessment tool;on-screen finger touches;multitouch technology;isolated assessment;standardized clinical scales;finger mobility;analytic exercises;customized particular exercises;premorbid hand mobility;global movements;proximal movements;occupational therapy interventions;physical therapy interventions;upper limb function;upper limb impairment severity;hand dexterity","","","","16","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.04TH8753)","3 Sep 2004","2004","2","","1602","1609 Vol.2","A simulated model of plant growth and evolution was studied. Plants start out as seeds on a 2D grid. Plant genomes are modeled as instructions telling a plant where to grow and where to place seeds. Energy is gained by occupying grid space in analogy to collection of light by leaf surface area. At the end of a generation, cells currently occupied by plants are cleared and the seeds dropped by all the plants sprout to become the new plants. Each seed produced has a probability of mutation to the genome it contains. The simulated plants evolve to play a game of competitive exclusion, in which grid space is a limited resource. This work tested the hypothesis that the evolved plants would display nonlocal adaptation, i.e. that the plants would not only adapt to their local environment, but would acquire general skill that would enable them to grow competitively against plants that were never a part of their environment. Statistical tests show that populations of plants that have evolved for a larger number of generations are able to occupy more grid space when played against populations of plants evolved for a shorter time. This occurs even if the two competing populations come from entirely different lineages. This improvement in competitive ability continues over the course of the evolution performed in this study, without appearing to reach an equilibrium after which further evolution fails to improve the plants. This suggests that the plants are continually discovering generally useful strategies, rather than adapting only to their local environment.","","0-7803-8515-2","10.1109/CEC.2004.1331087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331087","","Organisms;Evolution (biology);Biological system modeling;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Testing;Computer science;Computational biology;Computational modeling;Computer simulation","evolutionary computation;living systems;adaptive systems;evolution (biological)","nonlocal evolutionary adaptation;gridplants;plant growth simulated model;evolution simulated model;2D grid;plant genomes;grid space;competitive exclusion;statistical tests","","11","","8","","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Relying on visual, audio and haptic cues, it is a difficult skill to master and with the availability of various new diagnostic techniques, the emphasis on cardiac auscultation is decreasing in both education and practice settings. Traditional cardiac auscultation training is focused on memorizing various heart sounds and their corresponding diagnosis. Recent hardware and computational advancements are providing the opportunity to develop virtual-based medical simulations that employ a high level of fidelity and novel user-simulation interaction techniques using off-the-shelf consumer-level hardware and devices. However, these virtual applications are generally restricted to cognitive skills training given that the simulation of accurate haptic cues required to replicate the sense of touch (an important component of many medical procedures including cardiac auscultation), is still difficult and cost-prohibitive. Although several low fidelity and low-cost gaming-based haptic devices are currently available, they are generally restrictive and cannot provide the range of motions (degrees of freedom) required to simulate many medical procedures. Here we describe an approach to add rotational degrees of freedom to the Novint Falcon, a consumer level (gaming) haptics device, by coupling a smartphone and incorporating the smartphone's accelerometer data to the haptics virtual controller. Our goal is to overcome the limitations associated with the limited degrees of freedom available on consumer level haptic devices and permit their use in medical technical skills-based simulation training with an affordable approach.","","978-1-5090-3429-1","10.1109/IISA.2016.7785431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785431","","Haptic interfaces;Training;Solid modeling;Medical diagnostic imaging;Visualization;Games;Surgery","accelerometers;cardiology;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;patient diagnosis;smart phones","low-end haptic device;rotational DOF;virtual cardiac auscultation training;heart sounds;virtual-based medical simulations;user-simulation interaction techniques;low-cost gaming-based haptic devices;medical procedures;smartphone accelerometer data;haptics virtual controller;consumer level haptic devices","","1","","28","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the need for the primary health care physicians to improve the cardiac auscultation skill is still very strong in the primary screening examination, and becomes stronger for the general users to perform the auscultation at home. The objective of this paper presents the novel detection method for heart defects using the cardiac sound characteristic waveform (CSCW) with data clustering technique. An analytical model based on a mass-spring-damper system is proposed for extracting the CSCW from the sound signals. Feature sets T1, T2, T1T1 and T1T2 induced from the time elapses of the first heart sound and second heart sound with a passive threshold value (THV) are, also, introduced to detect heart abnormalities. Further, data clustering technique will be introduced to determinate an adaptive and reliable THV ranges. The cost function, e.g., Jm, and two cluster centers, e.g., (c11, c12) and (c21, c22), of the feature sets are also used to identify normal and abnormal heart sounds automatically. The feature sets were verified useful for identification of normal and abnormal heart sounds. The easy-understanding graphical screening ways of the features was considered, in advance, even for an inexperienced user able to monitor his or her pathology progress. Furthermore, for clustering results, the minimized cost function and cluster centers could be also efficient indicators for identifying the heart defects. Finally, a case study on the normal heart sound and abnormal heart sound was demonstrated to validate the usefulness and efficiency of CSCW with clustering algorithm. Particularly, the normal cases had very small value. For abnormal cases, in case of aortic regurgitation, its Jm was very small and the values of the centers were very high comparing to the normal cases.","","978-89-950038-6-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2007.4406624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406624","Cardiovascular abnormality detection;Cardiac sound characteristic waveform (CSCW);Data clustering technique;First and second heart sounds","Cardiology;Heart;Cost function;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Medical services;Analytical models;Data mining;Monitoring;Pathology","biomedical ultrasonics;cardiology;diseases;pattern clustering","cardiovascular abnormality detection;cardiac sound characteristic waveform;data clustering technique;life-style related diseases;health care;cardiac auscultation skill;primary screening examination;mass-spring-damper system;passive threshold value;heart abnormalities detection;minimized cost function","","","","10","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

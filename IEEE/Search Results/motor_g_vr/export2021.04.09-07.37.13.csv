"Virtual reality as a complex interactive system: a multidimensional model of person artificial partner co-relations","A. Libin","Dept. of Psychol., Georgetown Univ., Rockville, MD, USA","Proceedings Seventh International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia","6 Aug 2002","2001","","","652","657","The operational definition of virtual reality as a complex interactive system (CIS) represents it as a configuration of exchanges between a person and a digital world mediated by the artificial, partner. The adequate model for understanding the essence of CIS includes, in addition to three 'traditional' dimensions (physical-per-se, mental, and virtual), a fourth dimension defined as individual self-determination and formed by one's needs, preferences, profile of imagination, identities, and individual experiences. The analysis of 'person-artificial agent' interactions in the context of a complex systems approach is associated with the implementation of such interaction effects as compensation, optimization, adequacy, and effectiveness. Virtual entertainment can be viewed not only as a part of modern popular culture but also as a tool for constructive activities. The latter, employed by certain groups of users, can not only enhance their life as an enjoyment but also as training tool for sensory-motor, cognitive and emotional improvement, and their well-being in general.","","0-7695-1402-2","10.1109/VSMM.2001.969724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969724","","Virtual reality;Interactive systems;Multidimensional systems;Computational Intelligence Society;Humans;Visual perception;Cultural differences;Search engines;Psychology;Aging","virtual reality;man-machine systems;software agents;computer games;interactive systems","complex interactive system;virtual reality;artificial agent;individual preferences;man machine interactions;computer game","","4","","30","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This increases the risk of colon injury to the patient and lengthens the procedure time. Since a decade ago, there has been research on virtual reality surgery simulators with haptic feedback. The main goal is to provide an alternative to traditional training methods on animals, cadavers or real patients. Haptic feedback is a key feature for every surgery simulator for the training of hand-eye coordination. In this paper, a compact and portable haptic interface is presented for the colonoscopy. The haptic interface provides position data acquisition and force feedback in linear and rotational directions with combined electrical motors and passive brakes to cover a large range of forces. The motorized drives are used for active force feedback and friction compensation and the brakes are used for high force rendering without slipping. This novel design allows decoupled motion in both directions.","2324-7355","978-1-4244-2005-6","10.1109/HAPTICS.2008.4479998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479998","B.0 [Hardware]: General¿Surgery Simulators;I.6.3 [Computing Methodologies]: Simulation and Modeling¿Applications","Haptic interfaces;Colonoscopy;Force feedback;Colon;Surgery;Medical treatment;Injuries;Virtual reality;Animals;Cadaver","DC motors;digital simulation;force feedback;haptic interfaces;patient treatment;virtual reality","haptic interface;colonoscopy simulation;colon treatment;brake system;electrical motor system;virtual reality surgery simulator;haptic force feedback;data acquisition;friction compensation;force rendering;hand-eye coordination training","","11","2","9","","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The platform under development, an augmented reality system combined with a haptic-interface robot, will be a new tool for contributing to the scientific knowledge base in the area of human movement control and rehabilitation robotics.

Hardware advancements have enabled replication of real-world interactions in virtual environments to a large extent, paving the way for commercial grade applications that provide a safe and risk-free training environment at a fraction of the cost. But this also mandates the need to develop more intrinsic interaction techniques and to empirically evaluate them in a more comprehensive manner. Although there exists a body of previous research that examines the benefits of selected levels of interaction fidelity on performance, few studies have investigated the constituent components of fidelity in a Interaction Fidelity Continuum (IFC) with several system instances and their respective effects on performance and learning in the context of a real-world skills training application. Our work describes a large between-subjects investigation conducted over several years that utilizes bimanual interaction metaphors at six discrete levels of interaction fidelity to teach basic precision metrology concepts in a near-field spatial interaction task in VR. A combined analysis performed on the data compares and contrasts the six different conditions and their overall effects on performance and learning outcomes, eliciting patterns in the results between the discrete application points on the IFC. With respect to some performance variables, results indicate that simpler restrictive interaction metaphors and highest fidelity metaphors perform better than medium fidelity interaction metaphors. In light of these results, a set of general guidelines are created for developers of spatial interaction metaphors in immersive virtual environments for precise fine-motor skills training simulations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794639","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260967","Bimanual Interaction;Interaction Fidelity;Empirical Evaluation;Educational Virtual Reality","Training;Aerospace electronics;Solid modeling;Metrology;Mice;Virtual environments","computer based training;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","Interaction Fidelity Continuum;near-field training simulations;virtual reality applications;education;real-world interactions;safe risk-free training environment;intrinsic interaction techniques;near-field spatial interaction task;learning outcomes;discrete application points;performance variables;medium fidelity interaction metaphors;spatial interaction metaphors;immersive virtual environments;fine-motor skills training simulations;bimanual interaction metaphors;restrictive interaction metaphors;head-mounted displays;tracking technology","Adolescent;Adult;Cognition;Female;High Fidelity Simulation Training;Humans;Male;Surveys and Questionnaires;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","1","","33","Traditional","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We investigated it by means of a wrist robot coupled with a virtual reality system: kinesthetic and visual disturbances were applied during a tracking task, in a unimodal and bimodal manner, and we observed the performance. Tracking involved two degrees of freedom and the kinesthetic disturbance was applied by the robot through the third degree of freedom. Visual disturbance was provided by rotating the visual feedback. The results suggest that the combination of a suitable proprioceptive feedback with the kinematic redundancy of the HCI system might be a rather general principle for improving the efficiency of HCI systems.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-3788-7","10.1109/ICORR.2009.5209541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209541","wrist robot;visual and proprioceptive disturbance;visuo-manual tracking;virtual reality","Target tracking;Human computer interaction;Robot kinematics;Motor drives;Mice;Wrist;Virtual reality;Feedback;Brushes;Minimally invasive surgery","robots;user interfaces;virtual reality","tracking target motion;visual disturbances;kinesthetic disturbances;human-computer interface;hand-eye coordination task;wrist robot;virtual reality system;proprioceptive feedback","","","","14","","21 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The mental events occurred while responding to certain stimuli is called mental chronometry in experimental psychology. A subtractive method by subtracting the time required by various task performance experiments has been suggested to be the easiest way to analyse mental chronometry. While ethnic differences in task performance have been widely reported, the mental chronometry study involving Indonesian subjects is very limited. Therefore in this study we describe the process of mental chronometry in simulated driving tasks among Indonesian subjects. We performed two experiments, the first was to measure the reaction time to three visual display indicators in the form of analogue, digital and hybrid design, and the second was to measure the driving performance in brake and lane change task during fatigue and non-fatigue condition. In all of the experiments, the reaction time is the dependent variable measured. The analogue design was found to produce longer reaction time than both digital and hybrid design. In general, both brake and lane change reaction time produced longer reaction time than display indicator reaction time. Fatigue was found to lengthen reaction time during driving. Lane change reaction task as the most complicated task, affected by fatigue greater than brake reaction task. In general, fatigue lengthens reaction time greater in the more complex task. Thus, in order to prevent traffic accident, it is necessary to simplify the complicated tasks by making better system and environment design as well as the application of driving assistance system. Future studies using physical and physiological measurement methods involving larger number of subjects is necessary.","","978-1-5386-0510-3","10.1109/ICACOMIT.2017.8253376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8253376","reaction time/response time;fatigue;visual task;driving simulator;driving safety","Time measurement;Fatigue;Visualization;Brakes;Time factors;Extraterrestrial measurements","chronometers;human factors;psychology;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","simulated driving tasks;Indonesian subjects;driving performance studies;task performance experiments;lane change task;fatigue;lane change reaction time;display indicator reaction time;lane change reaction task;brake reaction task;mental chronometry;mental events;experimental psychology;ethnic differences;task performance","","3","","31","","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional methods are used generally for the rehabilitation of this disorder and studies are currently trying to rehabilitate patients through interaction with serious video games focused on health. This study proposes a combination of the two methods to find improvements in the flexion angle of shoulder affected by upper motor neurone lesion in patients of the “Clinica de Dolor del Eje Cafetero”. Methodology - 6 patients (3 patients with sequels of stroke, 1 patient with sequels of TBI and 2 patients with sequels of cerebral palsy) were taken into consideration. All patients suffered monoparesia in upper limb. Each patient had 7 sessions of rehabilitation. Each session of rehabilitation lasted for 30 minutes of assisted therapy and another 30 minutes with therapies of VR, where the movements of flexion of the shoulder affected through the Kinect sensor were recorded while the patient interacted with the video game. A biomechanical analysis with the Bio-Cirac software developed to load data from MoCap and show angle graphs was performed. Results - the patient who achieved the best results showed 21.0 % of improvement in the angle of flexion of the affected shoulder and improvement in muscular endurance and control of their affected limb. Conclusion - VR and serious video games specifically designed for particular pathologies are potentially useful technologies that can be combined with conventional methods to improve the angle of amplitude of flexion of the shoulder affected in patients with sequels of upper motor neurone lesion. In addition VR offers immersive experiences favorable for dissipation of pain, fatigue, setting goals and enjoyment of the activity.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067072","pyramidal syndrome;Kinect;Rehabilitation;Exergame;Serious Game","Games;Medical treatment;Lesions;Neurons;Virtual reality;Pain;Muscles","biomechanics;interactive devices;medical computing;medical disorders;patient rehabilitation;serious games (computing);virtual reality","shoulder flexion rehabilitation;patient rehabilitation;monoparesia;exergame;serious video game;pyramidal syndrome;neuromotor disorder;Kinect sensor;biomechanical analysis;Bio-Cirac software;VR;virtual reality","","1","","19","","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, while video game play, EEG was recorded for 20 minutes. Analysis was made based on comparison between activation EEG data during game play and the baseline. EEG data was acquired using 19-channel EEG machine. The data was pre-processed to remove artifacts like eye blinking, eye movement and drowsiness. We used three EEG measures: absolute power, coherence and phase lag to analyse further analysed the data. The data were divided into four frequency bands. In general, beta band is associated with learning and making responses. In beta band (12-25 Hz), it was found that the absolute power was higher in occipital, parietal frontal and motor regions while playing video game as compared to sitting idly. For coherence, it was seen that the above mentioned regions were highly coherent in beta indicating connectivity between the regions.

However, when developing tools for rehabilitation, it is essential to design interventions that will be most effective for generalizing to the real world. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors facilitate transfer from HMD-VR to non-HMD-VR environments. Here we used a well-established test of skilled motor learning, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), to train healthy individuals in an HMD-VR environment. We examined whether learned motor skills transferred to a more conventional (non-HMD-VR) environment and what factors facilitated transfer. Our results suggest that on average, learned motor skills from this task transfer from an immersive virtual environment to a conventional environment; however, some individuals did not transfer the learned motor skills. We then examined individual differences between those that did show transfer and those that did not. We found that individuals who had previous exposure to HMD-VR were more likely to transfer their learned motor skills than those who did not. Individual differences in previous exposure to HMD-VR environments prior to training may serve as a predictor to whether learned motor skills will transfer out of HMD-VR.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994345","head-mounted virtual reality;skilled motor learning;transfer","","biomechanics;helmet mounted displays;learning (artificial intelligence);patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","HMD-VR environment;learned motor skills;head-mounted virtual reality;HMD-VR motor skills;motor rehabilitation;nonHMD-VR environments;skilled motor learning;immersive virtual environment","","","","9","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although many patients regain most reach and grasp capabilities in their upper extremity function, recovery of the pinch skill remains incomplete for the majority of patients. In this study, an innovative VR-based pinch skill training and strengthening system using haptics simulation was developed for the long-term recovery of upper extremity motor function post stroke. Two subject tests were conducted. The first was a healthy subject test conducted with 30 participants to verify the system design and functionality, specifically emphasizing difficulty levels and behavior phases. The second was a pilot test conducted on two stroke patients to examine the feasibility and therapeutic effects of the proposed system. Upon completion of the pilot test, the results of clinical assessment showed that both participants were improved. Using synchronized kinematic and kinetic data, the participants' behavior time-history was reconstructed for behavior interpretation and motor activity analysis. Finally, user acceptance of the technology was high, indicating that the participants intended to continue using the proposed system for rehabilitation.","","978-1-5386-1431-0","10.1109/INCIT.2017.8257885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257885","haptics;pinch;stroke;upper extremity;virtual reality (VR) therapy;rehabilitation","Force;Thumb;Haptic interfaces;Training;Information technology","biomechanics;haptic interfaces;medical computing;medical disorders;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","innovative VR-based pinch skill training;haptics simulation;stroke patients;virtual reality;stroke rehabilitation;haptic feedback;pinch simulation;motor activity analysis","","1","","18","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For reaching movements, the Kalman filter typically estimates the instantaneous endpoint velocity of the control device. Here, we analyzed attempted arm/hand movements by people with tetraplegia to control a cursor on a computer screen to reach several circular targets. A standard velocity Kalman filter is enhanced to additionally decode for the cursor's position. We then mix decoded velocity and position to generate cursor movement commands. We analyzed data, offline, from two participants across six sessions. Root mean squared error between the actual and estimated cursor trajectory improved by 12.2 ±10.5% (pairwise t-test, p<;0.05) as compared to a standard velocity Kalman filter.

However, the patient must be properly motivated to actively participate in therapy. Several strategies have been suggested to improve patient motivation, but one element has not yet been explored: playing with other people. We designed a two-player rehabilitation game played by two people using two ARMin III robots. We tested three game modes: single-player (competing against a computer), competitive (competing against a human), and cooperative (cooperating with a human against a computer). All modes were played by 24 healthy subjects who filled out questionnaires about their personality and in-game motivation. Almost all subjects preferred playing the two-player game modes to the single-player one, as they enjoyed being able to talk and interact with another person. However, there were two distinct player groups. One group liked the competitive mode but not the cooperative mode while the other liked the cooperative but not the competitive mode. Subjects who liked the competitive mode also put more effort into it. Finally, subjects' personalities partially predicted what mode they would like. This emphasizes that two-player rehabilitation games have advantages over single-player ones, but that the right game needs to be chosen for each subject.

Three serious games for upper limb motor function and cognitive training were developed in which patients move their arms to touch virtual targets generated in the three-dimensional AR environment. Patients received visual and vibration feedback after successfully touching each target. Eight stroke patients with upper limb dysfunction performed pilot validation testing with the cellphone AR system. Motor function performance was evaluated based on performance in the AR games and mental state was evaluated via questionnaires self-reporting various aspects of mental state. Results showed that motor performance improved by the last trial as compared to the first trial (p<;0.05). In addition, the majority of patients reported that they felt `relaxed' and `happy' while playing the AR rehabilitation games.

Instead of stiffness-damping plots, we believe a more illustrative technique for plotting the Z-width of a haptic interface is the envelope of achievable passive impedances as a function of frequency. Both hardware and analysis software for this new type of Z-width measurement are discussed. 	As previous research has shown, the maximum passive impedance that a device can render is directly related to the physical damping available in the mechanism. In an effort to maximize the Z-width of the haptic display, we present a new technique for adding physical damping to a haptic display through the use of analog electronics in the motor amplifier. Due to its electrical nature, active electrical damping has the benefit of dynamically variable parameters with no added mechanical complexity or mass.

Statistical methods, however, require the availability of sufficiently large data sets. As a result, experimental paradigms used to collect behavioral trials from individuals are data centered and not user centered. This means that experimental paradigms are tuned to collect as many trials as possible, are generally rather demanding, and are not always motivating or engaging for individuals. Subject cooperation and their compliance with the task may decrease over time. Whenever possible, paradigms are designed to control for factors such as fatigue, attention, and motivation. In this paper, we propose the use of the Kinect motion tracking sensor (Microsoft, Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) in a game-based paradigm for noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based functional motor mapping. Results from an experimental study with able-bodied subjects playing a virtual ball game suggest that the Kinect sensor is useful for isolating specific movements during the interaction with the game, and that the computed EEG patterns for hand and feet movements are in agreement with results described in the literature.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2250287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472046","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);functional brain mapping;motion tracking;serious games","Electroencephalography;Games;Tracking;Brain mapping;Brain;Joints;Monitoring","behavioural sciences;computer games;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;statistical analysis;virtual reality","computer games;noninvasive EEG-based functional brain mapping;statistical models;statistical inference;brain structures;human behavior;neuroscience;statistical methods;behavioral trials;data centered trials;user centered trialsv;experimental paradigms;Kinect motion tracking sensor;game-based paradigm;noninvasive electroencephalogram-based functional motor mapping;EEG-based functional motor mapping;able-bodied subjects;virtual ball game;Kinect sensor;computed EEG patterns;hand movement;feet movement","","17","","35","","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sixteen young healthy right- handed subjects (eight female and eight male) were asked to grip and lift the object using the dominant and non-dominant hand separately, and they did not know where the weight was located on the object. During lifting and holding periods, subjects should keep the object stable as far as possible to reduce rotation and tilt. The object peak roll and time interval of compensatory moment increased to 50 N·mm were calculated and quantified to analyze the motor adaptation of both hands. The statistical results had shown with the trial course, both peak roll and time interval had significantly decreased, especially between the first and second trial, indicating reinforced feed-forward and feedback control. However, there was no significant difference between the dominant and the non-dominant hands. These results had revealed the dominant hand was not superior to the non-dominant hand in the motor adaptation including accurate force or torque modulation during unfamiliar object manipulation. In a certain degree, it suggested that non-skilled motor adaptation tasks under visual feedback had no differences between both hands. In addition, generally, with more than two or three practices, subjects could have a better manipulation of unfamiliar objects with correct feed-forward and proper feedback control.","2164-5221","978-1-5386-4673-1","10.1109/ICSP.2018.8652435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8652435","precision grip;asymmetrical mass;motor control;motor adaptation;handedness","Force;Thumb;Task analysis;Torque;Visualization;Indexes","biomechanics;feedback;force control;manipulators;statistical analysis;virtual reality","asymmetrical mass object manipulations;nondominant precision grip;asymmetric performances;nonuniform weight-distribution object;lifting;object peak roll;dominant hand;nonskilled motor adaptation tasks","","","","14","","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These conditions may vary with respect to the number of electrodes, the time and effort that can be invested by the user for training/calibrating the system prior to its use, as well as the duration or even the type of the imaginary task that is most convenient for the user. Hence, it is desirable to design classification schemes that are not only accurate in terms of the classification output but also robust to changes in the operational conditions. Towards this goal, we propose a new sparse representation classification scheme that extends current sparse representation schemes by exploiting the group sparsity of relevant features. Based on this scheme each test signal is represented as a linear combination of train trials that are further constrained to belong in the same MI class. Our expectation is that this constrained linear combination exploiting the grouping structure of the training data will lead to representations that are more robust to varying operational conditions. Moreover, in order to avoid overfitting and provide a model with good generalization abilities we adopt the bayesian framework and, in particular, the Variational Bayesian Framework since we use a specific approximate posterior to exploit the grouping structure of the data. We have evaluated the proposed algorithm on two MI datasets using electroencephalograms (EEG) that allowed us to simulate different operational conditions like the number of available channels, the number of training trials, the type of MI tasks, as well as the duration of each trial. Results have shown that the proposed method presents state-of-the-art performance against well known classification methods in MI BCI literature.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997116","Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (JU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099226","Motor imagery;sparse representation classification;group sparsity;collaborative representation classification","Electroencephalography;Training;Task analysis;Robustness;Brain modeling;Bayes methods;Information technology","Bayes methods;bioelectric potentials;brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;signal classification;signal representation","grouping structure;brain computer interfaces;sparse representation classification scheme;group sparsity;constrained linear combination;MI BCI literature;variational Bayesian framework;robust motor imagery classification;electroencephalograms","","","","34","CCBY","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new motion-sensing technology, Kinect, is cost effective and does not require the patient to wear sensors on the body, which increases freedom of movement. The objective of this study was to use Kinect technology to develop a VR stroke rehabilitation system with unilateral and bilateral tasks for recovering the function of the upper extremity. This study tested the feasibility, therapeutic effectiveness, and user acceptance of this technology. Two participants with various levels of motor severity received 30-minute stroke rehabilitation 3 times per week over 8 weeks (a total 24 training sessions). The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Test Évaluant la performance des Membres supérieurs des Personnes Âgées (TEMPA), and Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance (FMA) were used to collect data before and after rehabilitation, and during a follow-up to detect the changes of functional performance. Questionnaires of user acceptance of the technology were administered. On completion of the rehabilitation program, using the proposed Kinect-based VR training system, WMFT, TEMPA, and FMA results increased for both participants. The technology acceptance questionnaires indicated that participants had strong intentions to continue using the proposed system for rehabilitation. We developed the first Kinect-based stroke rehabilitation for the upper extremity, and demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness in improving upper extremity function after a stroke. A large-scale study should be conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed system for stroke rehabilitation.","","978-1-7281-2820-7","10.1109/Ubi-Media.2019.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049601","Stroke, upper extremity, effectiveness, virtual-reality therapy","Task analysis;Stroke (medical condition);Extremities;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Medical treatment;Atmospheric measurements","image motion analysis;medical disorders;medical image processing;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","physical performance;rehabilitation program;Kinect-based VR training system;Kinect-based stroke rehabilitation;upper extremity function;Kinect-based system;virtual reality-based stroke rehabilitation;stroke patients;motion-sensing technology;Kinect technology;VR stroke rehabilitation system;bilateral tasks;motor severity;stroke rehabilitation;Wolf Motor Function Test;Test Evaluant la performance des Membres superieurs des Personnes Agees;time 8.0 week","","","","16","","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an incremental adaptive EEG classification scheme. In this scheme, an extended sequential adaptive fuzzy inference system (ESAFIS) is used to evolve its structure dynamically and adapts the classifier automatically online to address the non-stationarity of the EEG signals. ESAFIS is an evolving system, wherein the fuzzy rules are evolved based on the modified influence of the rule. This paper presents the classification of 2-class motor imagery EEG based on ESAFIS with adaptive strategy. Simulations are conducted based on two datasets: one is the BCI Competition IV dataset 2b and the other one is recorded from our own BCI experiments.

The first task is to move the cursor to a target on the monitor screen (termed a 2-D cursor movement), and the second task is either to select a target of interest by clicking on it or to reject a target that is not of interest by not clicking on it. In a previous study, we implemented the former function in an EEG-based brain-computer interface system using motor imagery and the P300 potential to control the horizontal and vertical cursor movements, respectively. In this study, the target selection or rejection functionality is implemented using a hybrid feature from motor imagery and the P300 potential. Specifically, to select the target of interest, the user must focus his or her attention on a flashing button to evoke the P300 potential, while simultaneously maintaining an idle state of motor imagery. Otherwise, the user performs left-/right-hand motor imagery without paying attention to any buttons to reject the target. Our data analysis and online experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed hybrid feature is shown to be more effective than the use of either the motor imagery feature or the P300 feature alone. Eleven subjects attended our online experiment, in which a trial involved sequential 2-D cursor movement and target selection.

However, there is a much larger population of patients with some residual motor function as well as the general population of able-bodied individuals, both of whom could benefit significantly from BCIs. An important question that has yet to be systematically studied is: can subjects use BCIs simultaneously with overt motor activity? We present results from a preliminary study aimed at exploring this question. Three subjects used hand motor imagery in an electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI while simultaneously using a joystick to control a cursor. Particular attention was paid to preventing potential muscle artifacts from influencing imagery-based control. All three subjects were able to use the hybrid “imagery+joystick” mode of control over two days, demonstrating the ability to learn and significantly improve performance. These results suggest that subjects can potentially augment their normal human sensorimotor capability by exercising direct brain control over devices concurrently with overt motor control.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347535","","Electroencephalography;Human factors;Brain computer interfaces;Electromyography;Muscles;Electrodes;Training","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;handicapped aids;muscle","brain-computer interfacing;motor control;noninvasive BCI;paralyzed individuals;locked-in individuals;residual motor function;electroencephalographic BCI;EEG BCI;joystick;muscle artifact","Adult;Brain;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Humans;Imagery (Psychotherapy);Learning;Male;Motor Skills;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors;Young Adult","1","","9","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out comparing the BBT and VR-BBT assessments. The test-retest reliability was also explored for the scores gathered with the virtual tool. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the game-like system correlated with the validated measures of the physical BBT, with a strong test-retest reliability.

Two of the earliest indicators of potential neurocognitive problems are motor and visual dysfunction. Motor disorders and problems in visual cognition can be seen in many neurocognitive disorders, resulting in abnormal physical reactions to visual stimuli. Analyzing physical behaviors when presented with such stimuli can provide insights into the visual perception and motor abilities of an individual, yet there is currently no unbiased, objective, general-purpose tool that analyzes attention and motor behavior to assess neurocognitive function. We propose a novel method of neurocognitive function assessment that tests the patient's cognition using virtual reality with eye tracking and motion analysis. By placing the patient in a controlled virtual environment and analyzing their movements, we can evoke certain physical responses from subjects for neurocognitive assessment. We have developed a prototype system that places the subject in a virtual baseball field and captures their full body motion as they try to catch baseballs. This scenario tests the subject's ability to determine the landing time and position of the ball, as well as the test subject's balance, motor skills, attention, and memory. Preliminary tests with 20 healthy normal individuals demonstrate the ability of this tool to assess the test subject's balance, memory, attention, and reaction to visual stimuli. This platform has a twofold contribution: it is used to assess several neurocognitive constructs that affect visual and motor capability neutrally and objectively based on controlled stimuli, and it enables objective comparison between different neurocognitive disorders research in this field.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2881455","Comcast Media and Technology Center; CU Denver ORS; Department of Education GAANN Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536376","Behavioral analysis;motor skills;neurocognitive assessment;virtual reality;visual cognition","Visualization;Tools;Sports;Tracking;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality","brain;cognition;gaze tracking;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;virtual reality;visual perception","neurocognitive function assessment;virtual reality;eye tracking;motion analysis;controlled virtual environment;physical responses;virtual baseball field;visual stimuli;motor capability;behavioral response analysis;visual dysfunction;motor disorders;visual cognition;visual perception;motor behavior;physical behaviors;neurocognitive problems","Adult;Aged;Cognition;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Psychomotor Performance;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","1","","58","Traditional","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than presuming that patients could generalize in three conditions, this study tested whether there was any evidence of such generalization ability in healthy individuals.

The current study introduces a novel simulation approach termed memory-based motion simulation (MBMS), and presents its key element ""motion modification"" (MoM) algorithm. The proposed approach implements a computational model inspired by the generalized motor program (GMP) theory. Operationally, when a novel motion scenario is submitted to the MBMS system, its motion database is searched to find relevant existing motions. The selected motions, referred to as ""root motions"", most likely do not meet exactly the novel motion scenario, and therefore, they need to be modified by the MoM algorithm. This algorithm derives a parametric representation of possible variants of a root motion in a GMP-like manner, and adjusts the parameter values such that the new modified motion satisfies the novel motion scenario, while retaining the root motion's overall angular movement pattern and inter-joint coordination. An evaluation of the prediction capability of the algorithm, using both seated upper body reaching and whole-body load-transfer motions, indicated that the algorithm can accurately predict various human motions with errors comparable to the inherent variability in human motions when repeated under identical task conditions.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.822965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288349","","Humans;Biological system modeling;Ergonomics;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Testing;Design automation;Man machine systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Prototypes","human computer interaction;ergonomics;digital simulation;motion estimation;CAD","memory-based human motion simulation;motion modification algorithm;computer simulation;human motion planning;human machine interaction;generalized motor program theory;motion database;parametric representation;root motion;angular movement pattern;interjoint coordination;load transfer motions;human motions","","49","2","51","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Amid a larger study that is aimed to create an ecologically validated virtual reality (VR) - based experimental protocol to explore the effect of high-load physical and cognitive efforts on young individuals, the present report focuses on comparing new cognitive tasks presented in the context of simulated military missions with physical load to already established cognitive testing battery. Twelve young participants performed a 10 Km loaded march on a treadmill in VR settings with or without additional cognitive tasks (VR-COG). Each experimental day, subjects underwent pre-and post-evaluation, in which cognitive (trail making test - the color trail test CTT version, and SYNWIN battery for multitasking evaluation) and physical tests (time to exhaustion test - TTE) were conducted. In general, strong or moderate correlations were found between VR-COG performances and the cognitive tests. The VR-COG tasks, together with CTT components, were able to successfully predict the effect of the combined physical and cognitive load on the multitasking performance. Multitasking was evaluated by the SYNWIN score. We believe that our protocol allows optimal conditions for measurement of the effect of high-load physical and cognitive efforts for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the motor-cognitive interaction model knowledge base. It is apparent that virtual environments are ideal set ups for studying military activities, as they enable the participants to experience a particular situation within a controlled area.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994473","virtual reality;ecologic environments;cognitive load;SYNWIN;CTT;Arm forces;military","Task analysis;Protocols;Visualization;Legged locomotion;Virtual reality;Navigation;Batteries","cognition;human factors;neurophysiology;psychology;virtual reality","virtual reality tool;physical performance;simulated lengthy field march;rescue personnel;central nervous system reserves;ecologically validated virtual reality;experimental protocol;young individuals;simulated military missions;physical load;cognitive testing battery;young participants;10 Km loaded march;VR settings;additional cognitive tasks;post-evaluation;trail making test;color trail test CTT version;multitasking evaluation;exhaustion test - TTE;VR-COG performances;cognitive tests;VR-COG tasks;multitasking performance;motor-cognitive interaction model knowledge base;virtual environments","","","","27","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the fields of sport and fitness have turned to VR, including for locomotor activities, to enhance motor and energetic resources, as well as motivation and adherence. For example, VR can provide visual feedbacks during treadmill running, thereby reducing monotony and increasing the feeling of movement and engagement with the activity. However, the relevance of using VR tools during locomotion depends on the ability of these systems to provide natural immersive feelings, specifically a coherent perception of speed. The objective of this study is to estimate the error between actual and perceived locomotor speed in VE using an enactive approach, i.e. allowing an active control of the environment. Sixteen healthy individuals participated in the experiment, which consisted in walking and running on a motorized treadmill at speeds ranging from 3 to 11 km/h with 0.5 km/h increments, in a randomized order while wearing a HMD device (HTC Vive) displaying a virtual racetrack. Participants were instructed to match VE speed with what they perceived was their ac-tuallocomotion speed (LS), using a handheld Vive controller. They were able to modify the optic flow speed (OFS) with a 0.02 km/h increment/decrement accuracy. An optic flow multiplier (OFM) was computed based on the error between OFS and LS. It represents the gain that exists between the visually perceived speed and the real locomotion speed experienced by participants for each trial. For all conditions, the average of OFM was 1.00±.25 to best match LS. This finding is at odds with previous works reporting an underestimation of speed perception in VR. It could be explained by the use of an enactive approach allowing an active and accurate matching of visually and proprioceptively perceived speeds by participants. But above all, our study showed that the perception of speed in VR is strongly individual, with some participants always overestimating and others constantly underestimating. Therefore, a general OFM should not be used to correct speed in VE to ensure congruence in speed perception, and we propose the use of individual models as recommendations for setting up locomotion-based VR applications.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798209","Virtual reality;speed perception assessment;running in virtual environment;enaction;physical activity in VR","Legged locomotion;Adaptive optics;Resists;Optical feedback;Virtual environments;Visualization","gait analysis;helmet mounted displays;human factors;mechanoception;virtual reality","speed perception;visually perceived speeds;proprioceptively perceived speeds;locomotion-based VR applications;virtual reality devices;physical activity;locomotor activities;visual feedbacks;VR tools;natural immersive feelings;actual perceived locomotor speed;motorized treadmill;HMD device;virtual racetrack;VE speed;handheld Vive controller;optic flow speed;optic flow multiplier;visually perceived speed;locomotion speed;perceived speed error;velocity 0.5 km/h;velocity 0.02 km/h;velocity 3.0 km/h to 11.0 km/h","","","","35","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Johnson Machine can apply an adjustable resistive force of up to 100 N onto the handlebar in any direction within an 80-cm radius of a 2-DoF (Degree of Freedom) plane. It can simulate virtual objects such as weights, springs, dampers, as well as a combination of these objects, and can limit itself onto a 1-DoF path, enabling isolation exercises. The two built-in potentiometers allow for the easy variation of both the resistive forces' magnitude and direction. An exercise safety zone and an emergency switch are implemented as saftey features of Johnson Machine. The two current controlled motors that provides the end-effector force, along with gravitational and frictional compensations are derived using the Lagrangian approach. Finally, this exercise robot is able to experimentally provide resistive forces of up to 74.45 N (8 kg) and demonstrate both general-purpose and single-pose functions by assisting in several exercises such as the squat, bench press, shoulder press and the Lat-pulldown.","","978-1-7281-6694-0","10.1109/InCIT50588.2020.9310975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310975","Exercise Assistive Robot;Single-pose and General-purpose Exercise Machines;Torque Control;Impedance Control;Adjustable Resistive Force","End effectors;Force;DC motors;Safety;Friction;Couplings;Torque","end effectors;force control;friction;manipulator dynamics;medical robotics;mobile robots;motion control;path planning;patient rehabilitation;position control;potentiometers;virtual reality","current controlled motors;end-effector force;resistive forces;general-purpose;single-pose functions;universal exercise robot;impedance control;active exercise robot;Johnson Machine;single-pose exercise machines;adjustable resistive force;virtual objects;isolation exercises;exercise safety zone;mass 8.0 kg","","","","9","","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several methods now exist for estimating user intent, including an optimal feedback control model, a piecewise-linear feedback control model, ReFIT, and other heuristics. Which of these methods yields the best decoding performance? Methods: Using data from the BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial, we measured how a steady-state velocity Kalman filter decoder was affected by the choice of intention estimation method. We examined three separate components of the Kalman filter: dimensionality reduction, temporal smoothing, and output gain (speed scaling). Results: The decoder's dimensionality reduction properties were largely unaffected by the intention estimation method (the unsmoothed velocity vectors differed by <;5% in terms of how accurately they pointed at the target and how their speeds decreased near the target). In contrast, the smoothing and gain properties of the decoder were greatly affected (>50% difference in average values). Surprisingly, simulation results show that these differences in gain and smoothing values were largely arbitrary, as all methods failed to optimize the gain and smoothing values to match the task parameters. Conclusion: Our results show that, gain and smoothing differences aside, current intention estimation methods yield nearly equivalent decoders and that simple models of user intent, such as a position error vector (target position minus cursor position), perform comparably to more elaborate models. Our results also highlight that current calibration methods yield arbitrary differences in gain and smoothing properties that can confound decoder comparisons.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2783358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207634","Brain–machine interface;brain–computer interface;motor cortex","Decoding;Estimation;Calibration;Smoothing methods;Feedback control;Kalman filters;Hospitals","brain;brain-computer interfaces;calibration;decoding;feedback;Kalman filters;medical robotics;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;piecewise linear techniques","equivalent decoders;current intention estimation methods;smoothing differences;smoothing values;gain properties;output gain;steady-state velocity Kalman filter decoder;BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial;decoding performance;piecewise-linear feedback control model;optimal feedback control model;intracortical brain- computer interfaces;intracortical brain-computer interfaces;decoder calibration;intention estimation method;decoder comparisons;smoothing properties;current calibration methods;user intent","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Computer Simulation;Female;Humans;Intention;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Motor Cortex;Movement;Quadriplegia;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","4","","36","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is unclear how this accuracy relates to the overall user experience. As recognition accuracy is difficult to control in a real affective feedback loop, we describe a method of simulating recognition accuracy in a game where difficulty is increased or decreased after each round. The game was played by 261 participants at different simulated recognition accuracies. Participants reported their satisfaction with the recognition algorithm as well as their overall game experience. We observed that in such a game, the affective feedback loop must adapt game difficulty with an accuracy of at least 80 percent to be accepted by users. Furthermore, users who do not enjoy the game are likely to stop playing it rather than continue playing and report low enjoyment. However, the acceptable recognition accuracy may not generalize to other contexts, and studies of affect recognition accuracies in other applications are needed.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2326870","Swiss National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824221","Affective computing;computer games;machine learning;physiological computing;user acceptance;Affective computing;computer games;machine learning;physiological computing;user acceptance","Games;Accuracy;Feedback loop;Computers;Affective computing;Robot sensing systems;Electroencephalography","behavioural sciences computing;computer games;emotion recognition;physiology","recognition accuracy linking;user experience;affective feedback loop;affect recognition;recognition algorithm;game experience;computer games","","7","","17","","2 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate clinical assessment of spasticity is critical in the determination of patient treatment, although physical evidence of spasticity is often confused with that of related neuromuscular disorders. By repeatably simulating different levels of spastic severity, we hope to improve clinician training for rating spasticity and consequently decrease the variability of ratings between raters and within raters. Our haptic device, designed to replicate the spastic elbow of a child, uses a brake actuator and high-resolution optical encoder. Two competing spasticity models from the literature are implemented. Preliminary experiments indicate that the decreased stretch reflex threshold model is more realistic than the increased stiffness model.

Such devices consist of engine section mockups for use with a real borescope. Our approach instead simulates engine sections in virtual reality, replacing the need for physical mockups. We model the engine casing as a ""black box"" where a simulated borescope tip is inserted (in practice a real borescope is used to provide tactile veridicality of the probe's braided sheath but the camera at its tip is not used). The probe's translational movement is mapped to the virtual camera's. The graphical engine representation can conceivably generalize to any engine section that can be modeled graphically. Since the interior chamber of the ""black box"" casing is empty, the critical component of our simulator is correct borescope tip navigation as well as force feedback response based on a mathematical model of collision detection of the tip in the computer generated environment. Haptic response is thought to be a key component of the simulator as it provides non-visual tactile awareness of the borescope tip within the engine under inspection and, more importantly, its contact with engine surfaces. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we design a novel motor-powered clamp that provides collision response to collision of the camera detected in virtual space. Second, we attempt to isolate the effect of the system's tactile response and provide empirical evaluation of its utility. In line with previous results, our empirical analysis reveals a trend toward a benefit in performance (speed), but suggests that the provision of haptic feedback, while preferred over a solely visual interface, may be perceived as extraneous in a visually-dominated discrimination task.","","978-1-4244-2047-6","10.1109/3DUI.2008.4476586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476586","I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniques¿Ergonomics;J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences¿Psychology","Haptic interfaces;Engines;Inspection;Cameras;Computational modeling;Aircraft propulsion;Turbines;Educational institutions;Virtual reality;Computer simulation","aerospace engineering;computer based training;engines;force feedback;graphical user interfaces;haptic interfaces;mechanical engineering computing;virtual reality","haptic virtual borescope;visual engine inspection training;aircraft engine inspection training;virtual reality;graphical engine representation;black box casing;borescope tip navigation;force feedback response;collision detection;computer generated environment","","1","1","19","","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A significant body of research has demonstrated how perception and action work in such environments, but most of this work has been done studying adults. Less is known about how physical and cognitive development affect perception and action in IVEs, particularly as applied to preteen and teenage children. Accordingly, in the current study we assess how preteens (children aged 8-12 years) and teenagers (children aged 15-18 years) respond to mismatches between their motor behavior and the visual information presented by an IVE. Over two experiments, we evaluate how these individuals recalibrate their actions across functionally distinct systems of movement. The first experiment analyzed forward walking recalibration after exposure to an IVE with either increased or decreased visual flow. Visual flow during normal bipedal locomotion was manipulated to be either twice or half as fast as the physical gait. The second experiment leveraged a prism throwing adaptation paradigm to test the effect of recalibration on throwing movement. In the first experiment, our results show no differences across age groups, although subjects generally experienced a post-exposure effect of shortened distance estimation after experiencing visually faster flow and longer distance estimation after experiencing visually slower flow. In the second experiment, subjects generally showed the typical prism adaptation behavior of a throwing after-effect error. The error lasted longer for preteens than older children. Our results have implications for the design of virtual systems with children as a target audience.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794072","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267487","Virtual environments;perceptual-motor recalibration;perception;children","Legged locomotion;Visualization;Virtual environments;Biomechanics;Calibration;Electronic mail","gait analysis;virtual reality;visual perception","teenage children;visual information;normal bipedal locomotion;physical gait;adaptation paradigm;throwing movement;post-exposure effect;visually faster flow;visually slower flow;throwing after-effect error;virtual systems;locomotive recalibration;immersive virtual environments;action work;physical development;cognitive development;visual flow;virtual reality;prism adaptation behavior;time 8 year to 12 year;time 15 year to 18 year","Adaptation, Physiological;Adolescent;Child;Female;Humans;Male;Perception;Psychomotor Performance;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Walking","","","81","Traditional","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the early stages, symptoms are mild and patients may ignore their existence. As a result, they do not undergo any related clinical examination; hence delaying their PD diagnosis. In an effort to remedy such delay, analysis of data passively captured from user's interaction with consumer technologies has been recently explored towards remote screening of early PD motor signs. In the current study, a smartphone-based method analyzing subjects' finger interaction with the smartphone screen is developed for the quantification of fine-motor skills decline in early PD using Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results from the analysis of keystroke typing in-the-clinic data from 18 early PD patients and 15 healthy controls have shown a classification performance of 0.89 Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 0.79/0.79 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. Evaluation of the generalization ability of the proposed approach was made by its application on typing data arising from a separate self-reported cohort of 27 PD patients' and 84 healthy controls' daily usage with their personal smartphones (data in-the-wild), achieving 0.79 AUC with 0.74/0.78 sensitivity/specificity, respectively.

The eye gaze behavior is determined by the tradeoff between these two distributions, where the goal is to preserve the task-related constraints, while remaining as close as possible to the saliency distribution representing a comfort zone. Based on minimum Kullback-Liebler divergence principles, the model gives rise to a family of gaze distributions controlled by a single tradeoff parameter. The model was evaluated experimentally in a driving simulator that consisted of an immersive environment with clear tasks and accurate monitoring capabilities. The findings confirm the theoretical predictions with respect to the low rank manifold and order relations in the data.

This study determined whether it takes longer to learn to control a virtual limb actuated by a muscle model compared to a simpler force-generator model. Subjects practiced moving a myoelectrically-driven virtual limb from rest to a target position with maximum speed and accuracy. In a muscle model group (n=10), the biceps electromyographic signal activated a virtual muscle that pulled on the virtual limb with a force governed by muscle dynamics, defined by a nonlinear force-length-velocity relation and series-elastic stiffness. A forcegenerator group (n=10) performed the same task, but the actuation force was a linear function of the biceps activation signal. Generalization was assessed with untrained target trials. The results showed that the muscle model group improved performance as fast as the force-generator group and showed greater generalization in early practice. This suggests that incorporating muscle dynamics into a virtual limb does not incur a learning “cost” over the use of simpler actuator models.","2160-7028","978-1-4799-3728-8","10.1109/NEBEC.2014.6972812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6972812","virtual limb;muscle mechanics;motor learning;prosthetic limb;muscle dynamics;nervous system","Muscles;Force;Dynamics;Prosthetics;Actuators;Standards;Measurement uncertainty","biomechanics;elastic constants;electromyography;physiological models;prosthetics;virtual reality","actuator properties;learning to control;prosthetic devices;muscle dynamics;learning demands;simpler force-generator model;myoelectrically-driven virtual limb;rest position;target position;maximum speed;maximum accuracy;muscle model group;biceps electromyographic signal;virtual muscle;nonlinear force-length-velocity relation;series-elastic stiffness;actuation force;linear function;biceps activation signal;generalization;untrained target trials;force-generator group;learning cost","","","","5","","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various factors such as asymmetrical information distribution and across-channel redundancy may, however, limit the benefit of high-dimensional signal sets, and the increased computational complexity may not yield corresponding improvement in system performance. High-dimensional system models may also lead to overfitting and lack of generalizability. To address these issues, we present a generalized modulation depth measure using the state-space framework that quantifies the tuning of a neural signal channel to relevant behavioral covariates. For a dynamical system, we develop computationally efficient procedures for estimating modulation depth from multivariate data. We show that this measure can be used to rank neural signals and select an optimal channel subset for inclusion in the neural decoding algorithm. We present a scheme for choosing the optimal subset based on model order selection criteria. We apply this method to neuronal ensemble spike-rate decoding in neural interfaces, using our framework to relate motor cortical activity with intended movement kinematics. With offline analysis of intracortical motor imagery data obtained from individuals with tetraplegia using the BrainGate neural interface, we demonstrate that our variable selection scheme is useful for identifying and ranking the most information-rich neural signals. We demonstrate that our approach offers several orders of magnitude lower complexity but virtually identical decoding performance compared to greedy search and other selection schemes. Our statistical analysis shows that the modulation depth of human motor cortical single-unit signals is well characterized by the generalized Pareto distribution. Our variable selection scheme has wide applicability in problems involving multisensor signal modeling and estimation in biomedical engineering systems.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2360393","Department of Defense; Department of Veterans Affairs; National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; Wings for Life Spinal Cord Research Foundation; Doris Duke Foundation; MGH Neurological Clinical Research Institute, and MGH Deane Institute for Integrated Research on Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke; Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911990","Brain–computer interface (BCI);brain–machine interface (BMI);feature selection;modulation depth (MD);neural decoding;neural interface;state-space model;tetraplegia;variable selection;Brain–computer interface (BCI);brain–machine interface (BMI);feature selection;modulation depth (MD);neural decoding;neural interface;state-space model;tetraplegia;variable selection","Signal to noise ratio;Covariance matrices;Input variables;Vectors;Modulation;Decoding","brain-computer interfaces;diseases;medical signal processing;modulation;neurophysiology;Pareto distribution;state-space methods","biomedical engineering system;multisensor signal modeling;Pareto distribution;single-unit signal;human motor cortical signal;statistical analysis;variable selection scheme;BrainGate neural interface;tetraplegia;intracortical motor imagery data;movement kinematics;motor cortical activity;spike-rate decoding;model order selection criteria;optimal subset;neural decoding algorithm;multivariate data;neural signal channel;high-dimensional system model;neural activity;neural interface technology;state-space models;modulation depth estimation","Action Potentials;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Humans;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Motor Cortex;Motor Neurons;Quadriplegia;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","10","","40","","26 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motor imagery (MI) paradigm is widely used in non-invasive BCI to control external devices by decoding user intentions. The traditional MI-BCI problem is to obtain enough EEG data samples for adopting deep learning techniques, as electroencephalography (EEG) data have intricate and non-stationary properties that can cause a discrepancy between different sessions of data. Because of the discrepancy, the recorded EEG data with different sessions cannot be treated as the same. In this study, we recorded a large intuitive EEG dataset that contained nine types of movements of a single-arm across 12 subjects. We proposed a SessionNet that learns generality with EEG data recorded over multiple sessions using feature similarity to improve classification performance. Additionally, the SessionNet adopts the principle of a hierarchical convolutional neural network that shows robust classification performance regardless of the number of classes. The SessionNet outperforms conventional methods on 3-class, 5-class, and two types of 7-class and 9-class of a single-arm task. Hence, our approach could demonstrate the possibility of using feature similarity based on a novel ensemble learning method to train generality from multiple session data for better MI classification performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011140","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) funded by the Korea Government through the Development of Intelligent Pattern Recognition Softwares for Ambulatory Brain-Computer Interface; Development of Non-Invasive Integrated BCI SW Platform to Control Home Appliances and External Devices by User’s Thought via AR/VR Interface; Department of Artificial Intelligence, Korea University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146526","Brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);convolutional neural network (CNN);weighted ensemble learning","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Indexes;Visualization;Training;Protocols","brain-computer interfaces;convolutional neural nets;electroencephalography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;signal classification","brain-computer interface;direct communication pathway;motor imagery paradigm;noninvasive BCI;user intention decoding;traditional MI-BCI problem;deep learning techniques;electroencephalography data;nonstationary properties;intuitive EEG dataset;SessionNet;hierarchical convolutional neural network;robust classification performance;single-arm task;multiple session data;MI classification performance;motor imagery classification;feature similarity-based weighted ensemble learning;external devices;EEG data samples","","2","","58","CCBY","23 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After the product integration design is finalized, the Production Tool Design and Build (PTDB) processes becomes the VDP critical path. It is in the PTDB where virtual launch and validation activities are performed. To increase throughput of the engineering factory and reduce product development cost, we propose a research initiative in the area of Virtual Launch & Validation (VLV) of Manufacturing Automation Controls (MAC). VLV of MAC is composed of a series of PTDB launch and pre-launch activities in a virtual environment using physical, emulated, and simulated hardware and software. It encompasses the testing of MAC, its interactions with MAC analysis tools, and its interfaces with IT systems and related business processes. VLV of MAC also supports the development and testing of new IT systems and business processes as well as its hardware and software plant floor systems constituents. The mission of VLV of MAC is to minimize the duration of the launch and ramp up activities by reducing the implementation and execution times for plant floor systems and equipments via a priori system emulation, validation and testing. Based on our findings, we conclude that the most pressing needs for VLV of MAC lie in the thrust areas of object-oriented standard logic, auto-generation of virtual models, logic validation and system wide emulation. In summary, we conservatively estimate that a successful VLV of MAC implementation will reduce the VDP duration by several weeks hence providing automakers with savings in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per year.","2161-8089","978-1-4244-5449-5","10.1109/COASE.2010.5583977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5583977","","Object oriented modeling;Vehicles;Production;Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Software","automobile industry;factory automation;machine tools;product design;product development;virtual reality","automotive industry;manufacturing engineering activity;vehicle development process;product integration design;production tool design and build;PTDB process;VDP critical path;virtual launch and validation;engineering factory;product development cost;manufacturing automation control;virtual environment;MAC analysis tool;IT system;business process;plant floor system;object-oriented standard logic;virtual model;logic validation","","","","45","","21 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rehabilitation is the main therapeutic approach for reducing poststroke functional deficits but significant variability exists between patients regarding rehabilitation efficacy. Because the recovery mechanisms induced by rehabilitation are not fully understood, it is still not clear which treatment approaches and techniques are most beneficial. Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-based environment that provides the users an immersive experience of a synthetic world and allows a systemic testing of human functions under the simulated environment of controllable parameters. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of VR based rehabilitation for improving the upper limb functional recovery. However, the question which components in the VR game are most valuable for promoting the recovery has not been examined. This study aims to identify the motion kinetics extracted from the VR based rehabilitation that are significantly correlated with the functional improvement. Twenty-one stroke patients were recruited and received 1 hour rehabilitation with the intensity of 3 times per week over 8 weeks, in total 24 training sessions, using a home-made VR program. All patients underwent the evaluation of their function before and after rehabilitation by Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA). The parameters of human kinetics, such as speed/max speed, velocity and trajectory during VR-based rehabilitation were recorded digitally and the changes of the kinetics after finishing 24 training sessions were then correlated with the post-rehabilitation changes of FMA. The statistic result showed that the increase of efficiency, speed stability and straightness of trajectory leads to a better functional improvement, in addition to the increase of palm strength. In conclusion, the changes of the improvement-related motor kinetics could serve as guidance when designing the individualized treatment strategy.","","978-1-5090-4897-7","10.1109/ICASI.2017.7988517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988517","virtual reality (VR) based rehabilitation;Kinematic Features;individualized treatment","Kinetic theory;Virtual reality;Games;Training;Trajectory;Extremities;Conferences","medical computing;patient treatment;virtual reality","improvement related motor kinetics;virtual reality;rehabilitation;stroke;adult disability;stroke survivors;motor deficits;upper limb;UL;therapeutic approach;post stroke functional;recovery mechanisms;computer based environment;synthetic world;human functions;simulated environment;controllable parameters;upper limb functional recovery;VR game;motion kinetics extraction;Fugl-Meyer assessment;FMA;human kinetics;individualized treatment strategy","","1","","17","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first experiment operators experienced an illusion of embodiment (in terms of body ownership and agency) for the robot's body only by imagining a movement (motor imagery) and watching the robot perform it. Also using the same setup, we could further discover that during BCI-operation of the android, biasing the timing and accuracy of the performance feedback could improve operators' modulation of brain activities for the motor imagery task. Our experiments showed that the motor imagery skills acquired through this technique were not limited to the android robot, and had long-lasting effects for other BCI usage as well.

However, most of the previous studies focused on the average LLR activity of a particular genotype, which left information that could address differences in individual zebrafish development unattended. In this study, machine learning techniques were employed to distinguish not only zebrafish larvae of different genotypes, but also different batches, based on their response to light stimuli. This approach allows us to perform efficient high-throughput zebrafish screening with relatively simple preparations. Following the general machine learning framework, some discriminative features were first extracted from the behavioral data. Both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms were implemented for the classification of zebrafish of different genotypes and batches. The accuracy of the classification in genotype was over 80 percent and could achieve up to 95 percent in some cases.

When potential danger is detected, the ARS alerts the driver by progressively indicating the time to collision to the lead vehicle as well as merging vehicles from side lanes by an AR display that overlaps with the lead or merging vehicles. We tested the ARS with younger (18-30) and older (65-75) drivers in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Results showed that the ARS could significantly reduce collisions caused by hazard events such as sudden slowing of the lead vehicle or merging of vehicles from sides lanes. Consistent with previous results, older drivers, despite age-related decline in cognitive and motor abilities, could leverage their driving experience to avoid forward collisions with the lead vehicle as much as younger drivers. However, older drivers were poorer in avoiding collisions caused by sudden merging events than younger drivers. The ARS was found to be most useful in helping older adults to avoid collision caused by sudden hazard events, especially with the presence of a distraction task. The ARS was also more effective for older than younger drivers to encourage a safe driving distance with the lead vehicle. Interestingly, there seemed to be differential effects of the ARS on the general driving behavior of younger and older drivers.

Nevertheless, a majority of previous studies have found that haptic guidance is ineffective, or sometimes even detrimental, to motor skill learning. In this paper, we propose the opposite concept, haptic disturbance, and evaluate its efficacy. In haptic disturbance, haptic cues that interfere with the movements of a learner are presented during training. We designed two methods of haptic disturbance using repulsive and noise-like forces, respectively. The effects of these methods were experimentally assessed, comparatively with the conventional methods of visual learning only and progressive haptic guidance. The motor task was to track a dot moving on a 2D plane with a haptic interface operated with one arm. We found that during training, the progressive haptic guidance showed the best tracking accuracy, but in immediate and delayed retention tests, the noise-like haptic disturbance led to the best performance. The results suggest high potentials for haptic disturbance to be a general strategy for expediting the motor learning process.","2324-7355","978-1-4244-6822-5","10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444635","","Haptic interfaces;Feedback;Testing;Virtual reality;Humans;Computer graphics;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Laboratories;Computer science","computer based training;graphical user interfaces;haptic interfaces;human factors","haptic guidance;haptic disturbance;human motor skill learning;haptic cues;repulsive force;noise like force","","65","","36","","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the alternatives to bypass that problem is the development of technologies which can partially replace the loss functioning of people with severe motor impairment. The imagination of the movement is considered as a cognitive state which corresponds to the mental simulation of a given motor action. The general aim of this investigative research is to develop a brain-computer based interface for the movement imagination of the left fist, right fist, both fists and both feet in order to control an intelligent wheelchair. The electroencephalography signals were acquired through the database eegmmidb - EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset.

Subjects learned to perform the sequences under three primary training paradigms: listening to the rhythm (audio), being guided through the motions involved in the rhythm's performance (haptic), and being guided through the required motions while listening to the resulting sound (audio+haptic). Performance was assessed in terms of both timing and loudness (velocity) accuracy using several different metrics. 	Results indicate that haptic guidance can significantly benefit recall of both note timing and velocity. When subject performance was compared in terms of note velocity recall, the addition of haptic guidance to audio-based training produced a 17% reduction in final error when compared to audio training alone.

We developed a virtual reality visio-haptic simulator to assist surgical residents in training to resolve visio-motor conflict. The developed simulator offers individuals the flexibility to train in various scenarios with different levels of visio-motor conflicts. The levels of conflict were simulated by creating a linear functional relation between movement in the real environment and the virtual environment. The haptic rendering was consistent with the visual feedback. Experiments were conducted with expert pediatric surgeons and general surgery residents. Baseline data on performance in conditions of visio-motor conflict were assimilated from expert surgeons. Residents were divided into experimental group that was exposed to visio-motor conflict and the control group which wasnpsilat exposed to visio-motor conflict training. When the performance was compared on a standard surgical suturing task, the residents with inter-modal conflict training performed better than the control group suggesting the construct validity of the training and that visio-motor training can accelerate learning.","","978-1-4244-2668-3","10.1109/HAVE.2008.4685290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685290","Virtual Reality;Medical Simulation;Haptic User Interfaces;Surgical Simulation","Virtual reality;Minimally invasive surgery;Feedback;Humans;Cameras;Haptic interfaces;Medical simulation;Ergonomics;Biological system modeling;Patient monitoring","computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;rendering (computer graphics);surgery;virtual reality","virtual reality based training;visio-motor conflicts;surgical environments;minimally invasive surgery;visual feedback;linear functional relation;haptic rendering;visio-motor training","","3","","10","","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Standard approaches include a calibration phase to estimate decoding parameters. During iBCI operation, the statistical properties of the neural activity can depart from those observed during calibration, sometimes hindering a user's ability to control the iBCI. To address this problem, we adaptively correct the offset terms within a Kalman filter decoder via penalized maximum likelihood estimation. The approach can handle rapid shifts in neural signal behavior (on the order of seconds) and requires no knowledge of the intended movement. The algorithm, called multiple offset correction algorithm (MOCA), was tested using simulated neural activity and evaluated retrospectively using data collected from two people with tetraplegia operating an iBCI. In 19 clinical research test cases, where a nonadaptive Kalman filter yielded relatively high decoding errors, MOCA significantly reduced these errors (10.6 ±10.1%; p <; 0.05, pairwise t-test). MOCA did not significantly change the error in the remaining 23 cases where a nonadaptive Kalman filter already performed well. These results suggest that MOCA provides more robust decoding than the standard Kalman filter for iBCIs.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2287768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651795","Adaptive filtering;brain–computer interfaces (BCI);brain–machine interfaces (BMI);Kalman filter;motor cortex;neural decoding","Kalman filters;Vectors;Educational institutions;Standards;Calibration;Maximum likelihood decoding","adaptive Kalman filters;bioelectric potentials;brain;brain-computer interfaces;calibration;decoding;diseases;maximum likelihood estimation;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","adaptive offset correction;intracortical brain-computer interfaces;movement decoding parameter estimation;robotic arm;calibration phase;statistical properties;penalized maximum likelihood estimation;adaptive Kalman filter decoder;neural signal behavior;multiple offset correction algorithm;simulated neural activity;tetraplegia;pairwise t-test","Algorithms;Arm;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Cerebral Cortex;Computer Simulation;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Hand;Humans;Likelihood Functions;Motor Cortex;Neural Pathways;Quadriplegia;Robotics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","10","","51","","1 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome this limitation, we propose to replace some most used touch operations with gesture controls for mobile devices in a driving environment. Gesture control is simple, more flexible and requires less eye focus, which makes it more suitable for in-vehicle usages. In this paper, we design Givs, a fully functional gesture control system for mobile devices in a driving environment. Givs leverages the latest motion sensing technology to enable ubiquitous and driving-friendly gestures. Compared to other off-the-shelf gesture recognition solutions, Givs is optimized for in-vehicle use cases and is designed to overcome various limitations caused by real driving conditions, including bumpy road conditions, significant noise introduced by car vibration and technical limitations of motion sensors. Our extensive in-vehicle tests and participant experience experiments demonstrate that Givs well assists users in accomplishing various types of tasks and support human-machine interaction in driving environments such as personal vehicle and public transport, with high accuracy and fast responsiveness, while promoting drivnig convenience and safety.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8984325","Human-machine interaction;smart sensing;mobile computing;driving safety","Sensors;Motion detection;Mobile handsets;Delays;Hardware;Automobiles;Tracking","gesture recognition;human computer interaction;mobile computing;road vehicles;touch sensitive screens;traffic engineering computing","fine-grained gesture control;mobile devices;driving environment;hand-held usage scenarios;fully functional gesture control system;driving-friendly gestures;off-the-shelf gesture recognition solutions;driving conditions;Givs","","1","","40","CCBY","5 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike many other gloves based on string-pulleys, the Dexmo uses a free-hinged link-bar to transfer forces from a crank to the fingertips. It also uses an admittance-based controller parameterized by position, as opposed to an impedance-based controller parameterized by force. When setting the controller's target position, developers must use its native angular coordinate system. The Dexmo has a number of uninstrumented degrees of freedom. Mature forward models can reliably predict the hand pose, even with these unknowns. When it comes to computing angular controller parameters from a target pose in Cartesian space however, things become more difficult. Complex models that provide attractive visuals from a small number of sensors can be non-trivial or even impossible to invert. In this letter, we suggest side-stepping this issue. We sample the forward model in order to build a lookup table. This is embedded in three-dimensional space as a curve, on which traditional queries against world geometry can be performed. Controller parameters are stored as attributes of the sample points. To compute the driver parameters for a target position, the application constrains the position to the geometry, and interpolates them. This technique is generalizable, stable, simple, and fast.

Four subjects were studied with event-related fMRI while doing simple paretic hand finger movements before (double baseline) and after training. Bilateral hand movements were recorded and used to provide real-time feedback to subjects during scanning to eliminate performance confounds on fMRI results. The kinematic parameters of each movement were also used in the general linear model with the BOLD signal to investigate training-induced changes in neuromotor coupling. Univariate analysis showed an increase in BOLD signal in the ipsilesional hemisphere in two subjects and a decrease in activity in the other two subjects. Seed voxel based functional connectivity analysis revealed an increase in connectivity between ipsilesional motor cortex and bilateral sensorimotor cortex during finger movements in all four subjects. Hemispheric laterality index values showed a tendency to decrease reflecting a reduction in the over-dominance of the contralesional hemisphere. The study is novel in terms of 1) tracking finger movement during a motor task in the scanner, 2) monitoring motor performance during the experiment and 3) giving online visual feedback of subjects' movement. This pilot study introduces a novel approach to study neural plasticity by combining measures of regional intensity, interregional interactions (using functional connectivity analysis and hemispheric laterality index), and modulation in the strength of neuromotor coupling.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6092002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092002","","Training;Robot sensing systems;Thumb;Angular velocity;Kinematics;Couplings","biomechanics;biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;medical image processing;medical robotics;neurophysiology;virtual reality","neural reorganization;chronic stroke;virtual reality training;brain reorganization;robot-assisted arm;hand training;event-related fMRI;paretic hand finger movements;bilateral hand movements;real-time feedback;BOLD signal;univariate analysis;functional connectivity analysis;ipsilesional motor cortex;bilateral sensorimotor cortex;tracking finger movement;online visual feedback;neural plasticity;hemispheric laterality index;neuromotor coupling","Aged;Chronic Disease;Female;Functional Laterality;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Net;Nervous System;Oxygen;Robotics;Stroke;Stroke;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface","9","","20","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, a number of vibrotactile displays have been developed to extend sensory modalities in virtual reality. Some of these target the whole body as the stimulation region, but existing systems are only designed for discrete stimulation points at specific parts of the body. However, since human tactile sensation has more resolution, a higher density might be required in factor alignment in order to realize general-purpose vibrotactile displays. One problem with this approach is that it might result in an impractically high number of required tactors. Our current focus is to explore ways of simplifying the system while maintaining an acceptable level of expressive ability. As a first step, we chose a well-studied task: tactile letter reading. We examined the possibility of distinguishing alphanumeric letters by using only a 3-by-3 array of vibrating motors on the back of a chair. The tactors are driven sequentially in the same sequence as if someone were tracing the letter on the chair's back. The results showed 87% successful letter recognition in some cases, which was close to the results in previous research with much larger arrays.","","0-7695-2112-6","10.1109/HAPTIC.2004.1287227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287227","","Computer displays;Virtual reality;Humans;Virtual environment;Haptic interfaces;Information science;Laboratories;Computer science;Knowledge engineering;Elbow","haptic interfaces;virtual reality;character recognition;touch (physiological)","vibrotactile letter reading;tactor array;vibrotactile displays;sensory substitution;virtual reality;letter recognition;human tactile sensation","","37","","21","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While restoration of certain degree of proximal and global movements and function is expected, the recovery of premorbid hand mobility and dexterity is less likely to occur. Although great efforts are usually made to rehabilitate these skills, with customized particular and analytic exercises, their assessment is rarely made with the same level of specificity. In general, hand and finger mobility and functionality are indirectly assessed in the clinic with standardized clinical scales and tests that require the use of these skills to perform some tasks. Although these scales are easy to administer, they can present poor accuracy, be biased, and do not allow for isolated assessment of joints and movements. Multi-touch technology enables interaction with electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with on-screen finger touches. Although there is a very limited number of studies that investigate the potential of this technology to rehabilitate hand mobility and dexterity, the use of this technology for assessment of these skills remains unexplored. This study evaluates the feasibility of a multi-touch-based assessment tool (app) of hand mobility and dexterity in a sample of post-stroke survivors. Our results provide preliminary evidence that this technology can be used to design valid and reliable instruments for assessing hand mobility and dexterity that, in addition, are sensitive to the severity of the motor impairment of the upper limb after stroke, which could complement conventional clinical assessment.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994584","hand mobility;hand dexterity;assessment;stroke;validity;upper limb;tablet;multi-touch technology;app","Thumb;Tools;Instruments;Reliability;Stroke (medical condition);Performance evaluation","biomechanics;diseases;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;touch sensitive screens","post-stroke survivors;conventional clinical assessment;multitouch-based assessment tool;on-screen finger touches;multitouch technology;isolated assessment;standardized clinical scales;finger mobility;analytic exercises;customized particular exercises;premorbid hand mobility;global movements;proximal movements;occupational therapy interventions;physical therapy interventions;upper limb function;upper limb impairment severity;hand dexterity","","","","16","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main objective is to build a simple development platform based on a commercially available 14-channel electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to control a 3D game. The proposed method consists on harvesting, recording and processing of EEG data from an Emotiv Epoc+ headset. Support vector machine (SVM), linear neural network (NN) and decision trees (DT) are used to build machine learning models and are compared based on statistical measures. The models are trained on two control states: forward and backward, in order to control the character in the game. In the first stage of modeling, each user is built using its own unique model based on the data gathered during user training. Then a more general model is developed to allow plug and play interactions with many users, without the need for retraining. The proposed classifiers are able to sufficiently model brain control for a single user with acceptable errors for the motor action training dataset, but fail to generalize to datasets with multiple users. Feature extraction improves learning of the models like neural network, but decreases the number of learning samples which calls for more datasets to generalize results for multiple users. The 3D game used for control is built on Unity 5 game engine. The traditional navigation controls in the game are mapped to the machine learning model predictions, while the internal Gyroscope is used for panning and rotation.","2326-8239","978-1-7281-3458-1","10.1109/CIS-RAM47153.2019.9095807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095807","Electroencephalography;brain-computer interface;support vector machine;linear neural network;decision trees","Games;Electroencephalography;Three-dimensional displays;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Headphones","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;signal classification;support vector machines","14-channel electroencephalography-based brain-computer interface;Emotiv Epoc+ headset;decision trees;machine learning models;brain control;motor action training dataset;linear neural network;Unity 5 game engine;machine learning model predictions;brain signals;neurophysiological signals;direct communication pathway;14-channel Emotiv Epoc+;SVM;support vector machine;3D game;feature extraction","","","","22","","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past few decades, there have been numerous studies in the autonomous vehicle motion control. These studies typically focused on improving the control accuracy of the autonomous driving vehicles. In addition to the control accuracy, driver/passenger comfort is also an important performance measure of the system. As an extension of authors' prior study, this paper further considers vehicle motion control to provide driver/passenger comfort based on the adjustment of the lane change maneuvering time in various traffic situations. While defining the driver/passenger comfort level is a human factor study topic, this paper proposes a framework to integrate the motion smoothness into the existing lane centering/changing control problem. The proposed algorithm is capable of providing smooth and aggressive lane change maneuvers according to traffic situation and driver preference. Several simulation results as well as on-road vehicle test results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2153-0017","978-1-4673-3063-3","10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338738","","Vehicles;Acceleration;Mathematical model;Roads;Equations;Motion control;Human factors","human factors;mobile robots;motion control;road traffic control;road vehicles","automated lane centering/changing control;motion smoothness adaptation;General Motors Research and Development;autonomous vehicle motion control;control accuracy;autonomous driving vehicle;lane change maneuvering time;traffic situation;driver/passenger comfort level;human factor;driver preference;on-road vehicle test","","20","","9","","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It would be highly advantageous to tap into data containing people's motor patterns from motion sensing devices to analyze subtle changes in cognitive abilities, thereby providing personalized interventions before the actual onset of such conditions. However, this goal is very challenging due to two main technical problems: 1) the size of data labeled by doctors is small, and 2) the available data tends to be highly imbalanced (the vast majority tend to be from normal subjects with only a small fraction from subjects with cognitive disorder). In order to effectively deal with these challenges to infer cognitive wellness from motor patterns with high accuracy, we propose the MOtor-Cognitive Analytics (MOCA) framework. The proposed MOCA first uses the random oversampling iterative random forest based feature selection method to reduce the feature space dimensionality and avoid overfitting, and then adds a bias in the optimization problem of weighted extreme learning machine to achieve good generalization ability in handling imbalanced small-sampling dataset. Experimental results on two real-world datasets including SVD and stroke patients show that MOCA can effectively reduce the rate of misdiagnosis and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in inferring people's cognitive capabilities. This work opens up opportunities for population-level pre-screening using motion sensing devices and can inform current discussions on reforming the health-care infrastructure.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2820024","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its IDM Futures Funding Initiative; Nanyang Assistant Professorship, Nanyang Technological University; Singapore Ministry of Health under its National Innovation Challenge on Active and Confident Ageing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326510","Correlation analysis;motor pattern;cognitive wellness;imbalanced small-sampling feature selection;imbalanced classification","Feature extraction;Classification;Data collection;Sensors;Magnetic resonance imaging;Support vector machines","cognition;data analysis;diseases;feature selection;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;optimisation;pattern classification;random processes","cognitive wellness;motor pattern;cognitive disorder;motor-cognitive analytics framework;Parkinson's disease;PD;optimization problem;weighted extreme learning machine;SVD;stroke patients;inferring peoples cognitive capabilities;health-care infrastructure;population-level pre-screening;random oversampling iterative random forest based feature selection method;MOCA;motion sensing devices;cerebral small vessel disease","","4","","63","","27 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

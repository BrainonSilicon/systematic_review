Lok","College of Engineering, University of Florida, USA; Dept. of Surgery Medical College of Georgia, USA; Feinberg School of Medicine , Northwestern University, USA; College of Engineering, University of Florida, USA","2009 8th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","17 Nov 2009","2009","","","125","134","This paper proposes an approach to mixed environment training of manual tasks requiring concurrent use of psychomotor and cognitive skills. To train concurrent use of both skill sets, the learner is provided real-time generated, in-situ presented visual feedback of her performance. This feedback provides reinforcement and correction of psychomotor skills concurrently with guidance in developing cognitive models of the task. The general approach is presented: 1) Sensors placed in the physical environment detect in real-time a learner's manipulation of physical objects. 2) Sensor data is input to models of task performance which output quantitative measures of the learner's performance. 3) Pre-defined rules are applied to transform the learner's performance data into visual feedback presented in realtime and in-situ with the physical objects being manipulated. With guidance from medical education experts, we have applied this approach to a mixed environment for learning clinical breast exams (CBEs). CBE belongs to a class of tasks that require learning multiple cognitive elements and task-specific psychomotor skills. Traditional approaches to learning CBEs and other joint psychomotor-cognitive tasks rely on extensive one-onone training with an expert providing subjective feedback. By integrating real-time visual feedback of learners' quantitatively measured CBE performance, a mixed environment for learning CBEs provides on-demand learning opportunities with more objective, detailed feedback than available with expert observation. The proposed approach applied to learning CBEs was informally evaluated by four expert medical educators and six novice medical students. This evaluation highlights that receiving real-time in-situ visual feedback of their performance provides students an advantage, over traditional approaches to learning CBEs, in developing correct psychomotor and cognitive skills.","","978-1-4244-5390-0","10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336485","mixed reality;information visualization","Psychology;Breast;Educational institutions;Assembly;Visualization;Education;Object detection;Output feedback;Virtual reality;Computer applications","augmented reality;biomedical education;computer based training;feedback;medical computing;patient diagnosis","real-time in-situ visual feedback;task performance;learning;mixed environment training;psychomotor skills;cognitive skills;skills reinforcement;skills correction;learner manipulation;physical objects;output quantitative measure;medical education;clinical breast exam;detailed feedback;medical students","","22","","30","","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years the idea of using video game technology in surgical education for laparoscopy has also been explored, however few have attempted to make a connection between video game experience and robotic surgical skills. Thus, the current study aims to examine the performance of video gamers in a virtual reality robotic surgery simulator. Furthermore, the video gamers' performance was compared to that of medical students, expert robotic surgeons, and “laypeople.” The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that video gamers acquire perceptual and psychomotor skills through video game play, similar to those used by robotic surgeons. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and performed three computer-based perceptual tests: a Flanker compatibility task, a subsidizing task, and a Multiple Object Tracking test. Participants then performed two warm-up exercises and eight trials of two core exercises on a robotic surgery simulator. After completing all trials, participants completed a post-questionnaire regarding their experience with the system. Expert video gamers (n=40), medical students (n=24), laypeople (n=42) and expert robotic surgeons (n=16) were recruited. Medical students and gamers were significantly faster than experts in the Flanker Task. The experts were significantly slower than the all other groups in the subsidizing task. Experts scored significantly higher, were significantly more efficient, and were significantly faster than laypeople, medical students, and gamers in the first trial of Ring & Rail 1 and Suture Sponge. In trial eight of the simulation exercises, the experts performed significantly better than most groups in all of the metrics. Contrary to prior literature in laparoscopy, this study was unable to validate enhanced abilities of video gamers in a robotic surgery simulator. This study does further demonstrate that the transfer of skills developed through video game play is relevant to the surgical technique. This may be due to the differences of the systems and how the users interact within them. In a society where video games have become an integral past time, it is important to determine the role that video games play in the perceptual and psychomotor development of users. These findings can be generalized to domains outside of medicine that utilize robotic and computer-controlled systems, speaking to the scope of the gamers' abilities and pointing to the capacity within these systems.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586262","","Surgery;Robots;Measurement;Games;Training;Rails;Cameras","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational robots;human-robot interaction;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery;virtual reality","video game experience;basic robotic skills;virtual reality robotic surgery simulator;standardized robotic surgery skill training;objective robotic surgery skill training;standardized robotic surgery skill assessment;objective robotic surgery skill assessment;surgical education;laparoscopy;video game technology;perceptual skill acquisition;psychomotor skill acquisition;computer-based perceptual tests;flanker compatibility task;subsidizing task;multiple object tracking test;computer-controlled systems","","1","","17","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hardware advancements have enabled replication of real-world interactions in virtual environments to a large extent, paving the way for commercial grade applications that provide a safe and risk-free training environment at a fraction of the cost. But this also mandates the need to develop more intrinsic interaction techniques and to empirically evaluate them in a more comprehensive manner. Although there exists a body of previous research that examines the benefits of selected levels of interaction fidelity on performance, few studies have investigated the constituent components of fidelity in a Interaction Fidelity Continuum (IFC) with several system instances and their respective effects on performance and learning in the context of a real-world skills training application. Our work describes a large between-subjects investigation conducted over several years that utilizes bimanual interaction metaphors at six discrete levels of interaction fidelity to teach basic precision metrology concepts in a near-field spatial interaction task in VR. A combined analysis performed on the data compares and contrasts the six different conditions and their overall effects on performance and learning outcomes, eliciting patterns in the results between the discrete application points on the IFC. With respect to some performance variables, results indicate that simpler restrictive interaction metaphors and highest fidelity metaphors perform better than medium fidelity interaction metaphors. In light of these results, a set of general guidelines are created for developers of spatial interaction metaphors in immersive virtual environments for precise fine-motor skills training simulations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794639","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260967","Bimanual Interaction;Interaction Fidelity;Empirical Evaluation;Educational Virtual Reality","Training;Aerospace electronics;Solid modeling;Metrology;Mice;Virtual environments","computer based training;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","Interaction Fidelity Continuum;near-field training simulations;virtual reality applications;education;real-world interactions;safe risk-free training environment;intrinsic interaction techniques;near-field spatial interaction task;learning outcomes;discrete application points;performance variables;medium fidelity interaction metaphors;spatial interaction metaphors;immersive virtual environments;fine-motor skills training simulations;bimanual interaction metaphors;restrictive interaction metaphors;head-mounted displays;tracking technology","Adolescent;Adult;Cognition;Female;High Fidelity Simulation Training;Humans;Male;Surveys and Questionnaires;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","1","","33","Traditional","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Organ textures can greatly affect visual realism and hence the overall quality of the simulation. In this paper, we use a very simple algorithm that can efficiently synthesize a wide variety of organ textures. The algorithm uses pixel-based texture synthesize technology. For each pixel in the output image, an L-shaped neighborhood of current pixel of a specific size is considered. Each pixel from this neighborhood generates a ¿shifted¿ candidate pixel according to its original position in the input texture. The best pixel is chosen with a neighborhood most similar to the current L-shaped neighborhood in the output image. This method is fast and its implementation is straightforward.

To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view videos. Our method learns a general skill embedding independently from the task context by using an adversarial loss. We combine a metric learning loss, which utilizes temporal video coherence to learn a state representation, with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill-transfer loss. The metric learning loss learns a disentangled representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. The adversarial skill-transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains. We show that the learned embedding enables training of continuous control policies to solve novel tasks that require the interpolation of previously seen skills. Our extensive evaluation with both simulation and real world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in learning transferable skills from unlabeled interaction videos and composing them for new tasks.

However, when developing tools for rehabilitation, it is essential to design interventions that will be most effective for generalizing to the real world. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors facilitate transfer from HMD-VR to non-HMD-VR environments. Here we used a well-established test of skilled motor learning, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), to train healthy individuals in an HMD-VR environment. We examined whether learned motor skills transferred to a more conventional (non-HMD-VR) environment and what factors facilitated transfer. Our results suggest that on average, learned motor skills from this task transfer from an immersive virtual environment to a conventional environment; however, some individuals did not transfer the learned motor skills. We then examined individual differences between those that did show transfer and those that did not. We found that individuals who had previous exposure to HMD-VR were more likely to transfer their learned motor skills than those who did not. Individual differences in previous exposure to HMD-VR environments prior to training may serve as a predictor to whether learned motor skills will transfer out of HMD-VR.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994345","head-mounted virtual reality;skilled motor learning;transfer","","biomechanics;helmet mounted displays;learning (artificial intelligence);patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","HMD-VR environment;learned motor skills;head-mounted virtual reality;HMD-VR motor skills;motor rehabilitation;nonHMD-VR environments;skilled motor learning;immersive virtual environment","","","","9","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is often impossible to build an ideal simulator that perfectly mimics the haptic experience of a surgical procedure, but by focussing on the aspects of the experience that are perceptually salient we can build simulators that effectively instill learning. We propose a general method for the design of surgical simulators that augment the perceptually salient aspects of an interaction. Using this method, we can increase skill-transfer rates without requiring expensive improvements in the capability of the rendering hardware or the computational complexity of the simulation. In this paper, we present our decomposition-based method for surgical simulator design, and describe a user-study comparing the training effectiveness of a haptic-search-task simulator designed using our method versus an unaugmented simulator. The results show that perception-based task decomposition can be used to improve the design of surgical simulators that effectively impart skill by targeting perceptually significant aspects of the interaction.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2011.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975145","Haptic I/O;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;life and medical sciences;surgical simulation.","Haptic interfaces;Surgery;Training;Needles;Rendering (computer graphics);Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","augmented reality;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;surgery","perceptually augmented simulator design;training simulator;air-traffic control;piloting;nuclear power station monitoring;surgical simulator;low-level muscle-memory;surgical procedure;haptic experience;salient interaction aspect;skill-transfer rate;rendering hardware;computational complexity;decomposition-based method;user study;haptic-search-task simulator;unaugmented simulator;perception-based task decomposition","","2","","21","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mnemonics is a technique for memorizing a number of unstructured items that has been known for more than two millennia and was used in ancient Greece. Although its utility is remarkable, acquiring the skill to take advantage of mnemonics is generally difficult. In this study we propose a new method of increasing the effectiveness of classic mnemonics by facilitating the process of memorizing and applying mnemonics. The spatial electronic mnemonics (SROM) proposed here is partly based on an ancient technique that utilizes locations and images that reflect the characteristics of human memory. We first present the design of the SROM as a working hypothesis that augments traditional mnemonics using a portable computer. Then an augmented virtual memory peg (vMPeg) that incorporates a graphic numeral and a photograph of a location is introduced as a first implementation for generating a vMPeg. In an experiment, subjects exhibited remarkable retention of the vMPegs over a long interval. The second phase of placing items to remember on a generated vMPeg was also examined in a preliminary experiment, which also indicated good subject performance. In addition to evaluating the SROM by anylysing the scores for correct recall, a subjective evaluation was performed to investigate the nature of the SROM.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-1971-5","10.1109/VR.2008.4480777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4480777","Memory augmentation;Wearable computer;Visual images;Space and place;VR application;H.5.m [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Miscellaneous;K.3.1 [Computer Uses in Education]: Computer-assisted instruction (CAI)","Humans;Wearable computers;Graphics;Computer aided instruction;Pervasive computing;Portable computers;Virtual reality;Application software;Computer interfaces;Electronic mail","augmented reality;neurophysiology;virtual reality;wearable computers","spatial electronic mnemonics;human memory augmentation;wearable devices;smartphone devices;portable computer;augmented virtual memory peg;vMPeg;SROM","","2","","14","","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, cognitive skills are highly demanded for novice surgeons to thoroughly interpret the relative positions between tool and tissue in images and make appropriate decisions about further catheter motions in case of collisions. In this paper, an operator's cognitive skills training system has been introduced, which exploits the tactile sensation to reinforce the visualized spatial positions between catheter tip and vascular wall in the VR simulator. In cooperation with the collision alert module (CAM) in the VR simulator, the newly developed catheter manipulator can provide tactile sensations for novices when catheter tip is threaded beyond safety boundary, so that the VR exhibited tool-tissue interaction can be deliberately intensified. For demonstrating such tactile sensations adequate to strengthen visions, the system model has been established to facilitate the analysis in the perspective of operator's kinesthetic perception. A series of experiments have been conducted at last and the results reveal that the catheter manipulator can not only realize the accurate catheter motions but also provide the enough tactile sensations for novices. Moreover, statistical data prove that subjects under cognitive trainings have developed the ability to interpret the relative spatial positions between catheter tip and vascular wall. Such findings support that the operator's cognitive skills can be enhanced by the tactile reinforcement of VR visualized tool-tissue interaction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982219","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9043517","Catheterization training system;cognitive skills;tactile sensation;VR simulator;collision detection","Catheters;Training;Surgery;Haptic interfaces;Force;Manipulators","catheters;cognition;haptic interfaces;manipulators;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery;touch (physiological);virtual reality","statistical data;operator kinesthetic perception;operator cognitive skill training system;operator cognitive skill enhancement;VR visualized tool-tissue interaction;tactile reinforcement;relative spatial positions;cognitive trainings;catheter motions;system model;catheter manipulator;collision alert module;VR simulator;vascular wall;catheter tip;visualized spatial positions;novice surgeons;collision force perceptions;introducer sheath;haptic forces;visual feedback;experienced surgeons;clinical vascular interventional surgery;tactile sensation assisted VR catheterization training system","","","","32","CCBY","20 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

A set of driving stimuli, including braking on sudden appearance of bumpers, steering control at the sharp bending points, and the like, are prepared to experimentally classify the learning skill of the subjects in three distinct classes: Low, Medium and High. The complexity in classifying the subjective learning-skill arises because of intra- and inter-session variations in brain signals due to temporal fluctuation in activation levels of the involved brain lobes. A novel z-slice based model of general type-2 fuzzy set is proposed to represent the intra- and inter-session variations by the footprint of uncertainty and their composite variations by z-slices at different values of a given feature. Further, a novel technique for z-slice based classifier is proposed to classify the learning-skill under intra-and inter-session uncertainty. The proposed classifier is found to outperform traditional and well-known type-2 classifiers for the present learning-skill classification task in Experiments undertaken confirm the frontal and parietal theta (4-7 Hz) activation in discrete learning steps.

Analysis of typical missions such as mine countermeasures and search/salvage yielded a set of general skills to be taught including manoeuvring, situational awareness, sensor data integration, and mission operations. Use of VE technology permits the creation of an enriched learning environment including simulation of a wide range of operational environments, vehicle configurations, learning aids, rind mission scenarios. The prototype training system is a VE-based Intelligent Tutor which implements various training aids and interventions to promote the development of both the sensorimotor and cognitive skills related to basic manoeuvring tasks and situational awareness.

Achieving broad generalization typically requires large datasets, which are difficult to obtain for task-specific interactive processes such as reinforcement learning or learning from demonstration. However, much of the visual diversity in the world can be captured through passively collected datasets of images or videos. In our method, which we refer to as GPLAC (Generalized Policy Learning with Attentional Classifier), we use both interaction data and weakly labeled image data to augment the generalization capacity of sensorimotor policies. Our method combines multitask learning on action selection and an auxiliary binary classification objective, together with a convolutional neural network architecture that uses an attentional mechanism to avoid distractors. We show that pairing interaction data from just a single environment with a diverse dataset of weakly labeled data results in greatly improved generalization to unseen environments, and show that this generalization depends on both the auxiliary objective and the attentional architecture that we propose. We demonstrate our results in both simulation and on a real robotic manipulator, and demonstrate substantial improvement over standard convolutional architectures and domain adaptation methods.","2380-7504","978-1-5386-1032-9","10.1109/ICCV.2017.623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8237885","","Robot sensing systems;Visualization;Standards;Computer vision;Manipulators","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;robot vision","GPLAC;generalizing vision;robotic skills;robotic sensorimotor control policies;unseen environments;broad generalization;task-specific interactive processes;reinforcement learning;visual diversity;passively collected datasets;images;videos;Generalized Policy Learning;Attentional Classifier;weakly labeled image data;generalization capacity;sensorimotor policies;multitask learning;auxiliary binary classification objective;convolutional neural network architecture;attentional mechanism;pairing interaction data;diverse dataset;weakly labeled data results;auxiliary objective;attentional architecture;robotic manipulator;standard convolutional architectures;domain adaptation methods;generalization;action selection","","5","","55","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulator incorporates five contact pressure sensors located in key anatomical landmarks. Two 32-state fully connected MMs are used, one for each skill level. Each state corresponds to a unique five-dimensional signature of contact pressures. Statistical distances measured between models representing subjects with different skill levels are sensitive enough to provide an objective measure of medical skill level. The method was tested with 41 expert subjects and 41 novice subjects in addition to the 30 subjects used for training the MM. Of the 82 subjects, 76 (92%) were classified correctly.

Exploration in real world is, however, inherently unsafe and time consuming, and causes wear and tear. To address these, learning policies in simulation and then transferring them to physical systems has been proposed. In this letter, we propose a novel sample-efficient transfer approach, which is agnostic to the dynamics of a simulated system and combines it with incremental learning. Instead of transferring a single control policy, we transfer a generalizable contextual policy generated in simulation using one or few samples from real world to a target global model, which can generate policies across parameterized real-world situations. We studied the generalization capability of the incremental transfer framework using MuJoCo physics engine and KUKA LBR 4+. Experiments with ball-in-a-cup and basketball tasks demonstrated that the target model improved the generalization capability beyond the direct use of the source model indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experiments also indicated that the transfer capability depends on the generalization capability of the corresponding source model, similarity between source and target environment, and number of samples used for transferring.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2900768","Academy of Finland, decision; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648230","Learning and Adaptive Systems;Model Learning for Control","Task analysis;Adaptation models;Context modeling;Databases;Uncertainty;Robots;Friction","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;robot dynamics;robots;rolling friction","target global model;policies;generalization capability;incremental transfer framework;MuJoCo physics engine;KUKA LBR 4;target model;transfer capability;target environment;reinforcement learning;robots;autonomous learning framework;skill;wear;physical systems;simulated system;incremental learning;single control policy;generalizable contextual policy;source model;sample-efficient transfer approach;generalizable motor primitives","","4","","21","CCBY","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Seeing that complex learning environments can foster the development of various cognitive abilities, like multiperspective reasoning skills (MPRS), such design principles are highly desirable. Using multiperspective hypermedia environments (MHEs) as a testbed, the presented project aims to identify and evaluate design principles, derived from cognitive science. We will create and study interactive, immersive 3D-interface to MHEs using virtual reality technology. To evaluate the developed system, we will contrast the acquisition of MPRS in 2D and 3D learning environments.

Two of the earliest indicators of potential neurocognitive problems are motor and visual dysfunction. Motor disorders and problems in visual cognition can be seen in many neurocognitive disorders, resulting in abnormal physical reactions to visual stimuli. Analyzing physical behaviors when presented with such stimuli can provide insights into the visual perception and motor abilities of an individual, yet there is currently no unbiased, objective, general-purpose tool that analyzes attention and motor behavior to assess neurocognitive function. We propose a novel method of neurocognitive function assessment that tests the patient's cognition using virtual reality with eye tracking and motion analysis. By placing the patient in a controlled virtual environment and analyzing their movements, we can evoke certain physical responses from subjects for neurocognitive assessment. We have developed a prototype system that places the subject in a virtual baseball field and captures their full body motion as they try to catch baseballs. This scenario tests the subject's ability to determine the landing time and position of the ball, as well as the test subject's balance, motor skills, attention, and memory. Preliminary tests with 20 healthy normal individuals demonstrate the ability of this tool to assess the test subject's balance, memory, attention, and reaction to visual stimuli. This platform has a twofold contribution: it is used to assess several neurocognitive constructs that affect visual and motor capability neutrally and objectively based on controlled stimuli, and it enables objective comparison between different neurocognitive disorders research in this field.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2881455","Comcast Media and Technology Center; CU Denver ORS; Department of Education GAANN Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536376","Behavioral analysis;motor skills;neurocognitive assessment;virtual reality;visual cognition","Visualization;Tools;Sports;Tracking;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality","brain;cognition;gaze tracking;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;virtual reality;visual perception","neurocognitive function assessment;virtual reality;eye tracking;motion analysis;controlled virtual environment;physical responses;virtual baseball field;visual stimuli;motor capability;behavioral response analysis;visual dysfunction;motor disorders;visual cognition;visual perception;motor behavior;physical behaviors;neurocognitive problems","Adult;Aged;Cognition;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Psychomotor Performance;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","1","","58","Traditional","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most importantly, will patients be able to generalize in three critical ways: (1) to unpracticed directions, (2) to unpracticed movement distances, and (3) to unpracticed weight-eliminated conditions? Rather than presuming that patients could generalize in three conditions, this study tested whether there was any evidence of such generalization ability in healthy individuals. We found that there was some evidence in all conditions except for the ability of healthy subjects to generalize to large movements after practicing small. Such results suggest that larger robotic systems are advantageous for training the functional motions that can include large actions.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627308","","Training;Gravity;Visualization;Virtual reality;Performance evaluation;Robot sensing systems","medical robotics;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;robot kinematics;virtual reality","skill generalization;robotic neuro-rehabilitation;upper limb extremity rehabilitation;robotic interaction;repetitive practice;unpracticed directions;unpracticed movement distances;unpracticed weight-eliminated condition","Activities of Daily Living;Adult;Algorithms;Arm Injuries;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;Male;Motor Activity;Movement;Movement Disorders;Nervous System;Robotics;Upper Extremity","","","19","","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgical performance. The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene. Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance. The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons. An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training. The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis. The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing. Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.869771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597490","Dynamics;haptics;human machine interface;kinematics;manipulation;Markov model;minimally invasive;robotics;simulation;soft tissue;surgery;surgical skill assessment;surgical tool;vector quantization","Minimally invasive surgery;Stochastic processes;Kinematics;Performance analysis;Multidimensional systems;Information analysis;Information resources;Layout;Animal structures;Protocols","surgery;Markov processes;endoscopes;medical robotics;virtual reality;robot kinematics","minimally invasive surgery;stochastic process;discrete Markov model;visual information;surgical tool kinematics;surgical tool dynamics;Blue DRAGON;endoscopic tools;finite state model;objective learning curve;subjective performance analysis;laparoscopic suturing;surgical robots;virtual reality simulators","Computer Simulation;Endoscopes;Endoscopy;Expert Systems;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Markov Chains;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Robotics;Robotics;Stochastic Processes;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive;Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface","160","3","47","","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current VR accessibility applications have been developed either on expensive head-mounted displays or with extra accessories and mechanisms, which are either not accessible or inconvenient for BVI individuals. In this paper, we present a mobile VR app that enables BVI users to access a virtual environment on an iPhone in order to build their skills of perception and recognition of the virtual environment and the virtual objects in the environment. The app uses the iPhone on a selfie stick to simulate a long cane in VR, and applies Augmented Reality (AR) techniques to track the iPhone's real-time poses in an empty space of the real world, which is then synchronized to the long cane in the VR environment. Due to the use of mixed reality (the integration of VR & AR), we call it the Mixed Reality cane (MR Cane), which provides BVI users auditory and vibrotactile feedback whenever the virtual cane comes in contact with objects in VR. Thus, the MR Cane allows BVI individuals to interact with the virtual objects and identify approximate sizes and locations of the objects in the virtual environment. We performed preliminary user studies with blind-folded participants to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed mobile approach and the results indicate that the proposed MR Cane could be effective to help BVI individuals in understanding the interaction with virtual objects and exploring 3D virtual environments. The MR Cane concept can be extended to new applications of navigation, training and entertainment for BVI individuals without more significant efforts.","","978-1-7281-7675-8","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct51615.2020.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288373","Virtual Reality;Mixed Reality;Visually Impaired;Spatial Exploration","Training;Visualization;Navigation;Virtual environments;Tools;Space exploration;Augmented reality","augmented reality;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces;helmet mounted displays;mobile computing","3D virtual environment;blind and visually impaired;virtual reality;BVI;mobile VR app;virtual objects;augmented reality;VR environment;mixed reality cane;VR accessibility applications;MR cane;head-mounted displays;vibrotactile feedback;auditory feedback","","","","24","","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, clinicians find too few abnormalities and have variable rates of detection, due in part to the inadequacy of training simulators. The Virginia Prostate Examination Simulator (VPES) was designed, built, and tested to address the inadequacies of current simulators by incorporating the design requirements of the basic elements of accurate anatomy, multiple and reconfigurable scenarios of graded difficulty, and technique and performance feedback. We compared the training effectiveness of the VPES with two commercial simulators in an experiment of 36 medical and nurse practitioner students.

Upon closer analysis, however, the following key patterns emerge: 1) Across all types of training, more deficiencies lie in skill-based rather than rule-based decision making, which improves only for VPES trainees; 2) only VPES training transfers both to other simulators and previously unencountered scenarios; 3) visual feedback may increase the number of abnormalities reported yet hinder the ability to discriminate; and 4) applied finger pressure did not correlate with the ability to identify abnormalities.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2009769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4729621","Evaluation;haptics;medical;nursing;simulation;simulator;tactile;training","Physics computing;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Medical simulation;Testing;Feedback;Prostate cancer;Blood;Joining processes;Diseases","cancer;digital simulation;medical diagnostic computing","computerized simulator;physical simulator;clinical prostate exams;prostate cancer screening;prostate specific antigen blood test;digital rectal examination;disease diagnosis;training simulators;Virginia prostate examination simulator;accurate anatomy;decision making;VPES trainees;visual feedback","","24","","57","","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

VR simulation training allows users to gain new skills and apply them to real-life situations. However, the learning curve of this technology from a novice level could influence the expected learning results of a training session. A training approach based on the combination of VR and gamification could speed up this overall learning process and not just for a novice. In this paper we evaluate how gamification in a VR training session can improve the efficiency of the training and the accuracy of the task execution in a real-world practical test. In the training scenario of this study, 50 randomly assigned participants were divided into two groups. The groups were assigned to a gamified and a non-gamified version of the same VR training and were then guided through a step-by-step tutorial outlining how to solve an assembly task. Performance differences were evaluated based on time taken and specific errors made during the training session. The results of this study show, in general, that beneficial effects can be attributed to the use of gamification in the conducted VR training simulation, particularly for the VR novice participants.","2474-0489","978-1-7281-4540-2","10.1109/VS-Games.2019.8864583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864583","virtual training;virtual reality;gamification;training;learning transfer;assembly task","Training;Task analysis;Games;Tutorials;Solid modeling;Augmented reality","computer based training;computer simulation;serious games (computing);virtual reality","VR simulation training;learning curve;novice level;gamification;learning process;VR training session;task execution;virtual reality training assembly task","","3","","44","","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We parametrize our primitives as cyclic movements, improving sample-efficiency of learning from scratch on a 18 degrees of freedom robot. Then, we learn coarse dynamics models over primitive cycles and use them in a model predictive control framework. This allows us to learn to walk to arbitrary goals up to 12m away, after about two hours of training from scratch on hardware.

Even before its fundamental origin, the mathematical branch of system dynamics led to pioneering advances in research, technology and business. Today, virtual reality has become a mainstream technique for employee training. The combination of augmented and virtual reality technologies along with traditional methods of simulation has led to the development of a new powerful instrument of learning applied to complex systems. Our work is the first step of an ambitious project which aims to reinforce the Statistical Thinking of undergraduate students at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. Using virtual reality and numerical simulation methods our project connects processes and statistics. The student faces the challenge to solve a process problem, which is presented in a first step as a 3D video. By using virtual reality, we expect to develop strong and soft skills in our students enhanced by what we call the five S linked by the five C: Scope-Strategy-Standard-Seamless and Success with Choice-Collaboration-Communication-Critical-Thinking and Creativity. We have measured the impact of using this strategy on student learning. For the last two semesters the outcome has been positive for our learning model, in both quantitative and qualitative variables. We have carried out a parametric hypotheses test, comparing the mean grades obtained in a similar final exam, by students having followed our new method with those having a traditional learning method.

In an effort to remedy such delay, analysis of data passively captured from user's interaction with consumer technologies has been recently explored towards remote screening of early PD motor signs. In the current study, a smartphone-based method analyzing subjects' finger interaction with the smartphone screen is developed for the quantification of fine-motor skills decline in early PD using Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results from the analysis of keystroke typing in-the-clinic data from 18 early PD patients and 15 healthy controls have shown a classification performance of 0.89 Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 0.79/0.79 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. Evaluation of the generalization ability of the proposed approach was made by its application on typing data arising from a separate self-reported cohort of 27 PD patients' and 84 healthy controls' daily usage with their personal smartphones (data in-the-wild), achieving 0.79 AUC with 0.74/0.78 sensitivity/specificity, respectively.

Once the user successfully completes the different levels of this serious game, he can then 'graduate' to operate an actual crane. Serious games are proven method of cost effective and risk free simulated environments where a player can learn all the nuances of any simulated activity, herein operating a crane. We implemented a learning methodology, Gagne's 9 Events of Learning, in order to ensure the player develops a high level of understanding. We used an actual crane as a reference model (Ace14XW) for this game.

"Co-presentation of force cues for skill transfer via shared-control systems","D. Powell; M. K. O'Malley","Rice University, USA; Rice University, USA","2010 IEEE Haptics Symposium","8 Apr 2010","2010","","","453","456","During training and rehabilitation with haptic devices, it is often necessary to simultaneously present force cues arising from different haptic models (such as guidance cues and environmental forces). Multiple force cues are typically summed to produce a single output force, which conveys only relative information about the original force cues and may not be useful to trainees. Two force co-presentation paradigms are proposed as potential solutions to this problem: temporal separation of force cues, where one type of force is overlaid with the other in staggered pulses, and spatial separation, where the forces are presented via multiple haptic devices. A generalized model for separating task and guidance forces in a virtual environment is also proposed. In a pilot study where sixteen participants were trained in a dynamic target-hitting task using these co-presentation paradigms, simple summation was in fact most effective at eliciting skill transfer in most respects. Spatial separation imposed the lowest overall workload on participants, however, and might thus be more appropriate than summation in tasks with other significant physical or mental demands. Temporal separation was relatively inferior at eliciting skill transfer, but it is hypothesized that this paradigm would have performed considerably better in a non-rhythmic task, and the need for further research is indicated.","2324-7355","978-1-4244-6822-5","10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444619","","Haptic interfaces;Virtual environment;Fixtures;Education;Performance evaluation;Manipulator dynamics;Displays;USA Councils;Force control;Feedback","haptic interfaces;virtual reality","force cues;skill transfer;shared-control systems;haptic devices;guidance cues;environmental forces;virtual environment;copresentation paradigms","","1","","7","","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this paper is to present a learning environment based on augmented reality, which can be used both by teachers to develop quality AR educational resources and by students to acquire knowledge in an area. Common problems teachers have in applying AR have been taken into account by producing an authoring tool for education which includes the following characteristics: (1) the ability to incorporate diverse multimedia resources such as video, sound, images and 3D objects in an easy manner, 2) the ability to incorporate tutored descriptions into elements which are being displayed (thus, the student is provided with an additional information, description or narrative about the resource, while the content gets adapted and personalized), (3) the possibility for the teacher to incorporate multiple choice questions (MCQ) into the virtual resource (useful for instant feedback to students on their understanding, it can be useful for the student to know what are the most important points of that issue and for the teacher to assess whether the student distinguishes different concepts) and (4) a library of virtual content where all resources are available in a simple and transparent way for any user. In this study ARLE is used to add AR technologies into notes or books created by the teacher, thereby supplementing both the theoretical and practical content without any programming skills needed on the designers' behalf. In addition to presenting system architecture and the examples of its educational use, a survey concerning use of AR amongst teachers in Spain has been conducted.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044039","augmented reality;learning environment;mobile learning;authoring tools","Augmented reality;Education;Three-dimensional displays;Licenses;Mobile communication;Programming profession","augmented reality;mobile learning;multimedia computing","learning environment;augmented reality mobile learning;augmented reality activities;AR activities;3D objects;AR tools;virtual content;AR educational resources;authoring tool;multimedia resources;multiple choice questions;MCQ;virtual resource","","6","","33","","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A viewpoint change function is desirable when a learner observes the actions using video images. However, in general, viewpoint changes for observation are not possible because most videos are filmed from a fixed point using a single video camera. The objective of this research is to develop a method that generates a 3D human model of a player (i.e., a virtual player) from a single image and enable observation of the virtual player's action from any point of view.

It can simulate the surgery from the visual, auditory, and tactile aspects. VR medical simulator can greatly reduce the risk of the real patient and the cost of hospitals. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the typical representatives in minimal invasive surgery (MIS). Due to the large incidence of cholecystectomy, the application of its VR-based simulation is vital and necessary for the residents' surgical training. In this paper, we present a VR simulation framework based on position-based dynamics (PBD) for cholecystectomy. To further accelerate the deformation of organs, PBD constraints are solved in parallel by a graph coloring algorithm. We introduce a bio-thermal conduction model to improve the realism of the fat tissue electrocautery. Finally, we design a hybrid multi-model connection method to handle the interaction and simulation of the liver-gallbladder separation. This simulation system has been applied to laparoscopic cholecystectomy training in several hospitals. From the experimental results, users can operate in real-time with high stability and fidelity. The simulator is also evaluated by a number of digestive surgeons through preliminary studies. They believed that the system can offer great help to the improvement of surgical skills.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-5608-8","10.1109/VR46266.2020.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089572","Human-centered computing—Human computer interaction—Interactive systems and tools—User interface programming;Computer systems organization—Real-time systems—Real- time system architecture","Surgery;Biological system modeling;Strain;Biological tissues;Image color analysis;Deformable models;Solid modeling","biological tissues;computer based training;graphics processing units;liver;medical computing;surgery;virtual reality","minimal invasive surgery;VR-based simulation;PBD constraints;graph coloring algorithm;hybrid multimodel connection method;laparoscopic cholecystectomy;parallel position-based dynamics;virtual reality based training;visual aspects;tactile aspects;VR medical simulator;GPU;auditory aspects;biothermal conduction model;fat tissue electrocautery;liver-gallbladder separation","","","","30","","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The social communication skill was the highly targeted skill, and individuals with ASD were part of all the studies. Computer, smartphone, and smartglass are more frequently used technologies. The commonly used research design was pre-test and post-test. Almost all the studies used observation as a data collection method, and classroom environment or controlled research environment were used as a setting of evaluation. Most of the evaluation parameters were human-assisted. The results of the studies show that AR benefited children with ASD in learning skills. The generalization test was conducted in one study only, but the results were not reported. The results of maintenance tests conducted in five studies during a short-term period following the withdrawal of intervention were positive. Although the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching or learning of skills related to ASD based on the existing literature is not possible.

Whereas lots of AR-based self-learning support systems have been developed in previous studies, it has not been sufficiently evaluated how it influences a learner's mindset and the efficiency of training. In this paper, we investigate the user experience brought by AR technologies in a self-learning process. We chose the game of Go as a study program, and developed the Augmented Reality Go (ARGo) system to compare the AR and conventional PC-based learning assistance. We found that the physical interaction with the original game apparatus enhanced the subjects' intrinsic motivation towards self-learning.

This model has achieved reliable performance in areas such as human-robot collaboration and dual-arm manipulation. However, the crucial task frames and associated parameters in this learning framework are often set by the human teacher, which renders three problems that have not been addressed yet: (i) task frames are treated equally, without considering their individual importance, (ii) task parameters are defined without taking into account additional task constraints, such as robot joint limits and motion smoothness, and (iii) a fixed number of task frames are pre-defined regardless of whether some of them may be redundant or even irrelevant for the task at hand. In this paper, we generalize the task-parameterized learning by addressing the aforementioned problems.

While this signifies numerous opportunities for students, it also inherently involves the challenge of preparing students suitably for these opportunities. Students, especially those at the beginner level, encounter difficulties when learning to program and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect students' motivation. Over time, this creates to a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming', which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts.

Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter training-scenarios development times and reuse of existing engineering models. In addition, by using computer based virtual reality (VR) training systems, the time span from the product design to commercial production can be shortened due to non-reliance on hardware parts. Within the aforementioned conceptual framework, a haptically enabled interactive and immersive virtual reality (HIIVR) system is presented. Unlike existing VR systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations of the real world imposed by the haptics devices within the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VR systems, capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in procedural learning and procedural skill development as well, due to its high physically interactive nature.","2154-4824","978-1-889335-38-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699035","Haptics;virtual assembly;interactive and immersive","Virtual reality;Virtual prototyping;Assembly;Industrial training;Computer aided manufacturing;Manufacturing industries;Costs;Design engineering;Product design;Production systems","assembling;computer based training;haptic interfaces;industrial training;production engineering computing;virtual reality","haptically enabled interactive virtual reality prototype;general assembly;manufacturing industries;computer-based virtual reality training systems;immersive virtual reality","","","","9","","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Corp., Cary, NC, USA; NA","Proceedings of Winter Simulation Conference","6 Aug 2002","1994","","","1296","1303","In attempting to reach a larger, less technical audience, one of the most debated topics in simulation has been how to effectively bridge the gap between the flexibility and detail available in general purpose simulation languages, and the ease of use, simplicity and more limited modeling skills required of data-driven simulators. Many vendors have promoted the concept of ""templates"", user-defined, reusable pieces of model code that are object or object-like building blocks. Building blocks are a great time saving concept, however, this leaves one large assumption unaddressed: that the template user can accurately define the logic to link the building blocks together. Trained analysts with time constraints can greatly benefit from modeling templates, but less technical users still have a huge risk of creating inaccurate models. If, instead of a template, a more focused, generic model (Focused Application Simulator and Trainer, FAST) is constructed, it is possible to build in additional levels of pre-defined logic and data consistency control. This paper presents a brief literature review of Dual Resource Constrained (DRC) systems and task assignment (movement decision) rules for cross-trained operators. These concepts have been incorporated into a FAST model that includes a non-programming way to define the decision making for production line balancing, and an interactive, simulation-based training method for teaching operators and supervisors the rules they are expected to follow.","","0-7803-2109-X","10.1109/WSC.1994.717522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=717522","","Decision making;Production systems;Industrial training;Productivity;Control systems;Textile technology;Bridges;Logic;Risk analysis;Time factors","simulation languages;digital simulation;software reusability;data integrity;decision support systems;computer integrated manufacturing","focused application simulator;flexible decision making;simulation;general purpose simulation languages;modeling skills;data-driven simulators;templates;model code reuse;object-like building blocks;time constraints;modeling templates;generic model;Focused Application Simulator and Trainer;FAST;data consistency control;Dual Resource Constrained systems;task assignment;production line balancing;simulation-based training method;teaching","","3","3","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, a majority of previous studies have found that haptic guidance is ineffective, or sometimes even detrimental, to motor skill learning. In this paper, we propose the opposite concept, haptic disturbance, and evaluate its efficacy. In haptic disturbance, haptic cues that interfere with the movements of a learner are presented during training. We designed two methods of haptic disturbance using repulsive and noise-like forces, respectively. The effects of these methods were experimentally assessed, comparatively with the conventional methods of visual learning only and progressive haptic guidance. The motor task was to track a dot moving on a 2D plane with a haptic interface operated with one arm. We found that during training, the progressive haptic guidance showed the best tracking accuracy, but in immediate and delayed retention tests, the noise-like haptic disturbance led to the best performance. The results suggest high potentials for haptic disturbance to be a general strategy for expediting the motor learning process.","2324-7355","978-1-4244-6822-5","10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444635","","Haptic interfaces;Feedback;Testing;Virtual reality;Humans;Computer graphics;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Laboratories;Computer science","computer based training;graphical user interfaces;haptic interfaces;human factors","haptic guidance;haptic disturbance;human motor skill learning;haptic cues;repulsive force;noise like force","","65","","36","","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These factors contribute to decreased autonomy during the chief residency year, which creates a wider distribution of skills among graduating residents. While hospital administrators are concerned with quality assurance, patient safety, and cost reduction, patients continue to increase their expectations and awareness of surgeons' skills. To address the concerns of both employees and patients, it is important to ensure that residents are adequately prepared to perform surgery. The University of Virginia Health System does not use a standardized method to evaluate residents' readiness to perform all necessary surgical skills before graduating. Our research into performance metrics contributes to this end goal: the automation of the resident evaluation process. We have hypothesized a series of key performance metrics that are transferrable from the testing laboratory to the operating room. This research included basic task element analysis based on twenty-nine videos of novice residents and surgical experts performing vessel ligation on a bench-top simulator. Additional data was collected from ten first-year residents performing vessel ligations for the first time while wearing inertial sensors and eye-tracking goggles. The residents' data was examined from physical and cognitive performance perspectives, with metrics including time, hand movements, and visual gaze behaviors. The cross-examination of novice and expert data is essential for the furtherance of metric development that will ultimately lead to automated evaluation.","","978-1-5386-1848-6","10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937702","Simulation;Resident Evaluation;Surgical Readiness;Vessel Ligation","Surgery;Measurement;Videos;Sensors;Visualization;Training;Cameras","biomechanics;force sensors;gaze tracking;safety;surgery","surgeon performance;simulation-based training;general surgery residency;quality assurance;patient safety;cost reduction;surgical skill;vessel ligation;inertial sensor;eye-tracking goggle;physical performance perspective;cognitive performance perspective;hand movements;visual gaze behavior","","","","5","","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation and visual realism provide training situations very close to practice with real systems while reducing cost and with greater safety. Furthermore, VR offers the possibility of change time or space scales, visualize from different perspectives, experience inaccessible real environments, all under the user's control, without risks, at her own pace. This allows to develop skills and to have confidence to work thereafter in real conditions with real equipment. Interaction technologies are now more widely available and affordable. But generally devices are conceived for “standard” people leaving behind people with impairments and further accentuating the digital gap. In this paper, we present our work in the development of an accessible wheelchair simulator designed to allow children with multiple disabilities to familiarize themselves with the wheelchair, and practitioners to better understand children capabilities.","","978-1-5386-7592-2","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2018.00107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8699276","virtual reality;simulator;disability;multiple disabilities;wheelchair;learning;augmented and alternative communication;interaction devices;I.3.1 [Computer Graphics]: Hardware Architecture — Input devices;I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism – Virtual reality;H.5.1 [Information Interfaces And Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems — Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities;H.5.2 [Information Interfaces And Presentation]: User Interfaces — Input devices and strategies","Wheelchairs;Virtual reality;Tools;Solid modeling;Visualization;Games;Adaptation models","computer based training;computer simulation;handicapped aids;virtual reality;wheelchairs","accessibility conditions;VR;visual realism;interaction technologies;accessible wheelchair simulator;virtual reality wheelchair simulator;children with multiple disabilities","","","","12","","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter times for the development of different training-scenarios as well as reuse of existing designed engineering (math) models. This paper presents a newly developed virtual environment (VE) for training of procedure tasks i.e. object assembly. Unlike existing VE systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations of the real world. These physical constrains are imposed by the haptics devices in the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VE systems that are capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in cognitive learning and procedural skill development due to its high physically interactive nature. In addition a novel evaluation framework has also been proposed to evaluate system efficacy through a large scale of user-testing, which is often been neglected by design experts in the field of VEs. Results confirm the practical significance of evaluating a VE design by involving sample of real and representative users through the effective discovery of critical usability problems and system deficiencies. Results also indicate benefits of collecting multimodal information for accurate and comprehensive assessment of system efficacy. Evaluation results and improvement of existing design are also presented.","","978-1-4244-4217-1","10.1109/HAVE.2009.5356130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356130","Virtual environment;Training;User-ecntred evaluation;Performance;Perception;Memory","Virtual environment;Assembly systems;Industrial training;Haptic interfaces;Manufacturing industries;Costs;Usability;Computer aided manufacturing;Feedback;Intelligent manufacturing systems","assembling;computer based training;haptic interfaces;human factors;industrial training;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;virtual reality","virtual environment;object assembly training;virtual training systems;manufacturing industry;user interaction;haptics devices;user-testing;user-centered evaluation;cognitive learning;procedural skill development","","7","","16","","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such systems, customers of multiple classes are routed to servers of multiple skills. In the settings we consider, each server skill is associated with a corresponding cost, and service level can either appear as a strong constraint or incur a cost. The solution we propose is based on the Stochastic Approximation (SA) approach. Since SBR models are analytically intractable in general, we use computer simulation to evaluate service-level measures. Under the assumption of convexity of the service-level as functions in staffing levels, SA provides an analytical proof of convergence, together with a rate of convergence. We show, via numerical examples, that although the convexity assumption does not hold for all cases and all types of service-level objectives, the algorithm nevertheless identifies the optimal solution.","1558-4305","978-1-4244-9865-9","10.1109/WSC.2010.5679022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679022","","Optimization;Stochastic processes;Servers;Analytical models;Approximation methods;Delay;Convergence","approximation theory;call centres;quality of service;stochastic processes;telecommunication network routing","simulation-based stochastic approximation;skills-based-routing;systems staffing optimization;computer simulation;service-level measurement;service-level objectives","","15","","12","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

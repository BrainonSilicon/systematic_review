The principal objective is to autonomously design an optimal controller that steers the center of the ship through a number of gates in a particular order using a minimum amount of time. In general, the steering of mobile vehicles depends on the interactions between a vehicle and its supporting medium. Nautical ships present particularly long time delays in response to rudder movements (control actions). Planning for the future encounters with gates should be part of the current control decision, since the ship's position and orientation as it moves through one gate greatly affect the ease of navigation through successive gates. The proposed adaptive critic design-based controller learns to guide the ship through a set of gates autonomously. The simulation results show the performance of the proposed approach.","2158-9860","0-7803-5665-9","10.1109/ISIC.1999.796628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=796628","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Marine vehicles;Optimal control;Turning;Neural networks;Automatic control;Function approximation;Remotely operated vehicles;Nonlinear control systems","optimal control;ships;navigation;learning systems;neurocontrollers;adaptive systems;control system synthesis;dynamic programming;discrete time systems;nonlinear control systems;time-varying systems;self-adjusting systems","adaptive critic designs;self-learning ship steering control;optimal control action sequence;optimal controller;nautical ships","","11","","16","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For ML models, we optimize the number of neurons, activation function, and number of layers. In simulation settings with perfect knowledge of system parameters and communication channels, GN-based analytical models generally outperform ANN models even though GN models are less accurate on the side channels due to the local white-noise assumption. In experimental settings, however, inaccurate knowledge of various link parameters degrades GN-based models, and ML generally estimates the QoT with better accuracy. However, ML models are temporally less stable and less generalizable to different link configurations. We also briefly study potential network capacity gains resulting from improved QoT estimators and reduced operating margins.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.410876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9336168","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Signal to noise ratio;Maximum likelihood estimation;Wavelength division multiplexing;Channel estimation;Data models","AWGN;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;telecommunication channels;telecommunication computing;wavelength division multiplexing","quality-of-transmission estimation;wavelength-division-multiplexed systems;improved QoT estimators;ANN models;GN-based analytical models;ML models;Gaussian noise model-based analytical models;artificial neural network-based machine learning models","","","","","","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem has been addressed recently by applying a matrix exponential learning (MXL) algorithm, which has a very appealing convergence rate. In this learning algorithm, however, each transmitter must know an estimate of the gradient matrix of the local utility. The knowledge of the gradient matrix at the transmitters incurs a high signaling overhead, especially that the matrix size increases with the dimension of the action matrix. In this paper, we therefore, investigate two strategies in order to decrease the informational exchange per iteration of the algorithm. In the first strategy, each receiver sends at each iteration part of the elements of the gradient matrix with respect to a certain probability. In the second strategy, each receiver feeds back “sporadically” the whole gradient matrix. We focus on the analysis of the convergence of the MXL algorithm to optimum under these two strategies. We prove that the algorithm can still converge to optimum almost surely. Upper bounds of the average convergence rate are also derived in both situations with general step-size setting, from which we can clearly see the impact of the incompleteness of the feedback information. The proposed algorithms are applied to solve the energy efficiency maximization problem in a multicarrier multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) network.

How can the ""lessons learned"" in one area of human endeavour be systematically and successfully applied to another? What is the nature of the information that permits such transfer to occur? These are important questions currently being encountered in the realm of virtual environment (VE) systems design. Applications of VE technology originally developed for use in advanced tactical aviation settings are currently being used as models for the development of neurosurgical interface concepts. While at first glance the connection between air combat and surgery may seem a distant one at best, there are many important similarities between them. For instance, both task domains share at least ten common, important human performance attributes, each of which may provide key insights into how to import knowledge gained from one domain into the other. Each of these areas have important implications for designing successful technical systems to support human performance. This paper explores the notion that general principles of interface design, derived from a concern with optimizing the above aspects of task performance, can be derived from the study of apparently disparate task domains. To illustrate this general idea, we elaborate how cross-fertilization between neurosurgery and air combat can be used to successfully advance the design of interfaces to support both.","","0-8186-8341-4","10.1109/HUICS.1998.659968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=659968","","Surgery;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Humans;Educational technology;Medical treatment;Laboratories;Virtual environment;Neurosurgery;Medical simulation","user interfaces;technology transfer;task analysis;surgery;aerospace computing;medical computing;human factors;virtual reality;military computing","human-machine interface design;task domains;human performance;virtual environment systems design;advanced tactical aviation;neurosurgical interface concepts;air combat;surgery;technical systems;task performance optimization","","1","","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigated it by means of a wrist robot coupled with a virtual reality system: kinesthetic and visual disturbances were applied during a tracking task, in a unimodal and bimodal manner, and we observed the performance. Tracking involved two degrees of freedom and the kinesthetic disturbance was applied by the robot through the third degree of freedom. Visual disturbance was provided by rotating the visual feedback.

The second element is focused on the development of a novel open source platform for automatic control, whose aim is to help to improve the educational process of the students in this area. The educational concept of the platform is based on cooperative learning methodology, in which the students collaborate with the platform design according to their needs and expectations. This methodology allowed to know initially the points of view of the students with the aim to establish the perspectives, motivations, skills and weaknesses of them in the automatic control area as well as in the different technical subareas needed in the design of the platform such as programming or signal conditioning. In agreement with the cooperative learning methodology, the construction of the platform was divided in small tasks with objectives clearly defined associated to the learning of the different educational contents in the components of hardware and software needed in the design of it. Our students interacted with each other, sharing common issues and difficulties associated with the technical behavior of the platform. This process increased the group motivation so as to find common aims both technical and human as likewise it encouraged the creativity in search of technical solutions in the design of the platform.

Recently, we notice that many researchers have applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to indoor positioning by using IMU sensor data, which sufficiently proves that the 6-dim data collected by IMU sensor contain a lot of information. In this paper, we present a ML driven method to make a regression between IMU sensor data and 2-D coordinates. To build a regression model with better generalization and lower computational complexity, this paper carries out feature extraction in the time-and time-frequency domain. The simulation run on Intel core i5-4200h shows that the method is able to suppress the drift of the inertial navigation system after a long-time travel. In comparison of GPS+IMU using extended Kalman filtering (EKF), the positioning RMS of our method on circular trajectories with a radius of 7 meters and 10.5 meters is reduced by at most 70.1% and 86.1%, respectively.","","978-1-7281-9488-2","10.1109/UCET51115.2020.9205369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205369","inertial measurement unit;machine learning;regression problem;feature extraction;indoor positioning","Feature extraction;Trajectory;Time-frequency analysis;Kalman filters;Navigation;Machine learning;Measurement units","computational complexity;feature extraction;Global Positioning System;indoor navigation;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;nonlinear filters;regression analysis;telecommunication computing;time-frequency analysis","indoor positioning;inertial measurement unit;integration process;machine learning algorithms;IMU sensor data;ML driven method;regression model;time-frequency domain;inertial navigation system;long-time travel;GPS+IMU;positioning RMS;2D coordinates;computational complexity;feature extraction;Intel core i5-4200h;extended Kalman filtering;EKF","","","","21","","29 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasing the performance of multimedia stream delivery requires overcoming many technological challenges, all of them having a direct effect on the user perceived quality of experience. The quality of experience influences in turn the quality of any e-learning process. This is as users in general and learners in particular are becoming increasingly quality-aware in their expectations. Therefore delivering a good quality video stream as a part of any e-learning process is very important. This paper proposes a new adaptive multimedia delivery algorithm which can be used in the context of e-learning. The Dynamic Quality Oriented Adaptation Scheme (D-QOAS) adapts the multimedia content sent based on both user preferences and network conditions, while adjusting dynamically its adaptation policy during delivery. Simulation results show that for different user profiles and various network conditions the improvement in end-user perceived quality is significant.

In computer-based environments, where learners interact only with a computer and do not have access to direct support from a teacher, learners need to be provided with instructional prompts or just-in-time help intended to encourage more active example processing during learning. This study investigated whether it was more beneficial to provide the learners access to on-demand (self-regulated) help after they committed an error in problem solving or for the learning environment to regulate the presentation of instructional help externally. Furthermore, two different presentational formats-textual and pictorial-of instructional prompts were examined. This study was conducted with a computer-based learning environment that introduced high school students without any prior content-specific knowledge to the principles of parallel and series circuit analysis. Textual prompts facilitated practice problem solving notably better than pictorial prompts. Overall, textual-based prompts produced a large effect on near transfer. A significant format of prompts by academic ability interaction was discovered on near transfer. In particular, lower-ability learners scored significantly better when given textual prompts; whereas, their higher-ability counterparts performed equally well with both formats. Moreover, learners provided with externally regulated prompts reported significantly more positive attitudes toward the prompts in general compared to learners in the self-regulated conditions. Finally, continuous motivation was significantly stronger in learners who viewed textual prompts than in their counterparts in the pictorial prompt groups.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2005.852602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495662","Backward fading;computer-based learning environment;electrical circuit analysis;external control;high school;instructional prompts;learner control;pictorial format;textual format","Electronics engineering education;Circuit simulation;Computer aided instruction","electronic engineering education;circuit analysis computing;computer aided instruction","instructional prompts;electrical circuit analysis;computer-based learning environment;high school students;parallel circuit analysis;series circuit analysis;textual prompts;pictorial prompts","","15","","21","","15 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose an end-to-end formulation that jointly learns to infer control parameters for grasping and throwing motion primitives from visual observations (RGB-D images of arbitrary objects in a bin) through trial and error. Within this formulation, we investigate the synergies between grasping and throwing (i.e., learning grasps that enable more accurate throws) and between simulation and deep learning (i.e., using deep networks to predict residuals on top of control parameters predicted by a physics simulator). The resulting system, TossingBot, is able to grasp and successfully throw arbitrary objects into boxes located outside its maximum reach range at 500+ mean picks per hour (600+ grasps per hour with 85% throwing accuracy); and generalizes to new objects and target locations.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2020.2988642","Google; Amazon Catalyst; Intel Corporation; NVIDIA; ABB Robotics; Mathworks; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104757","Deep learning;perception;robotic manipulation","Grasping;Aerodynamics;Visualization;Analytical models;Manipulators","aerodynamics;dexterous manipulators;learning systems;manipulator dynamics;motion control;path planning;sport","TossingBot;residual physics;robot arm;arbitrary rigid objects;physical reachability;picking speed;throwing arbitrary objects;varying object-centric properties;control parameters;grasping;throwing motion primitives;deep learning;physics simulator;throwing accuracy","","2","","43","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The GOSFNN extends the ellipsoidal basis function (EBF)-based fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) by permitting input variables to be modeled by dissymmetrical Gaussian functions (DGFs). Due to the flexibility and dissymmetry of left and right widths of the DGF, the partitioning made by DGFs in the input space is more flexible and more economical, and therefore results in a parsimonious FNN with high performance under the online learning algorithm. The geometric growing criteria and the error reduction ratio (ERR) method are used as rule growing strategies to realize the structure learning algorithm which implements an optimal and compact network structure. The proposed GOSFNN starts with no hidden neurons and does not need to partition the input space a priori. In addition, all the free parameters in premises and consequents are online adjusted by using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach. The performance of the proposed GOSFNN paradigm is compared with other well-known algorithms like OLS, RBF-AFS, DFNN, GDFNN and FAOS-PFNN, etc., on a benchmark problem in the field of nonlinear dynamic system identification.

Moreover, the DNN can take the advantages of the least squares estimation to further improve the performance of channel estimation. The DNN is first trained with simulated data in an off-line manner and then it could track the dynamic channel in an online manner. To reduce the performance degradation from random initialization, a pre-training approach is designed to refine the initial parameters of the DNN with several epochs of training. The proposed algorithm benefits from the excellent learning and generalization capability of DL and requires no prior knowledge about the channel statistics. Hence, it is more suitable for communication systems with modeling errors or non-stationary channels, such as high-mobility vehicular systems, underwater acoustic systems, and molecular communication systems.

This paper studies problems that arise when users without game-design experience relocate a Geogame. We identify common error types based on the game design documentation and recorded player data of four Geogames.

In LTE systems, different tradeoff levels can be obtained by using a proper parameterization of the Generalized Proportional Fair (GPF) scheduling rule. Our approach is able to find the best parameterization policy that maximizes the system throughput under different fairness constraints imposed by the scheduler state. The proposed method adapts and refines the policy at each Transmission Time Interval (TTI) by using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) as a non-linear function approximation between the continuous scheduler state and the optimal GPF parameter(s). The MLPNN function generalization is trained based on Continuous Actor-Critic Learning Automata Reinforcement Learning (CACLA RL). The double GPF parameterization optimization problem is addressed by using CACLA RL with two continuous actions (CACLA-2). Five reinforcement learning algorithms as simple parameterization techniques are compared against the novel technology. Simulation results indicate that CACLA-2 performs much better than any of other candidates that adjust only one scheduling parameter such as CACLA-1. CACLA-2 outperforms CACLA-1 by reducing the percentage of TTIs when the system is considered unfair. Being able to attenuate the fluctuations of the obtained policy, CACLA-2 achieves enhanced throughput gain when severe changes in the scheduling environment occur, maintaining in the same time the fairness optimality condition.","1930-529X","978-1-4799-3512-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037498","LTE-A;TTI;CQI;throughput;fairness;scheduling rule;GPF;MLPNN;RL;policy;CACLA-1;CACLA-2","Throughput;Optimal scheduling;Training;Wireless communication;Measurement;Aerospace electronics","approximation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);learning automata;Long Term Evolution;multilayer perceptrons;optimisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling","adaptive proportional fair parameterization optimization problem;LTE scheduling;continuous actor-critic reinforcement learning;system throughput maximization;user fairness satisfaction;generalized proportional fair scheduling rule;GPF scheduling rule;transmission time interval;TTI;multilayer perceptron neural network;MLPNN;nonlinear function approximation;CACLA RL","","7","","14","","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter subsystem is modeled by a differential equation. The resulting ""learning"" network is able to perform phase transitions from a fully dynamic state in which all channels are used with equal probability to a state in which each cell prefers channels which are less frequently chosen by interfering cells. Both theoretical considerations and numerical simulations show that the simple strategy to avoid interference is generally unable to provide optimum channel reuse distances.

Generally it is very difficult to acquire an accurate mechanistic model for a batch process. Therefore, empirical model based on process data attracts much attention. Because Support Vector Machine is powerful for the data-driven modeling problems characterized by small samples, nonlinearity, high dimension and local minima, support vector regression model was applied to the iterative learning control of batch process. Using the repetitive nature of the batch process, based on the model, iterative learning control can determine the optimal operating trajectory. To overcome influences of the modeling error and the disturbances, batchwise error feedback was incorporated into the computation of the optimal operating policy to guarantee the convergence of the iteration process. Simulation example demonstrated that the method can improve the process performance gradually as a batch process repeated, which made the product quality index converge to the desired value even model mismatches and disturbances exist.","","978-1-4577-0816-9","10.1109/ICICIP.2011.6008391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6008391","","Support vector machines;Batch production systems;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Optimal control;Inductors;Data models","adaptive control;batch processing (industrial);iterative methods;learning systems;process control;quality management;regression analysis;support vector machines","iterative learning control;batch process control;support vector regression model;batchwise error feedback;support vector machine;data-driven modeling problem;modeling error;product quality index","","3","","16","","1 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several features found in neural networks make them desirable for music composition. These features include the ability to learn complex relationships from examples and to make reasonable generalizations in situations for which they have not been trained. Training consists of exposing the network to examples of music and adjusting its internal representation to match the input examples. It is this internalization of the music which represents many aspects and relationships that humans perceive both consciously and unconsciously. The method used to present the music to the network will therefore largely affect what features the network will extract. Several strategies involved in creating music using neural networks have been examined, and work involving multiple input training which mimics the functions of the right and left hemispheres of the brain has been carried out.<>","","0-7803-0164-1","10.1109/IJCNN.1991.155567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=155567","","Multiple signal classification;Biological neural networks;Brain modeling;Simulated annealing;Convergence;Cooling;Processor scheduling;Computer networks;Information science;Impedance matching","brain models;learning systems;music;neural nets","learning from examples;human perception;music composition;neural networks;complex relationships;generalizations;internal representation;multiple input training;brain","","","1","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The various approaches do not guarantee the desired performance in practical applications when there exist some modeling errors between the model and the actual system. In this paper, iterative learning control scheme is applied to RTP without exact information on the dynamics. The learning gain of the iterative learning law is estimated by neural networks instead of a mathematical model. In addition, the control information obtained by the iterative learning controller (ILC) is accumulated in the feedforward neuro controller (FNC) for generalization to various reference profiles. Through numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve an accurate output tracking even without an exact RTP model. The output errors decrease rapidly through iterations when using the learning gain estimated and the FNC yields a reduced initial error, and so requires small iterations.","1558-2345","","10.1109/66.909649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=909649","","Temperature control;Rapid thermal processing;Mathematical model;Semiconductor process modeling;Neural networks;Error correction;Control systems;Adaptive control;Numerical simulation;Yield estimation","rapid thermal processing;temperature control;adaptive control;iterative methods;neurocontrollers;tracking;feedforward;process control","learning approach;wafer temperature control;rapid thermal processing system;system dynamics;modeling errors;iterative learning control scheme;iterative learning law;neural networks;iterative learning controller;feedforward neuro controller;reference profiles;output tracking;RTP model;output errors;learning gain","","26","2","17","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, in this paper, we study unsupervised learning to estimate the values of the parameters that characterize statistical properties for wireless sensor networks employing a bandwidth efficient multiple access scheme, e.g., the type-based multiple access (TBMA), over Rayleigh fading channels (which would be realistic channels when there is no line-of-sight between sensors and fusion center).

Suggested VLC modules should not only improve communication quality such as decreasing error rates but also comply with other lighting related constraints such as sustaining certain level of illumination. This increases the complexity of the optimization problem. Moreover, most of the time the suggested modules focus on a specific block of communication system which downgrades the system-wide performance on coming together. To solve this complex problem and jointly optimize the whole system, we suggest a deep learning based method, VLCnet. Despite the increasing number of neural network based channel decoders in the literature, few of them are addressing real-life application constraints. VLCnet is an error rate decreasing solution which takes into account, reducing flicker and sustaining certain illumination level. Moreover, our channel impulse response (CIR) is taken from reference CIRs for VLC and our study considers the input-dependent noise originated by the shot noise for the sake of generality. Flicker reducing activation units (FRAU) are the key part of VLCnet and the main novelty of this publication. FRAU is an example of a competitive layer and ensures run length limitation for flicker reduction. Both with input-independent and dependent noise, simulation results show performance superiority of the proposed VLCnet method. Although they have different setups, all results demonstrate the benefit of training with certain amount of noise. From the practicality perspective, proposed system is easy to be deployed since inference operation does not have iterations unlike most of the conventional detectors.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.3006827","TÜBA Gebip program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133271","Visible light communications;autoencoder;competitive learning;flicker reduction;input dependent noise","Visible light communication;Deep learning;Lighting;Neural networks;Decoding;Training","decoding;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optical communication;optimisation;telecommunication computing;transient response","end-to-end visible light communication system;research area;lighting related requirements;communication quality;lighting related constraints;optimization problem;system-wide performance;complex problem;deep learning based method;real-life application constraints;error rate decreasing solution;illumination level;channel impulse response;input-dependent noise;VLCnet method;flicker reducing activation units","","","","31","IEEE","3 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, it presents a framework of mechanisms blind students apply to identify basic 3D objects into free space. People with visual impairments are still excluded from accessing certain types of information - like graphics - that are easily accessible by the general public. Today, screen reading software and Braille displays or text-to-speech systems have solved many problems of accessing text. For accessing graphics, and specifically digital graphics, there is to date no standardised technology that is accepted and used by blind people. Especially in school education, access to pictures is almost impossible to master; making teamwork very complicated and thus isolating blind students from their sighted peers making it impossible to acquire a shared understanding of school material. Focusing on geometry, which is believed to be the main theory of space, is very crucial for non-sighted students to develop an accurate spatial sense and reasoning. The emergence of haptic technology and the potential to create interfaces for non-visual audio-haptic interaction opens new promising doors to accessing digital graphics.","","978-1-4577-1301-9","10.1109/CEEC.2011.5995820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995820","Haptic System;Virtual Learning Environments;Novint Falcon;Vision;Human Computer Interaction","Educational institutions;Visualization;Face;Three dimensional displays;Haptic interfaces;Fingers;Games","computer aided instruction;computer graphics;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces;shape recognition;speech synthesis","audio haptic learning environment;3D shapes learning;haptic sense technology;blind students;visual impairments;Braille displays;text-to-speech systems;digital graphics;school education;school material;haptic technology","","6","","16","","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by the observation that humans continually adapt their behavior when interacting under varying social context, we propose Adaptive EXP4 (A-EXP4), a novel online learning algorithm for adapting the robot-pedestrian interaction policy. To address limitations of bandit algorithms in adaptation to unseen and highly dynamic scenarios, we employ a mixture model over the policy parameter space. Specifically, a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPMM) is used to cluster the parameters of sampled policies and maintain a mixture model over the clusters, hence effectively discovering policies that are suitable to the current environmental context in an unsupervised manner. Our simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility of A-EXP4 in accommodating interaction with different types of pedestrians while jointly minimizing social disruption through the adaptation process. While the A-EXP4 formulation is kept general for application in a variety of domains requiring continual adaptation of a robot's policy, we specifically evaluate the performance of our algorithm using a suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform. In this concrete assistive scenario, the algorithm observes how audio signals produced by the navigational system affect the behavior of pedestrians and adapts accordingly. Consequently, we find A-EXP4 to effectively adapt the interaction policy for gently clearing a navigation path in crowded settings, resulting in significant reduction in empirical regret compared to the EXP4 baseline.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967737","","","audio signal processing;control engineering computing;Gaussian processes;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;mobile robots;pedestrians","online social policy learning;Adaptive robot-pedestrian interaction;self-supervised adaptation;social interaction;active communication;audio signals;visual signals;social context;Adaptive EXP4;online learning algorithm;robot-pedestrian interaction policy;bandit algorithms;unseen scenarios;highly dynamic scenarios;policy parameter space;Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model;sampled policies;current environmental context;social disruption;adaptation process;continual adaptation;suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform;EXP4 baseline;navigation path;crowded settings","","","","45","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve forecasting performance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employing bootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods. Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance, which provides approximated correlations between players, which we leverage to develop a novel correlated utility learning framework.

Therefore, it is meaningful and valuable to research on bouncing-times. Graph modeling is an efficient technique that can be applied to simulation of the channel characteristics. Bouncing-times is an important parameter for graph modeling of propagation characteristics with fidelity and accuracy. A proper setting of the bouncing-times can largely reduce the computational cost of graph modeling with no tradeoff of the performance. In this work, a novel method based on deep learning (DL) applied to prediction of bouncing-times accurately is proposed. We choose foliage scenario as sample environment and train a neural network that can predict bouncing-times directly from the power delay profile (PDP) of a propagation channel. Both experimental PDPs and measurement PDPs are used to validate the neural network being trained. The result shows that the neural network being trained can accurately predict the bouncing-times for foliage scenario.

The traditional machine learning (ML) model is usually effective in the training process, unfortunately, its generalization ability is limited for practical application. Inspired by the artificial neural network (ANN) and the Gaussian process (GP) kernel learning model, a deep kernel learning (DKL) model with multiple-nonlinear-mapping layers is proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In this work, correlation characteristics of training samples are transformed by multiple layers, and then they act as inputs of the GP model. Simultaneously, we use PSO to optimize the weights, biases of each mapping layer, and GP hyperparameters, aiming to determine and optimize the DKL model structure. As a result, the proposed DKL is suitable for processing small samples, as well as has the generalization ability of a deep network, which avoids the phenomenon of gradient disappearance to some extent caused by error back propagation (BP) in the deep network and improves the modeling accuracy while effectively ensuring the modeling efficiency. In this study, the performance of the DKL model is evaluated by using the resonant frequencies of two microstrip antennas (MSAs), and the predicted results of the DKL model are compared with those via different modeling methods. The results show that prediction accuracy of the DKL is 18.906% higher than that of the GP, 38.926% higher than the ANN, and 46.660% higher than the neural network ensemble (NNE).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3062940","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Higher Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366468","Gaussian process (GP);particle swarm optimization (PSO);resonance frequency","Training;Artificial neural networks;Electromagnetics;Kernel;Predictive models;Optimization;Covariance matrices","deep learning (artificial intelligence);Gaussian processes;microstrip antennas;neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;telecommunication computing","deep network;neural network ensemble;resonant frequency modeling;electromagnetic components;full-wave electromagnetic simulation software;machine learning model;artificial neural network;deep kernel learning model;multiple-nonlinear-mapping layers;particle swarm optimization algorithm;PSO;GP model;mapping layer;GP hyperparameters;DKL model structure;Gaussian process kernel learning model;ANN;correlation characteristics;gradient disappearance;error back propagation;microstrip antennas;NNE","","","","32","CCBY","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, this paper presents an adaptive supplementary damping controller (SDC) for voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) by using the goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP). Compared with conventional heuristic dynamic programming (HDP), GrHDP adds a new goal representation network to generate an adaptive reward signal to achieve better mapping relationship between the system states and the control action. To compensate phase shift between the output and input signals of a complex AC/DC power system, this paper proposes a parallel phase shift channel for the GrHDP. Moreover, the proposed GrHDP-SDC is a model-free control scheme, which does not need the mathematic model of the power system and has quick online learning ability to adapt to the variation of system operating conditions. Case studies are carried out on the 10-machine 39-bus system and 16-machine 68-bus system, respectively.

However, KD is constrained in a teacher-student manner. Thus, this method may not be appropriate in general situations, where the learning abilities of two models are uncertain or not significantly different. In this paper, we propose a collaborative learning (CL) method, which is a flexible strategy to achieve bidirectional model assistance for two models using a mutual knowledge base (MKB). The MKB is used to collect mutual information and provide assistance, and it is updated along with the learning process of the two models and separately deployed when converged. We show that CL can be applied to any two deep neural networks and is easily extended to multiple networks. Compared with the teacher-student framework, CL can achieve bidirectional assistance and does not impose specific requirements on the involved models, such as pretraining and different abilities. The experimental results demonstrate that CL can efficiently improve the learning ability and convergence speed of the two models, with superior performance to a series of relevant methods, such as ensemble learning and a series of KD-based methods.

Specifically, we put forth two MUD schemes, termed random sparsity learning multiuser detection (RSL-MUD) and structured sparsity learning multiuser detection (SSL-MUD) for the time-slotted and non-time-slotted grant-free MaDMA systems, respectively. In RSL-MUD, active users generate and transmit data packets with random sparsity. In SSL-MUD, we introduce a sliding-window-based detection framework, and the user signals in each observation window naturally exhibit structured sparsity. We show that by exploiting the sparsity embedded in the user signals, we can recover the user activity state, the channel, and the user data in a single phase, without using pilot signals for channel estimation and/or active user identification. To this end, we develop a message-passing-based statistical inference framework for the BS to blindly detect the user data without any prior knowledge of the identities and the channel state information (CSI) of active users. The simulation results show that our RSL-MUD and SSL-MUD schemes significantly outperform their counterpart schemes in both reducing the transmission overhead and improving the error behavior of the system.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2915955","General Research Funds; University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; The Key Areas of Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8716690","Massive-device multiple access;multiuser detection;sparsity learning;message passing","Multiuser detection;Channel estimation;MIMO communication;Sparse matrices;Decoding;Wireless communication;Bayes methods","channel estimation;learning (artificial intelligence);message passing;multi-access systems;multiuser channels;multiuser detection;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication computing","RSL-MUD;message-passing-based statistical inference framework;SSL-MUD schemes;sparsity learning-based multiuser detection;multiuser detection problem;grant-free massive-device multiple access system;multiantenna base station;structured sparsity learning multiuser detection;nontime-slotted grant-free MaDMA systems","","12","","40","","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this framework, neural network models constitute an important class of on-line approximators. Changes in the system dynamics are monitored by an on-line approximation model, which is used not only for detecting but also for accommodating failures.

To deal with the non-repetitiveness caused by different downstream traffic conditions at different iterations, the classical discrete-time ILC is incorporated with real-time feedback module. Boundedness of output tracking error can be guaranteed under iteration-varying downstream density conditions as the iteration tends to infinity.

This feature is considered to be critical for any true autonomy; however it also introduces a potential for tremendous risk of unknown new events. To better determine some of the undesirable consequences, a concept of nonholonomic constraints for representing dynamic changes in relationships within neural networks and super neural networks is generalized to quantum nonholonomic constraints. This is intended to develop barrier mechanisms of a psychological nature in the mutual interactions of high-autonomy systems. A target-dedicated self-development of nonholonomic constraints is introduced. It is intended to provide mechanisms for optimal self-control development.

In these circumstances, we can leverage tactile feedback between the gripper and the environment. In this paper, we present learnable Bayes filter models that can localize robotic grippers using tactile feedback. We propose a novel observation model that conditions the tactile feedback on visual maps of the environment along with a motion model to recursively estimate the gripper's location.

However, it is found that momentum may make BP convergence unstable, but that one can redesign the PID controller to avoid this problem.<>","","0-7803-0227-3","10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=170622","","Neural networks;Control theory;Three-term control;Kinematics;Writing;PD control;Pi control;Proportional control;Backpropagation;Convergence","control system analysis;controllers;kinematics;learning systems;neural nets;robots;three-term control","three term control;control system analysis;robots;control theory;neural controller architectures;general learning;special learning;PUMA 560 inverse kinematics;writing;PID;momentum factor;backpropagation","","","","","","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, the ES uses second-order eneralized integrator phase locked loop (SOGI-PLL) to track the voltage and frequency of power grid, and uses proportional-integral (PI) controller to stabilize the critical load (CL) voltage. However, for microgrids with large voltage and frequency fluctuations, the conventional ES control method is difficult to stabilize the CL voltage quickly and accurately. To solve this problem, an ES control method based on cascade second-order generalized integrator phase locked loop (CSOGI-PLL) and simplified brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) is proposed in this paper. By using the frequency adaptive tracking characteristic of CSOGI-PLL, the ability of ES to stabilize CL voltage in power grid with large frequency variation is improved. An ES control method based on simplified BELBIC is proposed, which uses its self-learning ability to automatically adjust control parameters and improve the control speed of ES. To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the ES is modeled and simulated by MATLAB/Simulink and verified by dSPACE platform.

However, due to limited energy and computation capability at the mobile devices, the performance of the model training is always at stake to meet the objective of local energy minimization. In this regard, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC)-enabled FL addresses the tradeoff between the model performance and the energy consumption of the mobile devices by allowing users to offload a portion of their local dataset to an edge server for the model training. Since the edge server has high computation capability, the time consumption of the model training at the edge server is insignificant. However, the time consumption for dataset offloading from mobile users to the edge server has a significant impact on the total time consumed to complete a single round of FL process. Thus, resource management in MEC-enabled FL is challenging, where the objective is to reduce the total time consumption while saving the energy consumption of the mobile devices. In this article, we formulate an energy-aware resource management for MEC-enabled FL in which the model training loss and the total time consumption are jointly minimized, while considering the energy limitation of mobile devices. In addition, we recast the formulated problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) to capture the coupling constraints between the radio resource management and dataset offloading. To that end, we analyze the impact of the dataset offloading and computing resource allocation on the model training loss, time, and the energy consumption. Finally, we present the convergence analysis of the proposed solution, and evaluate its performance against the traditional FL approach.

Although the difficulty can be effectively overcome by the RL strategy, the existing RL algorithms are very complex because their updating laws are obtained by carrying out gradient descent algorithm to square of the approximated HJB equation (Bellman residual error). For a multiagent system, due to the state coupling problem, these methods will become difficult implementation. In the proposed optimized scheme, the RL updating laws are derived from negative gradient of a simple positive function, which is the equivalence to HJB equation; therefore, the control algorithm is significantly simple.

This software tool offers the needed functionality to work with general purpose inductive learning. Now, new functionalities, those needed to cope with hybrid fuzzy modeling, are being added to it. In order to reach our main goal, the following four ones are the most important ideas that we will consider. The first one is that we see data driven fuzzy modeling as a set of successive transformations done to data, starting from the raw source data and finishing at the desired fuzzy inference system. The second one is the modelization of the ""fuzzy modeling task"" concept in terms of domains, codomains, preconditions, postconditions inside a concrete domain of discourse. The third one is the definition of different schemes for tasks composition to form higher level tasks in a transparent manner. Finally, the fourth one is the concretion of the methodological steps to follow on the integration into this new framework of base techniques to be used as building blocks to compound higher level tasks. All these ideas are finally illustrated with an example.","","0-7803-7810-5","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1206570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206570","","Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;System identification;Computer architecture;Software systems;Software tools;Finishing;Concrete;Input variables;Machine learning","deterministic automata;hybrid simulation;learning systems;fuzzy set theory;learning by example","hybrid fuzzy modeling framework;software system;inductive learning;data driven fuzzy modeling;raw source data;fuzzy inference system;fuzzy modeling task;discourse concrete domain;hybridization;compound higher level tasks;METALA;META learning architecture;deterministic finite automata","","","","15","","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this method is a very simple technique but it creates significant errors in localization estimations due to nonlinear relationship between RSSI and distance. The generalized regression neural network (GRNN) being a one-pass learning algorithm is well known for its ability to train quickly on sparse data sets. This paper proposes an implementation of GRNN as an alternative to this traditional RSSI-based approach, to obtain first location estimates of single target moving in 2-D in WSN, which are then further refined using Kalman filtering (KF) framework. Two algorithms namely, GRNN + KF and GRNN + unscented KF (UKF) are proposed in this paper. The GRNN is trained with the simulated RSSI values received at moving target from beacon nodes and the corresponding actual target 2-D locations. The precision of the proposed algorithms are compared against traditional RSSI-based, GRNN-based approach as well as other models in the literature such as traditional RSSI + KF and traditional RSSI + UKF algorithms. The proposed algorithms demonstrate superior tracking performance (tracking accuracy in the scale of few centimeters) irrespective of nonlinear system dynamics as well as environmental dynamicity.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2018.2873357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8478766","General regression neural network (GRNN);Kalman filter (KF);received signal strength indicators (RSSIs);target tracking;unscented Kalman FILTER (UKF);wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Target tracking;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Noise measurement;Neural networks;Heuristic algorithms;Kalman filters","Kalman filters;neural nets;regression analysis;sensor placement;target tracking;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","simulated RSSI values;GRNN-based approach;Kalman filtering framework-based real time target tracking;wireless sensor networks;generalized regression neural network;lateration/angulation techniques;localization estimations;one-pass learning algorithm;traditional RSSI-based approach;location estimates;unscented KF;received signal strength indicators-based moving target localization;UKF algorithms;target 2-D locations","","11","","31","","2 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, control strategy is learned online via Q-learning algorithm, and CMAC network is used to generalize the value function of action. Finally, typical control tasks are carried out using a simulated low altitude airship. Control strategy could be worked out without access to airship accurate dynamic model. Results show that the airship's MDP model parameters using the adaptive method are better matched with each other than using simple equally divided method, and CMAC networks could accelerate converge of algorithm.

The behavior of a single decision-maker containing a neural network is studied in a random environment using reinforcement learning. The objective is to determine the optimal action corresponding to a particular state. Since decisions have to be made throughout the context space based on a countable number of experiments, generalization is inevitable. Many different approaches can be followed to generate the desired discriminant function. Three different methods which use neural networks are discussed and compared. In the most general method, the output of the network determines the probability with which one of the actions is to be chosen. The weights of the network are updated on the basis of the actions and the response of the environment. The extension of similar concepts to decentralized decision-making in a context space is also introduced. Simulation results are included. Modifications in the implementations of the most general method to make it practically viable are also presented. All the methods suggested are feasible and the choice of a specific method depends on the accuracy desired as well as on the available computational power.<>","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.80288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=80288","","Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Learning automata;Stochastic processes;Decision making;Context modeling","automata theory;content-addressable storage;learning systems;neural nets","random environments;neural networks;learning automata;reinforcement learning;discriminant function;decentralized decision-making;context space","","17","","15","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is usually hard to predict the attacked targets, which makes it difficult to design a proactive defensive strategy. This study tackles the issue of connected vehicles under bounded data injection attacks. We propose an active attack-defense model based on game theory and solve the model using a reinforcement learning-based method. The vehicle-attacker system is modeled as a game-theoretic framework based on the generalized weakened fictitious play, in which each player uses the best actions to react to the opponents' empirical actions. A novel mixed adversarial reinforcement learning is employed to learn the attack-defense model which makes the model self-evolutionary. Moreover, our model is validated in a car-following scenario through numerical simulations and comparative studies under different forms of attacks. Results show that our model can recognize the attacked sensors and the defensive effectiveness of connected vehicles increases by nearly 30% under bounded attacks.","","978-1-7281-2485-8","10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9002791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9002791","connected vehicles;attack and defense;game theory;generalized weakened fictitious play;adversarial reinforcement learning.","Handheld computers;Computational intelligence;Game theory;Learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes","game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense strategy;malicious attacks;vehicle communication facilities;traffic accidents;proactive defensive strategy;bounded data injection attacks;active attack-defense model;reinforcement learning-based method;vehicle-attacker system;game-theoretic framework;attacked sensors;defensive effectiveness;mixed adversarial reinforcement learning;connected vehicles perception","","","","30","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MPILC exploits two key factors: frequent glucose readings made possible by continuous glucose monitoring technology; and the repetitive nature of glucose-meal-insulin dynamics with a 24-h cycle. The proposed algorithm can learn from an individual's lifestyle, allowing the control performance to be improved from day to day. After less than 10 days, the blood glucose concentrations can be kept within a range of 90-170 mg/dL. Generally, control performance under MPILC is better than that under MPC. The proposed methodology is robust to random variations in meal timings within ±60 min or meal amounts within ±75% of the nominal value, which validates MPILC's superior robustness compared to run-to-run control. Moreover, to further improve the algorithm's robustness, an automatic scheme for setpoint update that ensures safe convergence is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require user intervention; hence, the algorithm should be of particular interest for glycemic control in children and adolescents.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2024409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5072274","Glycemic control;iterative learning control;model predictive control;run-to-run control;type 1 diabetes mellitus","Pancreas;Sugar;Automatic control;Predictive models;Robust control;Predictive control;Diabetes;Monitoring;Iterative algorithms;Blood","cellular biophysics;chemical variables control;closed loop systems;diseases;iterative methods;learning systems;medical control systems;predictive control;sugar","closed-loop control;artificial pancreatic ß -cell;type 1 diabetes mellitus;model predictive iterative learning control;glycemic control;blood glucose concentrations;meal timings;meal amounts;glucose-meal-insulin dynamics;continuous glucose monitoring;frequent glucose readings;time 24 h","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Blood Glucose;Computer Simulation;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Humans;Insulin;Insulin;Insulin Infusion Systems;Models, Biological;Systems Biology","112","10","23","","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system in its current configuration is designed to enable distance training of students in real scenarios of robot manipulator programming. From a technological perspective, the research work presented in this paper is directed towards the adaptation of concepts and techniques developed in the field of telerobotics and virtual reality, and their integration in such e-laboratory settings. This paper focuses particularly on the educational impact of such systems. The goal is to assess the performance of e-laboratory scenarios in terms of the efficacy of training provided to students. The results of a pilot experimental study are presented, providing a comparative evaluation for three training modalities: real, remote, and virtual training on robot manipulator programming. The experiments were conducted according to an evaluation protocol specially designed for the considered target training task, using scoring charts to obtain quantitative performance measures and assess the performance of the student groups participating in the course. Training, as a dynamic process, is approached according to a classical three dimensional model, and performance scores are accordingly assessed in these dimensions (namely: low-level versus mid and high-level skills and understanding). The obtained results reveal certain differences between the three groups, particularly as related to the low-level skill training score, giving some insight about the training `dimensions' that are expected to be mostly affected by the absence of physical (or realistic virtual) presence in a real hands-on experimentation. Statistical analysis indicates, however, that, despite these apparent differences, such e-laboratory modules can be integrated quite effectively in practical scenarios, creating virtual training environments that can provide adequate learning elements, as related particularly to mid and high-level skill acquisition. Further work and large-scale studies are still needed, though, in order to explore the extent to which such a general conclusion is valid in different training settings, and to form the basis of a more theoretical evaluation for a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical differences between real, virtual, and remote learning/training methodologies and experiences","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2006.879255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668280","Distance training;evaluation methodology;remote laboratory;telerobotics;virtual robotic laboratory","Manipulators;Telerobotics;Virtual reality;Control engineering education;Statistics;Student experiments","computer based training;control engineering education;distance learning;educational courses;manipulators;statistical analysis;student experiments;telerobotics;virtual reality","virtual robotic laboratory;remote robotic laboratory;e-laboratory;distance training;robot manipulator programming;telerobotics;virtual reality;scoring charts;statistical analysis;virtual training environments;high-level skill acquisition","","103","","24","","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

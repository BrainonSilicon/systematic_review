In numerical simulations with a triangulated boundary-element three-concentric-spheres head model, we compare four inverse electroencephalogram (EEG) solutions: those obtained utilizing conventional or reciprocal forward transfer matrices, relating in each case source dipole components to potentials at either triangle centroids or triangle vertices. Single-dipole inverse solutions were obtained using simplex optimization with an additional position constraint limiting solution dipoles to within the brain region. Dipole localization errors are presented in all four cases, for varying dipole eccentricity and two different values of skull conductivity. Both conventional and reciprocal forward transfer matrices yielded inverse dipole solutions of comparable accuracy. Localization errors were low even for highly eccentric source dipoles on account of the nonlinear nature of the single-dipole solution and the position constraint. In the presence of Gaussian noise, both conventional and reciprocal approaches were also found to be equally robust to skull conductivity errors.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.812198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203804","","Electroencephalography;Skull;Conductivity;Inverse problems;Electrodes;Conductors;Brain modeling;Scalp;Biomedical engineering;Robustness","electroencephalography;inverse problems;transfer function matrices;boundary-elements methods;medical signal processing;Gaussian noise;minimisation","electroencephalography;inverse dipole localization problem;reciprocal approach;conventional approach;forward transfer matrices;dipole source;surface potentials;numerical simulations;triangulated boundary-element three-concentric-spheres head model;inverse electroencephalogram solutions;EEG;source dipole components;triangle centroids;triangle vertices;single-dipole inverse solutions;simplex optimization;position constraint;solution dipoles;brain region;dipole eccentricity;skull conductivity;localization errors;highly eccentric source dipoles;single-dipole solution;Gaussian noise;skull conductivity errors","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electric Conductivity;Electroencephalography;Electromagnetic Fields;Head;Humans;Models, Neurological;Neurons;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Skull","15","","19","","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the efficacy of these approaches is limited if they do not explicitly account for stochasticity in the target environment. In this work, we analyze the problems associated with grounding a deterministic simulator in a stochastic real world environment, and we present examples where GAT fails to transfer a good policy due to stochastic transitions in the target domain. In response, we introduce the Stochastic Grounded Action Transformation (SGAT) algorithm, which models this stochasticity when grounding the simulator.

The final objective is to present timely information about transfer limits and stability margins and eventually implement corrective actions. In this paper, the authors assume that the dynamic contingency analysis (DCA) has to be repeated every 15 minutes. During this period of time, the loading and configuration conditions of the system change significantly but not drastically. They verify that the set of the relevant contingencies remains almost the same in the time interval comprised between two cycles of the functions associated to dynamic security analysis (DSA). Parallel-in-time formulated algorithms can be used in tracking the load conditions in real-time adopting as initial guess for the simulation of each contingency, the trajectories obtained for the same contingency at the previous cycle of DSA functions (that is the ones calculated in the previous 15 minutes). In this way, the information obtained in a previous cycle of DCA is not lost completely as in step-by-step algorithms.

This production line is a multistage transfer machine that converts black wire reel stock into ground and polished steel rods of standard length using multistage processing. In order to characterize subsystem failure and repair mechanisms, the entire multistage machine is subdivided into seven major independent subsystems. Three classes of maintenance policies, opportunistic, failure, and block, were simulated and compared in order to determine the best maintenance policy. The objective criterion applied to evaluate policies was availability percent. It was determined that the opportunistic maintenance policy was far superior to existing maintenance policies. Existing maintenance policies were a haphazard combination of failure maintenance and block maintenance actions. Using past data on types of maintenance activities performed, a compilation of detailed preventive maintenance procedures was developed in the form of a checklist.<>","","0-7803-0521-3","10.1109/ARMS.1992.187808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=187808","","Production;Steel;Wire;Milling machines;Preventive maintenance;Iron alloys;Bars;Electric breakdown;Statistics;Weibull distribution","failure analysis;maintenance engineering;reliability;rolling mills;steel industry","reliability;failure analysis;simulation model;maintenance planning;automated production line;steel rolling mill;multistage transfer machine;subsystem failure;repair;availability;opportunistic maintenance;failure maintenance;block maintenance","","3","","3","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as exponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes it difficult to scale up to realistic multiagent problems. In this paper, a novel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSIs) is presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction-based MARL algorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for agents to select the nonstrict equilibrium-dominating strategy profile (nonstrict EDSP) or meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented NegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: 1) the equilibrium-based framework for sparse interactions; 2) the negotiation for the equilibrium set; 3) the minimum variance method for selecting one joint action; and 4) the knowledge transfer of local ${Q}$ -values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared value functions, equilibrium solutions, and sparse interactions are adopted to achieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational complexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI algorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria: 1) steps of each episode; 2) rewards of each episode; and 3) average runtime. The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games and shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm. Then in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent warehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2543238","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7445162","Knowledge transfer;multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL);negotiation;sparse interactions","Games;Heuristic algorithms;Markov processes;Robot kinematics;Knowledge transfer;Modeling","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","multiagent reinforcement learning;sparse interactions;knowledge transfer;multiagent systems;unknown dynamic environments;exponential computation complexity;joint state-action space;realistic multiagent problems;negotiation-based MARL algorithms;sparse-interaction-based MARL algorithms;nonstrict equilibrium-dominating strategy profile;nonstrict EDSP;meta equilibrium;NegoSI algorithm;equilibrium-based framework;equilibrium set;minimum variance method;unshared value functions;equilibrium solutions;privacy protection;computational complexity;grid world games;intelligent warehouse problem","","23","","48","","31 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A unipolar injection from the inner cylinder introduces free space charges into the liquid. Numerical results are presented for the configuration of inner to outer diameter ratio of 0.5 and silicon oil as the working medium. It is found that the charge injection may induce a strong radial fluid motion, which consequently augments the heat transfer rate. Due to the linear stability nature of electro-convection, there exists a threshold value of the electric driving parameter, above which the electrical enhancement becomes manifest. In addition, when the electric driving parameter is sufficiently high, the flow is fully dominated by the Coulomb force, and thus heat transfer becomes independent of the thermal driving parameter.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2015.005343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480619","Electrohydrodynamics;dielectric liquid;charge injection;heat transfer enhancement;numerical analysis;annular geometry","Liquids;Mathematical model;Force;Convection;Electric fields","dielectric liquids;electrohydrodynamics;natural convection;numerical analysis","numerical evaluation;heat transfer enhancement;annular electroconvection;dielectric liquid;natural convection heat transfer;Coulomb force;thermal gradient","","1","","41","","30 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our model achieves 84% grasp success on 172 real world objects while being trained only in simulation on 48 objects with just naive domain randomization. Similar to computer vision problems, such as object detection, Action Image builds on the idea that object features are invariant to translation in image space. Therefore, grasp quality is invariant when evaluating the object-gripper relationship; a successful grasp for an object depends on its local context, but is independent of the surrounding environment. Action Image represents a grasp proposal as an image and uses a deep convolutional network to infer grasp quality. We show that by using an Action Image representation, trained networks are able to extract local, salient features of grasping tasks that generalize across different objects and environments. We show that this representation works on a variety of inputs, including color images (RGB), depth images (D), and combined color-depth (RGB-D). Our experimental results demonstrate that networks utilizing an Action Image representation exhibit strong domain transfer between training on simulated data and inference on real-world sensor streams. Finally, our experiments show that a network trained with Action Image improves grasp success (84% vs. 53%) over a baseline model with the same structure, but using actions encoded as vectors.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197415","","Grasping;Robot sensing systems;Image representation;Proposals;Grippers;Task analysis","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;grippers;image colour analysis;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);robot vision;vectors","Action image representation;zero real world data;end-to-end deep-grasping policy;grasp quality;object-gripper relationship;deep convolutional network;Action Image representation;color images;depth images;combined color-depth;scalable deep grasping policy learning;salient feature extraction","","","","27","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate a simulated reaching task by training controllers under prenatal conditions (i.e. confined space) and evaluating them based on postnatal conditions (i.e. targets outside of the confined training space). One possible solution is to identify a sensory representation that is easy to extrapolate over. We compared two kinds of sensory representations: world-centered sensory representation based on Cartesian coordinates and agent-centered sensory representation based on polar coordinates. Despite similar performance under prenatal conditions, controllers using agent-centered sensory representation had significantly better performance than controllers using world-centered sensory representation under postnatal conditions. It turns out that the success of the agent-centered sensory representation is (in part) due to being complementary to the action encodings. Further analysis shows that the action encodings (i.e. changes in joint angles) were highly predictive of the change in state when agent-centered sensory representation was used (but not world-centered). This suggests that a powerful strategy for transferring sensory-motor skills to postnatal life involves selecting a sensory representation that complements the action encodings used by an agent.","2161-9476","978-1-4244-6902-4","10.1109/DEVLRN.2010.5578844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578844","","Joints;Optical wavelength conversion;Training;Elbow;Shoulder;Encoding;Fetus","biomechanics;cognition;medical computing;obstetrics;paediatrics","prenatal transfer;postnatal transfer;motor skills;motor-compatible sensory representations;sensory-motor skills;fetus;reaching task;extrapolation;Cartesian coordinates;agent-centered sensory representation;action encodings","","4","","18","","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, idealized subvolumes are often used to study small-scale effects including the dynamics of magnetized turbulence. A significant aspect of magnetized turbulence is the transfer of energy from large to small scales, in part through the operation of a turbulent cascade. In this paper, we present a new shell-to-shell energy transfer analysis framework for understanding energy transfer within magnetized turbulence and in particular, through the cascade. We demonstrate the viability of this framework through application to a series of isothermal subsonic and supersonic simulations of compressible magnetized turbulence and utilize results from this analysis to establish a nonlinear benchmark for compressible magnetized turbulence in the subsonic regime. We further study how the autocorrelation time of the driving and its normalization systematically change properties of compressible magnetized turbulence. For example, we find that δ-in-time forcing with a constant energy injection leads to a steeper slope in kinetic energy spectrum and less efficient small-scale dynamo action. We examine how these results can impact a range of diagnostics relevant for a range of terrestrial and astrophysical applications.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2019.2891934","Astrophysics Science Division; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Division of Astronomical Sciences; Sandia National Laboratories; NASA Pleiades supercomputer through allocation SMD-16-7720, on the HLRN-III complex of the North-German Supercomputing; Alliance, and on the Comet Supercomputer as part of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment; National Science Foundation; SAND2019-0075 J; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8641441","Astrophysics;plasma devices;plasma simulation","Plasmas;Mathematical model;Magnetohydrodynamics;Computational modeling;Laboratories;Ions","astrophysical fluid dynamics;flow simulation;magnetohydrodynamics;numerical analysis;supersonic flow;turbulence","turbulent cascade;energy transfer;compressible magnetized turbulence;kinetic energy spectrum;small-scale dynamo action;isothermal supersonic simulations;isothermal subsonic simulations;astrophysical applications","","","","22","","13 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These filters are based on the 2-D spatial wavelet decomposition of the surface EMG recorded with a grid of electrodes and inverse transformation after zeroing a subset of the transformation coefficients. The filter transfer function depends on the selected mother wavelet in the two spatial directions. Wavelet parameterization is proposed with the aim of signal-based optimization of the transfer function of the spatial filter. The optimization criterion was the minimization of the entropy of the time samples of the output signal. The optimized spatial filter is linear and space invariant. In simulated and experimental recordings, the optimized wavelet filter showed increased selectivity with respect to previously proposed filters. For example, in simulation, the ratio between the peak-to-peak amplitude of action potentials generated by motor units 20deg apart in the transversal direction was 8.58% (with monopolar recording), 2.47% (double differential), 2.59% (normal double differential), and 0.47% (optimized wavelet filter). In experimental recordings, the duration of the detected action potentials decreased from (mean plusmn SD) 6.9 plusmn 0.3 ms (monopolar recording), to 4.5 plusmn 0.2 ms (normal double differential), 3.7 plusmn 0.2 ms (double differential), and 3.0 plusmn 0.1 ms (optimized wavelet filter). In conclusion, the new class of spatial filters with the proposed signal-based optimization of the transfer function allows better discrimination of individual motor unit activities in surface EMG recordings than it was previously possible.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.906509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4360131","Motor unit;selectivity;spatial filtering;surface electromyography (EMG);wavelet design;spatial filtering;wavelet design;motor unit;selectivity;surface EMG","Spatial filters;Electromyography;Finite impulse response filter;Filtering;Surface waves;Transfer functions;Transversal filters;Muscles;Interference;Sampling methods","electromyography;entropy;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;optimisation;spatial filters;wavelet transforms","entropy-based optimization;wavelet spatial filters;surface electromyographic signal detection;EMG;2-D spatial wavelet decomposition;electrodes;inverse transformation;transformation coefficients;filter transfer function;wavelet parameterization;minimization;action potentials;signal-based optimization;individual motor unit activities","Action Potentials;Adult;Algorithms;Electromyography;Entropy;Female;Humans;Male;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","6","","26","","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The patients are able to control the external devices directly from their neural signals by the decoder. Due to various reasons such as mental fatigue and distraction, the distribution of the neural signals might change, which might lead to poor performance for the decoder. In this case, we need to calibrate the parameters before each session, which needs the professionals to label the data and is not convenient for the patient's usage at home. In this paper, we propose a covariant cluster transfer mechanism for the kernel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to speed up the adaptation across sessions. The parameters of the decoder will adaptively change according to a reward signal, which could be easily set by the patient. More importantly, we cluster the neural patterns in previous sessions. The cluster represents the conditional distribution from neural patterns to actions. When a distinct neural pattern appears in the new session, the nearest cluster will be transferred. In this way, the knowledge from the old session could be utilized to accelerate the learning in the new session. Our proposed algorithm is tested on the simulated neural data where the neural signal's distribution differs across sessions. Compared with the training from random initialization and a weight transfer policy, our proposed cluster transfer mechanism maintains a significantly higher success rate and a faster adaptation when the conditional distribution from neural signals to actions remains similar.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175985","","Decoding;Kernel;Clustering algorithms;Phantoms;Training;Neural activity;Task analysis","brain;brain-computer interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;pattern clustering","brain-machine interface;motor functions;neural signals;covariant cluster transfer mechanism;kernel reinforcement learning algorithm;reward signal;neural patterns;conditional distribution;distinct neural pattern;simulated neural data;neural signal;weight transfer policy","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Humans;Learning;Reinforcement, Psychology;Reward","","","15","","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a bumpless transfer scheme for the inter-region controller switching for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines, which aims to reduce the associated power fluctuation and fatigue load. The study follows a typical partition of Region 2 (maximum power capture control), Region 2.5 (rotor speed regulation), and Region 3 (constant power control) around the rated wind speed. Two relatively simple bumpless transfer techniques, i.e., 1)the conditioning technique and 2)the linear quadratic (LQ) technique, respectively, are employed for different situations of inter-region controller switching. The conditioning bumpless transfer approach is adopted for switching between Regions 2 and 2.5 via generator torque control. The LQ bumpless transfer technical is applied to the switching between Regions 2.5 and 3, when the generator torque is saturated at its rated value, the pitch controller takes over so as to limit the load of wind turbine. The simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of inter-region switching, with significant reduction of power flicker and structural load.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2015.2471104","WE Energies Renewable Energy Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247763","Bumpless transfer;controller switch;load reduction;power quality;wind energy;Bumpless transfer;controller switch;load reduction;power quality;wind energy","Switches;Wind turbines;Closed loop systems;Rotors;Torque;Generators","linear quadratic control;load regulation;power control;rotors;torque control;wind turbines","bumpless transfer-based interregion controller switching;wind variations;rated wind speed;variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines;maximum power capture control;rotor speed regulation;constant power control;conditioning technique;linear quadratic technique;generator torque control","","7","","35","","9 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PI parameters have been adjusted so that their influence on the damping was transparent. It is well known that the derivative action is effective in obtaining the desired damping. In this paper, of particular interest to us is how to tune PID controller to suppress overshoot. In tuning controllers it is often convenient to specify a damping coefficient of the closed system. For PID control, the integral time Td and the derivative time Td are kept fixed to degenerate the order of the closed-loop transfer function. This can be easily led to pole-zero cancellation. Thus, the only one parameter of PID controller to be adjusted now becomes the proportional gain kp. It can be concluded that the PID controller provides a much better response than the PI controller presented last year. The resultant graphical comparisons document how to give a guide line for tuning of PID controller.","","978-4-907764-27-2","10.1109/SICE.2007.4421092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4421092","PID control;first-order lag plus deadtime system;Padé approximation;poles-zeros cancellation","Three-term control;Damping;Tuning;Control systems;Proportional control;Transfer functions;PD control;Pi control;Production systems;Systems engineering and theory","closed loop systems;poles and zeros;three-term control;transfer functions","tuning method;PID controller;first-order lag plus deadtime system;desired damping coefficient;tuning controllers;closed-loop transfer function;pole-zero cancellation;PI controller","","3","","4","","7 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is assumed that the vehicle is under the action of a free surface wave. The transfer function which relates the input force produced by the dorsal fins and the output variable (depth) is nonminimum phase. Since inverse controllers cannot control nonminimum phase systems, a modified controlled output variable is derived for the design of control systems. Then an inverse control law is derived for reference depth trajectory tracking. Although, the inverse controller accomplishes good depth trajectory control, oscillations in responses are observed in the presence of sinusoidal waves. Based on the internal model principle, a servo-compensator is designed for attenuating these oscillations. Simulation results are presented to show that in the closed-loop system, including the inverse controller and the servo-compensator, good depth control and regulation of pitch angle are accomplished in spite of the presence of surface waves and uncertainty in the system parameters.","0743-1619","0-7803-5519-9","10.1109/ACC.2000.878947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878947","","Vehicles;Surface waves;Control systems;Sea surface;Sliding mode control;Surface treatment;Biological control systems;Transfer functions;Trajectory;Nonlinear control systems","underwater vehicles;inverse problems;transfer functions;control system synthesis;oscillations;model reference adaptive control systems;servomechanisms;compensation;closed loop systems","dorsal fin control;nonminimum phase undersea vehicle;inverse control;biologically-inspired dorsal fins;free surface wave;nonminimum-phase transfer function;input force;modified controlled output variable;control system design;reference depth trajectory tracking;oscillations;sinusoidal waves;internal model principle;servo-compensator;closed-loop system;depth control;pitch angle regulation;system parameter uncertainty","","","","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An intelligent agent eventually learns policies from continuous sensory inputs and encodes these environmental inputs onto a discrete state space. The application of Q-learning in a continuous state/action domain is the subject of many studies. This paper uses a tree structure to approximate a Q-function using in a continuous state domain. The agent selects a discretized action with a maximum Q-value and this discretized action is then extended to a continuous action using an action bias function. Reinforcement learning is difficult for a single agent when the state space is huge. This proposed architecture is also applied to a multiagent system, wherein an individual agent transfers its useful Q-values to other agents to accelerate the learning process. Policy is shared between agents by grafting the branches of trees in which Q-values are stored to other trees. The results for simulation show that the proposed architecture performs better than tabular Q-learning and significantly accelerates the learning process because all agents use the sharing mechanisms to cooperate with each other.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2019.2926477","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755270","Multiagent system;policy sharing;Q-learning;tree structure","Aerospace electronics;Task analysis;Estimation error;Reinforcement learning;Multi-agent systems;Electrical engineering;Medical services","approximation theory;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","intelligent agent;action values;finite discrete state;generic approach;aggregation trees;policy sharing;tabular Q-learning;learning process;useful Q-values;individual agent;reinforcement learning;action bias function;continuous action;maximum Q-value;discretized action;continuous state domain;Q-function;tree structure;discrete state space;environmental inputs;continuous sensory inputs","","","","32","IEEE","3 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we describe the results of a study to investigate the effects of plumes of suspended particulate matter on the performance of high frequency sonars. Such plumes may emanate from estuaries or rivers discharging high sediment loads to coastal waters, or as a result of wave and tidal current action in stirring up bottom sediments.

It overcomes the restrictions of known concepts, in that its linear input-output transfer characteristic is not influenced by the MOS threshold voltage dependence on the source-substrate voltage or other effects. As the internal signal paths are very short, high action speed is obtained. The circuit can be implemented with a double or a single-ended output stage. Due to symmetrical internal signal paths, best results in terms of linearity, PSRR, and CMRR, are obtained in combination with a double-ended output stage. The proposed principle has been successfully incorporated in applications such as filters, and (dB-linear voltage controlled) amplifiers. To give an impression of the obtainable performance with the proposed principle, some significant simulated and measured characteristics of the manufactured test circuits are discussed.","","0-7803-5008-1","10.1109/ICECS.1998.814817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=814817","","Transconductance;Operational amplifiers;Linearity;Threshold voltage;MOSFETs;Equations;Transfer functions;Circuit testing;Nonlinear filters;Voltage control","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;operational amplifiers;continuous time filters;differential amplifiers;transfer functions","highly linear OTA;operational transconductance amplifier;large signal operations;linear input-output characteristics;analogue continuous-time circuits;CMOS OTA circuit;linear input-output transfer characteristic;MOS threshold voltage dependence;source-substrate voltage;double-ended output stage;single-ended output stage;symmetrical internal signal paths;dB-linear voltage controlled amplifiers;active filter application","","1","","6","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such modulations are important in understanding radar images of sea waves with water wavelengths longer than the radar range resolution. Existing models for the HMTF utilized in remote sensing are based on approximations derived from consideration of conservation of wave action. However, the accuracy of these approximations has been quantified only through comparison with experimental data; in such comparisons, numerous empirical models for terms such as wind forcing and breaking wave dissipation are required, which make direct evaluation of the hydrodynamic effects difficult. A method for providing direct insight into the hydrodynamic modulation of short sea waves by longer waves is described in this paper, through use of numerical nonlinear hydrodynamic codes for sea surface evolution. The codes applied are reviewed, and a Monte Carlo simulation process based on a stochastic spectrum of short waves propagating over a single deterministic long wave is described, including the data analysis techniques developed to extract a numerical HMTF from the simulated surfaces. HMTF values obtained from the simulations are compared with those from a first-order wave action solution and are found to be in reasonable agreement, although differences on the order of 10% are observed.

By imagining possible action consequences, a robot can choose specific action parameters to achieve desired goal states. We present an approach for parametrizing pushing actions based on learning internal prediction models. These pushing actions must fulfill constraints given by a high-level planner, e. g., after the push the brown box must be to the right of the orange box. In this work, we represent the perceived scenes as object-centric graphs and learn an internal model, which predicts object pose changes due to pushing actions. We train this internal model on a large synthetic data set, which was generated in simulation, and record a smaller data set on the real robot for evaluation. For a given scene and goal state, the robot generates a set of possible pushing action candidates by sampling the parameter space and then evaluating the candidates by internal simulation, i. e., by comparing the predicted effect resulting from the internal model with the desired effect provided by the high-level planner. In the evaluation, we show that our model achieves high prediction accuracy in scenes with a varying number of objects and, in contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, is able to generalize to scenes with more objects than seen during training. In experiments on the humanoid robot ARMAR-6, we validate the transfer from simulation and show that the learned internal model can be used to manipulate scenes into desired states effectively.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197295","","Predictive models;Two dimensional displays;Robots;Data models;Physics;Three-dimensional displays;Analytical models","graph theory;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators","spatial object relations;learning internal prediction models;robot tasks;possible action consequences;action parameters;desired goal states;parametrizing pushing actions;high-level planner;object-centric graphs;synthetic data set;goal state;possible pushing action candidates;high prediction accuracy;humanoid robot ARMAR-6;learned internal model;pushing action effects","","1","","34","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads. The dyads experiment in a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) scenario to move an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment to reach predefined goal configurations. In this study, we propose a sliding-window approach for feature extraction and demonstrate the online classification methodology to identify interaction patterns. We evaluate our approach using 1) a support vector machine classifier (SVMc) and 2) a Gaussian Process classifier (GPc) for multi-class classification, and achieve over 80% accuracy with both classifiers when identifying general interaction types.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2945261","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854968","Classification;Feature Extraction;Force and Tactile Sensing;Haptics and Haptic Interfaces;Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop;Learning and Adaptive Systems;Physical Human-Human Interaction;Physical Human-Robot Interaction;Recognition","Task analysis;Collaboration;Haptic interfaces;Feature extraction;Robots;Microsoft Windows;Taxonomy","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;image classification;robot vision;support vector machines;virtual reality","interaction state;physical interactions;interaction patterns;physical human-human interaction;general interaction types;interaction behaviors;collaborative object transfer;joint object transfer;online identification;haptic data;industrial settings;object co-manipulation;haptics-enabled virtual environment;sliding-window approach;feature extraction;online classification methodology;support vector machine classifier;SVMc;Gaussian process classifier;multiclass classification;general interaction type identification;automatic classification mechanism","","","","27","IEEE","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the last few years computer networks have dominated the world, forcing the development of applications operating in a network environment. Since new technologies, such as WWW, middleware, and co-operative software, have emerged, distributed application functionality has become rather complex and the requirements from the underlying network increased considerably. Distributed applications usually consist of interacting services provided in a multi-level hierarchy. In order to effectively evaluate their performance through simulation, we introduce a multilayer object-oriented modeling scheme that facilitates the in-depth and detailed distributed application description and supports most popular architectural models, such as the client/server model and its variations. Application functionality is described using predefined operations, which can be further decomposed into simpler ones through a multilayer hierarchy resulting in elementary actions that indicate primitive network operations, such as transfer or processing. Important features of the modeling scheme are extendibility and wide applicability. The simulation environment built according to this modeling scheme is also presented along with an example indicating key features and sample results.","1080-241X","0-7695-1092-2","10.1109/SIMSYM.2001.922144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922144","","Object oriented modeling;Application software;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Analytical models;Mathematical model;Geography;Computer simulation;Informatics;Communication system traffic control","object-oriented methods;digital simulation;client-server systems;software performance evaluation","object-oriented modeling;distributed applications;computer networks;performance evaluation;simulation;architectural models;client/server model;multilayer hierarchy","","","","14","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These factors are not independent of one another, nor of the thermal process in various parts of the transformer. The oil circulating within the transformer in a laminar mode should improve the heat transfer which is effected by natural or forced convection according to the mode of cooling. During its movement the viscosity and density of the coolant vary with temperature; consequently its rate of distribution undergoes significant changes under the action of the thermal field. In industry, the methods of thermal evaluation are quite standard and often lack precision. Today numerical analysis tends increasingly to validate the results and strives to show that the temperature distribution and location of the hottest spot can be predicted with precision. This work uses the finite element method combining heat transfer and fluid dynamics to explore the phenomena of natural and/or forced convection in a transformer winding, its results are based on winding geometries already used (see IEE Proc., vol. 127, Pt. C, no.6, 1980) and predict the distributions of temperature and flow consequent on the variations in properties and in boundary conditions as a function of temperature. Problems related to discretisation of the model and to natural and/or forced convection are given together with procedures for their solution.<>","","0-7803-1443-3","10.1109/CCECE.1993.332315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=332315","","Analytical models;Temperature distribution;Heat transfer;Windings;Cooling;Oil insulation;Ducts;Thermal factors;Petroleum;Viscosity","power transformers;transformer insulation;insulating oils;temperature distribution;transformer windings;fluid dynamics;finite element analysis;convection in liquids;cooling;thermal analysis","thermal analysis;power transformer windings;fluids behaviour;simulation;heat transfer factors;cooling ducts;losses distribution;finite element method;fluid dynamics;forced convection;natural convection;losses magnitude;oil;cooling;viscosity;coolant density;thermal evaluation;temperature distribution;hot spot location","","","","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each step is composed of several actions called actors. Actor can be explained as a unit function module of a worm. By dividing a worm's propagation cycle into five steps, a worm can be expressed with several actors which belong to each step. To simulate a worm with SSFNet, simulation model must be expressed with DML code. DML is used to describe the network model for SSFNet.

A theoretical study of the two-dimensional (2-D) spatial transfer function of these recording systems is developed both in case of rings with a physical dimension and in case of line rings. Design criteria for the proposed systems are presented in relation to spatial selectivity. It is shown that, given the radii of the rings, the weights of the spatial filter can be selected in order to improve the rejection of low spatial frequencies, thus increasing spatial selectivity. The theoretical transfer functions of concentric systems are obtained and compared with those of other detection systems. Signals detected with the ring electrodes and with traditional one-dimensional and 2-D systems are compared. The concentric-ring systems show higher spatial selectivity with respect to the traditional detection systems and reduce the problem of electrode location since they are invariant to rotations. The results shown are very promising for the noninvasive detection of single motor unit (MU) activities and decomposition of the surface EMG signal into the constituent MU action potential trains.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.959328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959328","","Electrodes;Electromyography;Muscles;Spatial filters;Two dimensional displays;Transfer functions;Disk recording;Filtering;Frequency;Signal detection","electromyography;biomedical electrodes","concentric-ring electrode systems;noninvasive detection;single motor unit activity;two-dimensional spatial transfer function;recording systems;design criteria;line rings;spatial filter weight;surface EMG signal decomposition;constituent MU action potential trains","Action Potentials;Biomedical Engineering;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Electromyography;Electromyography;Electrophysiology;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Neurons;Neuromuscular Diseases","75","6","41","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, characteristics of the traditional single-wire ECPT systems are very sensitive to the transfer distance. Solving these problems, in the range of tens of meters, the proposed scheme can eliminate the decrease of the transfer efficiency and variation of the output power without any tuning, which realizes strictly stable and long-distance energy transfer. The coupled-mode model of the system is built first, and then the transfer performances are analyzed. The modal solutions and action mechanism of the system are specified. Furthermore, the parameter design method to realize target efficiency and critical distance is also presented. A circuit model is built to verify the theoretical analysis. Simulated results indicate that, within the critical distance, the proposed system can achieve energy transfer with constant efficiency of 50% and constant output power of 4.1 kW, which does not need any tuning.

Type 1 oscillation was induced with stochastic resonance (SR) by additive Gaussian noise at lower amplitudes, while Type 2 oscillation was observed at higher amplitudes. However, the mechanism of Type 2 oscillation is not clear. In this article, we test the hypothesis through computer simulations that the period of the Type 2 oscillation can be affected by temperature in a recurrent neural network in which the recurrent model is constructed by four Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron models. Each HH neuron model is driven by Gaussian noise and sub-threshold excitatory synaptic currents with an alpha function from another HH neuron model, and the action potentials (spike firings) of each HH neuron model are transferred to the other HH neuron model via sub-threshold synaptic currents. From spike firing times recorded, the inter spike interval (ISI) histogram was generated, and the periodicity of spike firings was detected from the ISI histogram at each HH neuron model. The results show that the probability of spike firings in the Type1 oscillation is maximized at a specific standard deviation (S.D.) of the Gaussian white noise with SR at 6.3, 15.0 and 25.0degC, while the period of the Type 2 oscillation depends on temperature. It is concluded that the Type1 oscillation can be induced by additive Gaussian white noise on the basis of a synaptic delay in the recurrent HH neuron model, whereas ISIs of the Type 2 oscillation may be determined by refractory periods of HH neuron models.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333069","Sub-threshold Synaptic Transmission;Action Potential;Stochastic Resonance;Hodgkin-Huxley model;InterSpike Intervals;Computer Simulation;Temperature;Q10","Recurrent neural networks;Neurons;White noise;Intersymbol interference;Additive white noise;Strontium;Gaussian noise;Histograms;Stochastic resonance;Additive noise","Gaussian noise;neurophysiology;physiological models;probability;recurrent neural nets","noise induced oscillations;recurrent neural networks;additive Gaussian white noise;recurrent Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model;type 1 oscillation;stochastic resonance;computer simulation;type 2 oscillation;subthreshold excitatory synaptic currents;alpha function;spike firing;interspike interval histogram;probability;refractory periods","Neural Networks (Computer);Noise","1","","10","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is shown how a modified form of controller, a PI-PD controller, which corresponds to PI control of a plant transfer function changed by the PD feedback can produce improved control in several situations. This implementation avoids the derivative kick problem associated with derivative action in the forward path, which still exists when a filter is included. Further, the PD in the inner feedback loop enables placement of the open loop poles in appropriate positions thereby providing good control for open loop system transfer functions having resonances, unstable, or integrating poles. The simulation results show significantly improved performance of the proposed control method particularly for the latter processes.","0743-1619","0-7803-4990-3","10.1109/ACC.1999.786236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=786236","","Three-term control;Open loop systems;Transfer functions;Error correction;Feedback loop;Control systems;Delay effects;Pi control;Filters;Resonance","transfer functions;feedback;three-term control;pole assignment","classical PID controllers;error signal;linear transfer function;PI-PD controller;PI control;plant transfer function;PD feedback;inner feedback loop;open loop poles","","22","","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new developments require more attention to pay to the thermal management of LEDs, commonly assessed in terms of the thermal resistance. Temperature distribution in a LED array and its effect on the chip thermal resistance has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. The thermal measurements were performed with the help of a temperature-sensitive parameter - forward voltage drop on the p-n junction under the action of heating current. Two methods of heat exciting were used: step-like or harmonically pulse-width modulated heating current. Analysis of forward voltage relaxation at transient thermal processes allows determination of thermal impedance components corresponding to the structural elements of the LEDs and arrays. The temperature distribution in the LED array predicted by coupled simulations of the heat transfer agrees well with the experimental measured temperature mapping by the IR-microscopy.","","978-1-5090-4344-6","10.1109/EuroSimE.2017.7926232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7926232","","Light emitting diodes;Temperature measurement;Thermal resistance;Temperature distribution;Heating systems;Current measurement","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;heat transfer;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;light emitting diodes;p-n junctions;pulse width modulation;temperature distribution;thermal management (packaging);thermal resistance measurement;wide band gap semiconductors","high-power AlGaInN LED arrays;temperature distribution;light emitting diodes;thermal management;chip thermal resistance;thermal measurements;temperature-sensitive parameter-forward voltage drop;p-n junction;harmonically pulse-width modulated heating current;forward voltage relaxation;transient thermal process;thermal impedance components;heat transfer;IR-microscopy;AlGaInN","","","","8","","15 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a combination of experiment and simulation was used to establish a pantograph arc ablation model, and the pantograph arc behavior was regulated by means of an external magnetic field. The study found that the arc produces directional movement under the action of the Lorentz force of the magnetic field, and disperses the energy, which can effectively reduce the ablation of the catenary wire. At the same time, as the strength of the magnetic field increased, the arc motion behavior accelerated, and the degree of electrode erosion was further dispersed.

The policy and transition dynamics from the complex simulation are in turn used to guide the learning in the physical world. A method is developed for transferring information gathered in the physical world back to the learning agent in the simulation. The new information is used to re-evaluate whether the original simulated policy is still optimal given the updated knowledge from the real-world.

The advantage of using neural nets in ATM is that the QoS can be accurately estimated without detailed user action models or knowledge about the switching system architecture. The disadvantage is that it will take longer time to train with ATM network changes. In this paper, we use genetic algorithms in neural network weights training for ATM call admission control and usage parameter control.

However, most of the information in the CNS is transmitted through supra-threshold signals and the effect of stochastic resonance in neurons on these signals is unknown. Therefore, we investigate through computer simulations whether information transmission of supra-threshold input signal can be improved by uncorrelated noise in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models by supra-threshold stochastic resonance (SSR). The mutual information was estimated as an index of information transmission via total and noise entropies from the inter-spike interval (ISI) histograms of the spike trains generated by gathering each of spike trains in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models at N = 3D1, 2, 4, 10, 20 and 50. It was shown that the mutual information was maximized at a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, i.e., a typical curve of SR was observed when the number of neurons was greater than 10 with SSR. However, SSR did not affect the information transfer with a small number of neurons. In conclusion, SSR may play an important role in processing information such as memory formation in a population of hippocampal neurons.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333973","Action Potential;supra-threshold stochastic resonance;hodgkin-huxley model;homogeneous poisson process;synaptic noise;information-theoretic analysis;numerical method;monte carlo simulation","Stochastic resonance;Neurons;Strontium;Mutual information;Signal detection;Additive noise;Background noise;Computer simulation;Noise generators;Entropy","brain;neural nets;neurophysiology;stochastic processes","stochastic resonance;supra-threshold neural signals;additive noise;hippocampal CA1 neuron models;array-enhanced stochastic resonance;interspike interval;uncorrelated noise","Animals;Electricity;Hippocampus;Membrane Potentials;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Rats;Signal Transduction;Stochastic Processes","1","","18","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the promising approaches for RTL NoC speedup is high-level modeling. Conventional high-level modeling approaches lead to an accuracy problem or modeling efforts that are caused by the absence of modeling framework or requiring in-depth knowledge of specific behaviors of target NoCs. To support cycle-accurate and formal high-level modeling framework, we propose a cellular automata (CA) modeling framework for RTL NoC. The CA abstracts detailed RTL NoC dynamics into the proposed high-level state transitions, which support flit transmission among CA components through dynamically changing flit paths based on the target RTL routing and arbitration algorithms. To prevent the meaningless execution of stable CA, the CA are designed to be triggered by state-change events. The proposed simulation engine asynchronously invokes CA to update their states and perform actions of flit transmissions or flit-path changes based on the state-decision result. To reduce the modeling difficulty, we provide a test environment that generates the state-transition rules for CA after monitoring the relationships between high-level states and leading actions under randomly injected packets during target RTL NoC simulations. Experiments demonstrate cycle-level functional homogeneity between RTL and the abstracted CA NoC models and significant simulation speedup.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962253","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; Ministry of Education; Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute; Korean Government; Development of Flexible Simulation Learning Management Platform for Mixed Real-Virtual Data.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8943201","Network on chip;cellular automata;RTL design;test-driven rule generation;event-based simulation","Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Automata;Mathematical model;Routing;Computational modeling;Indexes","cellular automata;high level synthesis;network-on-chip;optimisation","dynamically changing flit paths;arbitration algorithms;state-change events;flit transmission;flit-path changes;state-decision result;state-transition rules;high-level states;significant simulation speedup;RTL NoC designs;register-transfer level simulation;network-on-chip;RTL NoC speedup;high-level modeling;formal high-level modeling framework;cellular automata;RTL NoC dynamics;high-level state transitions;RTL NoC simulations;test-driven cellular automata;cycle-level functional;random injected packet","","1","","23","CCBY","25 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the electric field, the bubble is elongated along the field lines under the action of electrostriction forces. This leads to the increase of the field magnitude near the poles of the bubble. Since the electric strength of the gas phase is much lower than the one of the liquid phase, the electric breakdown becomes possible inside the bubble with generation of conducting substance. Electric currents produce heat, and the temperature inside and around the conducting bubble rises leading to the evaporation of liquid and further increase of conductivity. Breakdown in a cavity leads to the increase of electric field magnitude in neighbor ones, which results in the sequence of breakdowns in nearby cavities. This is the ""relay-race"" mechanism of breakdown.

TERL architecture is based on a RL actor-critic model where both actor and critic have a hierarchical structure, inspired by the mixture-of-experts model, formed by a gating network that selects experts specializing in learning the policies or value functions of different tasks. A key feature of TERL is the capacity of its gating networks to accumulate, in parallel, evidence on the capacity of experts to solve the new tasks so as to increase the responsibility for action of the best ones. A second key feature is the use of two different responsibility signals for the experts' functioning and learning: this allows the training of multiple experts for each task so that some of them can be later recruited to solve new tasks and avoid catastrophic interference. The utility of TERL mechanisms is shown with tests involving two simulated dynamic robot arms engaged in solving reaching tasks, in particular a planar 2-DoF arm, and a 3-D 4-DoF arm.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2016.2607018","European Commission; ICT Challenge 2 “Cognitive Systems and Robotics” through the Project “IM-CLeVeR—Intrinsically Motivated Cumulative Learning Versatile Robots”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7592409","Autonomous robotics;bio-inspired modular neural architecture;catastrophic interference;cumulative learning;functioning and learning responsibility signals;mixture-of-expert networks;reaching tasks;transfer reinforcement learning (TRL)","Biological system modeling;Computer architecture;Learning (artificial intelligence);Manipulators;Brain modeling;Organisms","knowledge management;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics","gating network;TERL mechanisms;reinforcement learning architecture;extraordinary capacity;bio-inspired reinforcement-learning modular architecture;skill-to-skill knowledge transfer;transfer expert RL model;TERL architecture;RL actor-critic model;mixture-of-experts model;responsibility signals;planar 2-DoF arm;3-DoF arm;4-DoF arm","","4","","101","","14 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has led to the use of controlled input signals obtained through excitation instrumentation whose production may prove very costly. Some newly developed techniques exploit the natural excitation that any structure is subjected to, and therefore do no require any special instrumentation. Some of them are based on an analysis of the response signal in the time domain and on the determination of a time series approximating its evolution through the use of appropriate statistical models, whilst some others use the concept of a random decrement function to extend the applicability domain of techniques that originally had been designed to analyse free-decay response signals. The techniques previously mentioned typically require the hypothesis of stationarity, though the field of civil engineering excitations is generally non-stationary. This consideration prompted some proposals for new identification methods designed to handle these types of non-stationary excitation, which are based on special amplitude and phase estimators defined in the time-frequency domain. The advantage of these methods is that identification is based solely on the properties of the modal signals, that are dealt with as modulated harmonics. This paper briefly summarises the hypotheses and theories that constitute the basis of the main ""output-only"" techniques. The problems usually encountered in this kind of identification are stated and critically discussed. The final part of the paper reports a few numerical simulations.","0743-1619","0-7803-6495-3","10.1109/ACC.2001.945585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945585","","Time frequency analysis;Instruments;Signal analysis;Time series analysis;Transfer functions;Production;Time domain analysis;Signal design;Civil engineering;Proposals","identification;time-frequency analysis;civil engineering;transfer functions;dynamic response","output-only dynamic identification;time-frequency domain;transfer functions;structural identification procedures;forcing actions;controlled input signals;excitation instrumentation;response signal analysis;statistical models;random decrement function;applicability domain;free-decay response signals;stationarity;civil engineering;nonstationary excitations;amplitude estimators;phase estimators;modal signals;modulated harmonics;numerical simulations","","2","","11","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The final objective is to present timely information about transfer limits and stability margins and eventually implement corrective actions.

During this period of time the loading and configuration conditions of the system change significantly but not drastically. We verify that the set of the relevant contingencies remains almost the same in the time interval comprised between two cycles of the functions associated to DSA. Parallel-in-time formulated algorithms can be used in tracking the load conditions in real time adopting as initial guess for the simulation of each contingency, the trajectories obtained for the same contingency at the previous cycle of DSA functions (that is the ones calculated in the previous 15 minutes). In this way, the information obtained In a previous cycle of DCA is not lost completely as in step-by step algorithms.

While many studies in RL focus on varying the observation space or reward model, few efforts focused on the choice of action space (e.g. joint or end-effector space, position, velocity, etc.). However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space that conforms to the characteristics of the task can simplify exploration and improve robustness to disturbances. This paper studies the effect of different action spaces in deep RL and advocates for variable impedance control in end-effector space (VICES) as an advantageous action space for constrained and contact-rich tasks. We evaluate multiple action spaces on three prototypical manipulation tasks: Path Following (task with no contact), Door Opening (task with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact). We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy consumption, and ensures safety across all three experimental setups. Further, RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in simulation, and from simulation to real for the same robot.

Harmonic pollution has become an important factor affecting the normal operation of power equipment. In this paper, the temperature rise of solid insulated energy transfer equipment under harmonic actions is studied. Firstly, the load losses calculation model of dry-type transformer is established by analyzing the action mechanism of harmonic interference on each component. Secondly, the simulation model of temperature field distribution of dry-type transformer is established. Finally, combined with load loss calculation model and temperature field distribution simulation model, the actual operation of transformer is calculated and analyzed. The results show that the additional temperature rise caused by harmonic losses is mainly concentrated on windings and insulating resins. Moreover, if the dry-type transformer operates under the condition of serious current distortion for a long time, the aging of insulation material will accelerate and the insulation performance of transformer will be reduced.","","978-1-7281-3137-5","10.1109/EI247390.2019.9061739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9061739","harmonic disturbance;load loss;temperature field distribution","Power transformer insulation;Harmonic analysis;Windings;Heating systems;Power system harmonics;Transformer cores;Load modeling","losses;power apparatus;power grids;power system harmonics;power transformers;resins;transformer windings","solid insulation structure;dry-type transformer;power grid structure;temperature rise;solid insulated energy transfer equipment;harmonic actions;load losses calculation model;temperature field distribution;load loss calculation model","","","","13","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when the predictive model is unavailable or unpromising for long time step predictions, model-free approaches could be considered as a possible way to achieve efficient control. Since most existing model-free approaches are focused on control of small canals or reservoirs, this article proposes a new control approach named policy and action reinforcement learning (PARL) for large-scale canals. We leverage the idea of “divide and conquer” to decompose the control task of large-scale canals into policy learning and action learning subtasks, and develop PARL by means of hierarchical reinforcement learning.

In order to achieve these objectives, it is necessary to streamline the design and development process, namely, “transfer of analytical design of Intelligence to Mechatronics intelligence” in an efficient and expedient manner. An increasing pressure exists on the development cycle of control systems to serve this widening application spectrum. The time-to-market of a new product often determines its commercial success. Consequently, design problems have to be discovered as early as possible in the design process in order to take remedial actions. Efficient and accurate tools and procedures are required to support short yet successful development processes. Over the last two decades, commercially available computer has become both increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable. This, in turn, has led to the emergence of highly sophisticated simulation software applications that not only enable high-fidelity simulation of dynamic systems and related controls, but also automatic code generation for implementation in industrial controllers. Simulation tools have been widely used for the design and improvement of electrical systems since the mid twentieth century. The evolution of simulation tools has progressed in step with the evolution of computing technologies. In last ten years, computing technologies have improved dramatically in performance and become widely available at a steadily decreasing cost. Consequently, simulation tools have also seen dramatic performance gains and steady cost decreases. Researchers and engineers now have access to affordable, high-performance simulation tools that were previously too cost prohibitive, except for the largest manufacturers and utilities.

Unfortunately, due to the large anatomical and physiological variations across individuals, a patient-specific model is necessary for an accurate localization. Such models are difficult to implement in clinical practice because the training data on each patient have to be obtained through invasive and expensive procedures. This paper proposes to overcome this shortage of clinical data by transferring the knowledge extracted from a large set of patient-specific simulation data to a small set of clinical data on the patient. A domain adaption approach is used to learn the ""domain shift"" between simulation and clinical data, while a novel error modeling method is developed to take into account potential simulation errors during domain adaption. The presented method is evaluated on three PVC patients. In comparison to training a patient-specific model purely from clinical data, or a combination of simulation and clinical data without considering domain shift, the presented method is able to improve the localization accuracy, especially when there is only a small number of clinical data available for training.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-3636-7","10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363814","Domain adaptation;patient-specific model;premature ventricular contraction;electrocardiograms","Data models;Adaptation models;Electrocardiography;Support vector machines;Training data;Training;Action potentials","electrocardiography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;medical signal processing","patient-specific model;data-driven model;abnormal ventricular activation;patient-specific simulation data;error modeling method","","","","16","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SR can also improve the transmission of information within single neurons. Since information processing in the brain is carried out by neural networks and noise is present throughout the brain, the hypothesis that noise and coupling play an important role in the control of information processing within a population of neurons to control was tested. Using computer simulations, we investigate the effect of noise on the transmission of information in an array of neurons, known as array-enhanced SR (AESR) in an interconnected population of hippocampal neurons. A subthreshold synaptic current (signal) modeled by a filtered homogeneous Poisson process was applied to a distal position in each of the apical dendrites, while background synaptic signals (uncorrelated noise) were presented to the midpoint in the basal dendrite. The transmembrane potentials were recorded in each cell of an array of CA1 neuron models, in order to determine spike firing times and to estimate the total and noise entropies from the spike firing times. The results show that the mutual information is maximized for a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, implying the presence of AESR. The results also show that the maximum mutual information increases with increased numbers of neurons and the strength of connections. Moreover, the relative levels of excitation and inhibition modulate the mutual information transfer. It is concluded that uncorrelated noise can enhance information transmission of subthreshold synaptic input currents in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models. Therefore, endogenous neural noise could play an important role in neural tissue by modulating the transfer of information across the network.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2126571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738322","Action potential;Hodgkin–Huxley model;Monte Carlo simulation;numerical method;Poisson shot noise;stochastic resonance (SR);synaptic noise","Neurons;Noise;Mutual information;Couplings;Strontium;Entropy;Binary sequences","bioelectric potentials;biological tissues;biomembrane transport;brain;entropy;filtering theory;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;shot noise;stochastic processes","stochastic resonance;information transmission;neural networks;noise-induced phenomenon;signal detection;background noise;brain;array-enhanced SR;hippocampal neurons;subthreshold synaptic current;filtered homogeneous Poisson process;apical dendrites;background synaptic signals;basal dendrite;transmembrane potentials;biological cells;CA1 neuron models;spike firing times;noise entropy;mutual information;endogenous neural noise;neural tissue","Action Potentials;Animals;CA1 Region, Hippocampal;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Monte Carlo Method;Nerve Net;Poisson Distribution;Rats;Stochastic Processes;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles","29","","46","","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous synthetic studies have focused on modeling the developmental process of joint attention and have proposed learning methods without any explicit instructions for joint attention. The causal structure between a perception variable (the caregiver's face directions or individual objects) and an action variable (gaze shift to the caregiver's face or object locations) is given in advance to learn joint attention. However, such a structure is expected to be found by the robot through the interaction experiences. This paper investigates how the transfer entropy, that is an information theoretic measure, can be used to quantify the causality inherent in the face-to-face interaction. In the computer simulation of human-robot interaction, we examined which pair of perceptions and actions are selected as the causal pair and showed that the selected pairs can be used to learn a sensorimotor map for achieving joint attention.","2161-9476","978-1-4244-1115-3","10.1109/DEVLRN.2007.4354069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4354069","joint attention;transfer entropy;contingency learning","Entropy;Robot kinematics;Humans;Pediatrics;Robot sensing systems;Robotics and automation;Object detection;Learning systems;Computer simulation;Buildings","entropy;robot vision","causality detection;transfer entropy leads acquisition;joint attention;human-robot communication;information theoretic measure;face-to-face interaction","","11","","9","","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Effect of gas discharge and magnetic field on plasma layer at the surface in gas flow","I. V. Schweigert","ITAM SB RAS, Institutskaya 4/1, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia","2013 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)","17 Oct 2013","2013","","","1","1","Summary form only given. When returning to the Earth, the spacecrafts enter the upper atmospheric layers with a hypersonic speed. In this case, the shock heated air around them becomes weakly ionized. The gas ionization behind the shock front is associative in nature and occurs through chemical reactions between fragments of molecules. The formation of a plasma layer near the surfaces of spacecraft causes serious problems related to the blocking of communication channels with the Earth and other spacecraft. A promising way of restoring the radio communications is the application of electrical and magnetic fields for controlling the plasma layer parameters. Sheaths with an almost zero electron density and a high ion density are known to be formed near a surface when an ac or dc gas discharge is ignited in a plasma. Since the electromagnetic waves interact mainly with the plasma electron component, a decrease in electron density ensures the passage of the electromagnetic waves through the plasma sheath. In this work, we consider the combined action of a direct current (DC) discharge and a magnetic field on the plasma flow near a flat surface at a low gas pressure. Our simulations ar e performed using a two dimensional Particle in cell method (PIC MCC). The kinetics of electrons in nitrogen includes elastic collisions, the excitation of rotational, vibrational, and meta stable levels, and ionization. Based on two dimensional kinetic PIC MCC simulations, we considered the possibility of locally controlling the plasma sheath parameters near a flat surface i n a hypersonic flow. We showed that the combined action of D C discharge, a constant voltage, and a magnetic field on the plasma sheath allows the local electron density to be reduced manyfold. We did not consider the effect of gas flow acceleration during the momentum transfer from ions to gas molecules under resonant charge exchange. The gas flow velocity distribution is specified by a model function.","0730-9244","978-1-4673-5171-3","10.1109/PLASMA.2013.6634914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634914","","Plasmas;Discharges (electric);Magnetic fields;Surface discharges;Fluid flow;Earth;Space vehicles","discharges (electric);ignition;nitrogen;plasma density;plasma electromagnetic wave propagation;plasma kinetic theory;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation","plasma electron component;electron density;direct current discharge;plasma flow;low gas pressure;plasma simulation;two-dimensional particle in cell method;electrons kinetics;nitrogen;elastic collision;rotational excitation level;metastable level;ionization;two-dimensional kinetic PIC MCC simulation;hypersonic flow;discharge;constant voltage;ion-gas molecule momentum transfer;resonant charge exchange;gas flow velocity distribution;electromagnetic wave interaction;ignition;ac gas discharge;dc gas discharge;plasma sheath parameter;high ion density;zero electron density;plasma layer parameter;magnetic fields;electrical fields;radio communication;communication channel;plasma layer formation;chemical reactions;gas ionization;weakly ionization;shock heated air;hypersonic speed;atmospheric layers;spacecraft;Earth;gas flow surface;magnetic field effects;gas discharge effect;N2","","","","","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A rotary-arc gap switch (RAG) is the switch form that can reduce the electrode erosion through the fast rotation of the arc. A RAG with a coaxial cylindrical structure is designed in this paper, mainly composed of two electrodes and two coils. The finite-element-analysis software Ansoft is used to simulate and analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of the switch. The simulation shows that the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the coils is symmetric and is with a mirrorlike structure. The existence of the electrodes will weaken the magnetic field because of the reaction of the eddy currents. Cutting the electrodes is the way to solve the problem, and cutting the outer electrode is much more valid than cutting the inner electrode. However, the number of slots in the outer electrode does not influence much. When the RAG works, the arc will rotate fast around the inner electrode due to the action of a Lorentz force under the axial magnetic field, as is convenient to reduce the electrode erosion and prolong the life of the switch. The high-current experiments show that the RAG can withstand very high current and very high charge transfer with very slight electrode erosion.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2010.2055245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524014","Electromagnetic simulation;finite-element analysis;pulsed power switch;rotary-arc gap switch (RAG)","Analytical models;Electromagnetic analysis;Electrodes;Switches;Magnetic fields;Coils;Coaxial components;Finite element methods;Magnetic analysis;Eddy currents","eddy currents;electrodes;finite element analysis;power engineering computing;pulsed power switches","electromagnetic simulation;rotary-arc gap switch analysis;electrode erosion;pulsed power switches;RAG;coaxial cylindrical structure;finite-element-analysis software Ansoft;electromagnetic characteristics;magnetic field distribution;mirrorlike structure;eddy currents;Lorentz force;axial magnetic field;charge transfer","","1","","7","","26 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A SOSM controller implemented by a digital state machine is designed to regulate the output voltage of ICPT systems by controlling the switches on the primary side. Parameters of the controller are derived with a simplified dc equivalent circuit model of the ICPT system. The proposed controller achieves fast dynamic response, robustness against load disturbances and parameter uncertainties without requiring current sensing or any integral terms in the controller. As a result, the output voltage of the system can reach steady state without any overshoots in several switching actions under load disturbances or mutual inductance variations.

This method integrates the selection of the spatial filters for signal detection to the estimation of CV. Using this approach, in this paper, we propose a novel technique for signal-based selection of the spatial filter pair that minimizes the effect of nonpropagating signal components (end-of-fiber effects) on CV estimates (optimal filters). The technique is applicable to signals with one propagating and one nonpropagating component, such as single motor unit action potentials. It is shown that the determination of the optimal filters also allows the identification of the propagating and nonpropagating signal components. The new method was applied to simulated and experimental EMG signals. Simulated signals were generated by a cylindrical, layered volume conductor model. Experimental signals were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis with a linear array of 16 electrodes. In the simulations, the proposed approach provided CV estimates with lower bias due to nonpropagating signal components than previously proposed methods based on the entire signal waveform. In the experimental signals, the technique separated propagating and nonpropagating signal components with an average reconstruction error of 2.9plusmn0.9% of the signal energy. The technique may find application in single motor unit studies for decreasing the variability and bias of CV estimates due to the presence and different weights of the nonpropagating components","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.881760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703747","Conduction velocity;linear electrode arrays;spatial filtering","Electromyography;Spatial filters;Signal detection;Tendons;Transfer functions;Electrodes;Costs;Muscles;Optical fiber sensors;Signal processing","electromyography;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;signal reconstruction;source separation;spatial filters","motor unit conduction velocity;surface EMG recordings;electromagnetic signals;signal-based selection;spatial filter transfer function;muscle fiber conduction velocity;temporal filters;signal detection;propagating signal components;nonpropagating signal components;optimal filters;single motor unit action potentials;cylindrical layered volume conductor model;abductor pollicis brevis;signal separation;signal reconstruction","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electromyography;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Neurons;Muscle Fibers, Skeletal;Neural Conduction;Neuromuscular Junction;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","15","","19","","18 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To better understand this unexpected adaptive capacity in brain-lesioned patients, we investigated the contribution of awareness for the optical shift to the development of prism adaptation. The lack of awareness found in neglect was simulated in a multiple-step group where healthy subjects remained unaware of the optical deviation because of its progressive stepwise increase from 2° to 10°. We contrasted this method with the classical single-step group in which subjects were aware of the visual shift because they were directly exposed to the full 10° shift. Because the number of pointing trials was identical in the two groups, the total amount of deviation exposure was 50% larger in the single-step group. Negative after-effects were examined with an open-loop pointing task performed with the adapted hand, and generalization was tested with open-loop pointing with the nonexposed hand to visual and auditory targets. The robustness of adaptation was assessed by an open-loop pointing task after a simple de-adaptation procedure. The progressive, unaware condition was associated with larger negative after-effects, transfer to the non-exposed hand for the visual and auditory pointing tasks, and greater robustness. The amount of adaptation obtained remained, nevertheless, lower than the exaggerated adaptive capacity seen in patients with neglect. Implications for the functional mechanisms and the anatomical substrates of prism adaptation are discussed.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.2007.19.2.341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6794480","","","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In previous works, it has been shown how the bilateral passivity controller (BiPC) can preserve stability when the communication channel that conveys data between master and slave is affected by delay. In this work the authors intend to further explore the possibilities offered by the Bilateral Energy Transfer concept as design guideline, and to refine the control schemes already discussed in. The underlying idea of the Bilateral Energy Transfer is to achieve a transport of energy between the two sides of the real system as faithful to an ldquoidealrdquo (not delayed) system as allowed by the energy leaks. As energy leak is meant the behavior introduced by the not ideality of some components, such as the communication channel. At the same time, in order to obtain easy-to-use system, the control system must preserve, in some extend, the force, velocity, and position correspondences between master and slave. In order to achieve this goal, a modified version of passivity controller is presented. Its main characteristic is that its correction action aimed at dissipating energy, regarded as generated by energy leaks, is limited and deferred in time. Moreover, a drift compensator is introduced whose role is to solve a drift in position introduced by the operation of the same BiPC; in order to maintain the whole system passive, the action of this controller is bounded to the amount of energy that has been dissipated in excess by the BiPC.","","978-1-4244-3858-7","10.1109/WHC.2009.4810869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810869","","Energy exchange;Haptic interfaces;Communication system control;Master-slave;Stability;Communication channels;Control systems;Guidelines;Delay systems;Force control","haptic interfaces;stability","bilateral energy transfer;haptic telemanipulation;stability;bilateral time domain passivity;force signals;velocity signals;bilateral passivity controller;communication channel","","5","","12","","3 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then use the rest of each recording to assess the model's accuracy in predicting spike timing, rhythm, and interspike intervals. We show that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the predicted spikes remains inside the 95% confidence interval of the CDF of the recorded spikes.

Methods: The auto-regressive discrete acquisition points transformation (ADAPT) method is an adaption of the auto-regressive moving average system, which allows for the modeling of multi-exponential data and enables the estimation of the number of exponential components without prior assumptions. ADAPT was evaluated on simulated DW-MRI data. The optimum ADAPT fit was then applied to human brain DWI data and the correlation between the ADAPT coefficients and the parameters of the commonly used bi-exponential intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) method were investigated. Results: The ADAPT method can correctly identify the number of components and model the exponential data. The ADAPT coefficients were found to have strong correlations with the IVIM parameters. ADAPT(1,1)-β0 correlated with IVIM-D: ρ = 0.708, P <; 0.001. ADAPT(1,1)-α1 correlated with IVIM-f: ρ = 0.667, P <; 0.001. ADAPT(1,1)-β1 correlated with IVIM-D*: ρ = 0.741, P <; 0.001).

These artifacts can take the form of blurring or aliasing of the moving structures in different parts of the image. Solutions proposed to date include retrospective or prospective gating. Although these techniques are routinely used in clinical practice, they have the drawback of increasing overall acquisition duration. More elaborated methods consist in using 4D MRI datasets to extract spatial deformations for respiratory motion correction performed during PET image reconstruction. The drawbacks of such methods include time consuming acquisitions as well as the need for fast 3D MRI acquisitions leading to reduced tissue contrast. The objective of this work is to overcome these limitations by the use of a generalized reconstruction by inversion of coupled systems (GRICS) approach in order to obtain internal MRI structure motion and associated deformation matrices for use in PET respiratory motion correction. The GRICS method consists in formulating parallel MRI in the presence of patient motion as a coupled inverse problem. Its resolution, using a fixed-point method, allows the reconstructed image to be improved using a motion model constructed from the raw MR data, irrespectively of the MR sequence used. This method was tested on two different MR volunteer datasets. It was compared with the use of 4D MR acquisitions, and evaluated within the context of correcting simulated PET image frames for respiratory motion. Our results indicate that using GRICS is an efficient method for PET respiratory motion correction in combined PET/MRI imaging without the need for 4D MR acquisitions and associated specific MR sequences.","1082-3654","978-1-4673-2030-6","10.1109/NSSMIC.2012.6551641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6551641","","","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;deformation;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;image sequences;medical image processing;positron emission tomography","generic PET-MRI respiratory motion correction;generalized reconstruction;coupled system approach;multimodality imaging;PET-CT imaging;moving structures;prospective gating;retrospective gating;4D MRI datasets;PET image reconstruction;3D MRI acquisitions;biological tissue;GRICS approach;internal MRI structure motion;associated deformation matrices;fixed-point method;MR sequence;4D MR acquisition","","5","","11","","8 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, assuming a Rician noise model, a new filtering method based on the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation is introduced, which employs the self-similarity property of the MR data to restore the noise-less signal. This method takes into account the structural characteristics of images and the Bayesian mean square error (Bmse) of the estimator to address the denoising problem. In general, a twofold data processing approach is developed; first, the noisy MR data is processed using a patch-based L2-norm similarity measure to provide the primary set of samples required for the estimation process. Afterwards, the Bmse of the estimator is derived as the optimization function to analyze the pre-selected samples and minimize the error between the estimated and the underlying signal. Compared to the LMMSE method and also its recently proposed SNR-adapted realization (SNLMMSE), the optimized way of choosing the samples together with the automatic adjustment of the filtering parameters lead to a more robust estimation performance with our approach. Experimental results show the competitive performance of the proposed method in comparison with related state-of-the-art methods.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2344675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6872528","Denoising;data redundancy;LMMSE estimation;MRI;rician noise","Noise;Estimation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Rician channels;Noise reduction;Filtering;Noise measurement","Bayes methods;biomedical MRI;data acquisition;image denoising;image filtering;mean square error methods;medical image processing;optimisation","optimized LMMSE based method;3D MRI denoising;post-acquisition denoising;magnetic resonance images;acquired data;Rician noise model;filtering method;linear minimum mean square error estimation;self-similarity property;noise-less signal;structural characteristics;Bayesian mean square error;twofold data processing approach;noisy MR data;patch-based L2-norm similarity measure;SNR-adapted realization;robust estimation performance","Bayes Theorem;Brain;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Signal-To-Noise Ratio","9","","45","","6 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The closed-form analytical solution to the specific motion planning problem has demonstrated a reliable performance controlling the robot to move towards the expected scanning areas and the calculated proximity of the robot to the surface shows that the robot maintains a safe distance while moving around the abdomen. The volunteer study has successfully demonstrated the reliable working and controllability of the robot in terms of acquiring desired ultrasound views.

The waveform description style provided by the WAVES specification supports an information model which captures all the information in the simulator stimulus languages and tester test vector languages, including multilevel value systems, tester formats, repeat and branch capabilities, and hierarchical test organization. The WAVES representation is thus a universal acceptor for simulation and test waveform information.

In recent years the idea of using video game technology in surgical education for laparoscopy has also been explored, however few have attempted to make a connection between video game experience and robotic surgical skills. Thus, the current study aims to examine the performance of video gamers in a virtual reality robotic surgery simulator. Furthermore, the video gamers' performance was compared to that of medical students, expert robotic surgeons, and “laypeople.” The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that video gamers acquire perceptual and psychomotor skills through video game play, similar to those used by robotic surgeons. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and performed three computer-based perceptual tests: a Flanker compatibility task, a subsidizing task, and a Multiple Object Tracking test. Participants then performed two warm-up exercises and eight trials of two core exercises on a robotic surgery simulator. After completing all trials, participants completed a post-questionnaire regarding their experience with the system. Expert video gamers (n=40), medical students (n=24), laypeople (n=42) and expert robotic surgeons (n=16) were recruited. Medical students and gamers were significantly faster than experts in the Flanker Task. The experts were significantly slower than the all other groups in the subsidizing task. Experts scored significantly higher, were significantly more efficient, and were significantly faster than laypeople, medical students, and gamers in the first trial of Ring & Rail 1 and Suture Sponge. In trial eight of the simulation exercises, the experts performed significantly better than most groups in all of the metrics. Contrary to prior literature in laparoscopy, this study was unable to validate enhanced abilities of video gamers in a robotic surgery simulator. This study does further demonstrate that the transfer of skills developed through video game play is relevant to the surgical technique. This may be due to the differences of the systems and how the users interact within them. In a society where video games have become an integral past time, it is important to determine the role that video games play in the perceptual and psychomotor development of users. These findings can be generalized to domains outside of medicine that utilize robotic and computer-controlled systems, speaking to the scope of the gamers' abilities and pointing to the capacity within these systems.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586262","","Surgery;Robots;Measurement;Games;Training;Rails;Cameras","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational robots;human-robot interaction;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery;virtual reality","video game experience;basic robotic skills;virtual reality robotic surgery simulator;standardized robotic surgery skill training;objective robotic surgery skill training;standardized robotic surgery skill assessment;objective robotic surgery skill assessment;surgical education;laparoscopy;video game technology;perceptual skill acquisition;psychomotor skill acquisition;computer-based perceptual tests;flanker compatibility task;subsidizing task;multiple object tracking test;computer-controlled systems","","1","","17","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Case studies show that the proposed pattern recognition scheme can successfully find out the relationships between the pre-contingency steady state quantities and the stability indices under each specified fault. According to the spatial description of the obtained patterns in the feature space, the transient stability levels can be predicted according to the system operation states. Thus the TSA scheme obtained can not only predict the stability index, such as the CCT value, of faults but also offer instability preventive control strategies.

The setup allows acoustic data acquisition for simultaneous B-mode image formation and the tomographic sound velocity reconstruction. In order to improve the sound velocity estimation accuracy, a new reconstruction algorithm based on a convex programming formulation has been developed. Extensive simulations for both imaging and time-of-flight data based on a 5-MHz linear array were performed on tissues with different geometries and acoustic parameters. Results show that the sound velocity error was generally 1-3 m/s, with a maximum of 5.8 m/s. The radii of the objects under investigation varied from 2 to 6 mm, and all of them were detected successfully. Thus, the proposed approach has been shown to be both feasible and accurate.

The particular functions of such an expert system are reduced to the monitoring and supervision processes. While some software packages allow the monitoring function to be made practical, real time supervision of dynamic systems arises as an attempt to aid the human operator in developing its functions, constituting the main way to guarantee the quality of the system response. Guaranteeing the constraints about the response time of the expert system demands adequate information in an optimal state of processing about the functions of the control system. A generic expert system model to implement the monitoring and supervision functions based on inductive learning techniques, together with a data structure to store information from the expert and the control systems, called evolutionary database for supervision, are presented.","1062-922X","0-7803-4053-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1997.638369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=638369","","Expert systems;Real time systems;Process control;Control systems;Monitoring;Software packages;Humans;Delay;Optimal control;Data structures","process control;expert systems;intelligent control;computerised monitoring;real-time systems;deductive databases;knowledge acquisition","real time control;monitoring;supervisory control;expert system;dynamic system;system response;inductive learning;data structure;evolutionary database;process control;knowledge acquisition","","3","","16","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2019.2930586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770102","MR spectroscopic imaging;spectroscopy;low-dimensionalmodels;neural network;manifold learning;spatiospectral constraint","Data models;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Imaging;Neural networks;Manifolds;Signal to noise ratio","biomedical MRI;data acquisition;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","SNR tradeoffs;low-dimensional model;imaging problem;nonlinear low-dimensional representation;low-dimensional manifold;high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside;physics-based data acquisition model;MRSI reconstruction;constrained magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging;molecular imaging modality;MRSI data","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Neural Networks, Computer;Nonlinear Dynamics","1","","58","CCBY","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High-speed refresh rate, generally 1 kHz, is required to present stiff virtual objects that have spring-damper characteristic with haptic display. On the other hand, the managing of an interactive and rich virtual world that takes a lot of computational time makes the refresh rate as low as 10 Hz, which is enough for perceptual cycle. The dividing of the process into two has been proposed to interact with such a world and inter-process communication between the processes has been discussed. Although the methods proposed previously work well on condition that the virtual world is static, goes wrong on dynamic world. The importance of the integrated force on the object motion acquisition is described and an inter-process communication that cares about the integrated force is proposed to remove the influence of the sampling timing.

While the former approach is highly subjective, the latter is commonly plagued by one or more of the following major problems: (1) an inconsistent rulebase; (2) the need for prior knowledge such as the number of clusters to be computed; (3) heuristically designed knowledge acquisition methodologies; and (4) the stability-plasticity tradeoff of the system. This paper presents a novel self-organizing neural fuzzy system, named Self-Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Network (SaFIN), to address the aforementioned deficiencies. The proposed SaFIN model employs a new clustering technique referred to as categorical learning-induced partitioning (CLIP), which draws inspiration from the behavioral category learning process demonstrated by humans. By employing the one-pass CLIP, SaFIN is able to incorporate new clusters in each input-output dimension when the existing clusters are not able to give a satisfactory representation of the incoming training data. This not only avoids the need for prior knowledge regarding the number of clusters needed for each input-output dimension, but also allows SaFIN the flexibility to incorporate new knowledge with old knowledge in the system. In addition, the self-automated rule formation mechanism proposed within SaFIN ensures that it obtains a consistent resultant rulebase. Subsequently, the proposed SaFIN model is employed in a series of benchmark simulations to demonstrate its efficiency as a self-organizing neural fuzzy system, and excellent performances have been achieved.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2167720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051517","Categorical learning-induced partitioning;fuzzy neural networks;hybrid intelligent systems;self-organizing","Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy neural networks;Computational modeling;Training data;Learning systems","expert systems;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","self adaptive fuzzy inference network;neural fuzzy system;human expert;numerical training data;inconsistent rule base;heuristically designed knowledge acquisition methodology;stability-plasticity tradeoff;self organizing neural fuzzy system;SaFIN model;clustering technique;categorical learning induced partitioning;category learning process;CLIP;input-output dimension;self automated rule formation mechanism;consistent resultant rule base","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Expert Systems;Feedback;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Neural Networks (Computer)","34","","44","","18 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, several reconstruction strategies have been recently proposed, which aim to recover the missing information either by exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations of the image series, or by imposing suitable constraints on the reconstructed image volume. The main contribution of this paper is to combine both these strategies in a compressed sensing framework by exploiting the gradient sparsity of the image volume. The resulting constrained 3D minimization problem is then solved using a penalized forward-backward splitting approach that leads to a convergent iterative two-step procedure. In the first step, the updating rule accords with the sequential nature of the data acquisitions, in the second step a truly 3D filtering strategy exploits the spatio-temporal correlations of the image sequences. The resulting NFCS-3D algorithm is very general and suitable for several kinds of medical image reconstruction problems. Moreover, it is fast, stable and yields very good reconstructions, even in the case of highly undersampled image sequences. The results of several numerical experiments highlight the optimal performance of the proposed algorithm and confirm that it is competitive with state of the art algorithms.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2068306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551207","Compressed sensing (CS);medical image sequences;nonlinear filters;splitting methods;total variation minimization","Image reconstruction;Three dimensional displays;Minimization;Noise measurement;Compressed sensing;Biomedical imaging;Convergence","biomedical MRI;data acquisition;image reconstruction;image sequences;medical image processing;spatiotemporal phenomena","fast compressed sensing approach;3D MR image reconstruction;high-resolution image volume reconstruction;reduced frequency acquisition sequences;medical diagnosis;gradient sparsity;3D minimization problem;penalized forward-backward splitting approach;data acquisition;3D filtering strategy;spatiotemporal correlations;medical image reconstruction problems;state of the art algorithms","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Fourier Analysis;Heart;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Phantoms, Imaging","37","","30","","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources.

In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes.

In both cases, a learner has to resolve concurrently multiple types of ambiguities while learning how to act in response to particular contexts through the observation of a teacher's demonstrations. We argue that computational models of language acquisition and models of motor skill learning by demonstration have so far only considered distinct subsets of these types of ambiguities, leading to the use of distinct families of techniques across two loosely connected research domains. We present a computational model, mixing concepts and techniques from these two domains, involving a simulated robot learner interacting with a human teacher. Proof-of-concept experiments show that: 1) it is possible to consider simultaneously a larger set of ambiguities than considered so far in either domain; and 2) this allows us to model important aspects of language acquisition and motor learning within a single process that does not initially separate what is “linguistic” from what is “nonlinguistic.” Rather, the model shows that a general form of imitation learning can allow a learner to discover channels of communication used by an ambiguous teacher, thus addressing a form of abstract Gavagai problem (ambiguity about which observed behavior is “linguistic”, and in that case which modality is communicative).","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2013.2279277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588874","Discovering linguistic channels;imitation learning;language acquisition;motor Gavagai problem;robot learning by demonstration;sensorimotor learning","Context;Pragmatics;Acoustic waves;Computational modeling;Speech;Robot sensing systems","human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;robot programming","motor learning by demonstration;ambiguous teacher;simulated robot learner;proof-of-concept experiments;motor skill learning;teacher demonstrations;human teachers;multiple context-dependent sensorimotor skills;language acquisition;Gavagai problem;nonlinguistic sensorimotor skills;multiple linguistic skills;unified imitation learning","","2","","69","","4 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, there are only a few experiences of combining CAL tools with practical experiments. This is the particular case of electronics where practical education is based on traditional independent instruments and CAL tools are use for simulation only. A new approach of CAL tools in electronics is the virtual instrumentation technique. Virtual instruments result from the combination of a general purpose computer with a generic data acquisition system in order to emulate several traditional measurement instruments. Virtual instruments are characterized by their versatility and low cost so they are very suitable for educational applications. Nevertheless, the operation rate of these instruments is limited by the general-purpose orientation of the hardware. In this work, the authors propose a new solution for the implementation of virtual instruments based on reconfigurable data acquisition systems. The whole system is characterized by its versatility because software and hardware modules change dynamically according to the application requirements. By this way, virtual instruments provides a link between CAL tools and the external systems used in practical experiments.","","0-7695-0312-8","10.1109/MSE.1999.787019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=787019","","Instruments;Reconfigurable logic;Application software;Costs;Electronic switching systems;Consumer electronics;Microcomputers;Manufacturing;Laboratories;System testing","electronic engineering education;electronic engineering computing;virtual instrumentation;microcomputer applications;computer aided instruction;data acquisition","virtual instruments;reconfigurable logic;educational applications;computer assisted learning;personal computers;electronics education;virtual instrumentation technique;reconfigurable data acquisition system;operation rate;software;hardware;CAI tools","","4","","1","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is challenging to obtain 3-D motion estimates due to a tradeoff between image slice density and acquisition time. Typically, interpolation methods are used either to combine 2-D motion extracted from sparse slice acquisitions into 3-D motion or to construct a dense volume from sparse acquisitions before image registration methods are applied. This paper proposes a new phase-based 3-D motion estimation technique that first computes harmonic phase volumes from interpolated tagged slices and then matches them using an image registration framework. The approach uses several concepts from diffeomorphic image registration with a key novelty that defines a symmetric similarity metric on harmonic phase volumes from multiple orientations. The material property of harmonic phase solves the aperture problem of optical flow and intensity-based methods and is robust to tag fading. A harmonic magnitude volume is used in enforcing incompressibility in the tissue regions. The estimated motion fields are dense, incompressible, diffeomorphic, and inverse-consistent at a 3-D voxel level. The method was evaluated using simulated phantoms, human brain data in mild head accelerations, human tongue data during speech, and an open cardiac data set. The method shows comparable accuracy to three existing methods while demonstrating low computation time and robustness to tag fading and noise.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2723021","NIH/NIDCD; NIH/NINDS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7967856","Motion;3D;tagged MRI;phase;registration;incompressible","Three-dimensional displays;Interpolation;Harmonic analysis;Motion estimation;Tongue;Two dimensional displays;Tracking","biomechanics;biomedical MRI;brain;feature extraction;image denoising;image registration;image sequences;interpolation;medical image processing;motion estimation;phantoms;speech","incompressibility;tissue regions;estimated motion fields;inverse-consistent 3D voxel level;simulated phantoms;human brain data;mild head accelerations;human tongue data;speech;open cardiac data set;computation time;image denoising;harmonic magnitude volume;tag fading;intensity-based methods;optical flow;aperture problem;material property;multiple orientations;symmetric similarity metric;diffeomorphic image registration;image registration framework;interpolated tagged slices;harmonic phase volumes;phase-based 3D motion estimation;image registration methods;dense volume construction;sparse slice acquisitions;2D motion extraction;interpolation methods;acquisition time;image slice density;3D motion estimates;deforming tissue;tagged magnetic resonance images;phase vector incompressible registration algorithm","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Movement;Phantoms, Imaging;Speech;Tongue","2","","87","Traditional","4 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hybrid parallel imaging reconstruction methods by combining these two techniques have been developed for providing further acceleration. However, the widely used L1-norm of wavelet coefficients and total variation (TV) regularizer in traditional hybrid imaging methods limited further improvement in image quality. To further enhance imaging quality and reduce acquisition time, we proposed a regularized parallel imaging reconstruction method by incorporating sparsity-promoting wavelet prior and total generalized variation (TGV) regularizer. Specifically, the wavelet sparsity is effectively promoted through the L0 quasinorm of wavelet coefficients and tree-structured wavelet representation. This sparsity-promoting wavelet prior is capable of representing a better measure of sparseness to guarantee high-quality reconstruction even for high degrees of undersampling. Unlike TV regularizer, which preserves sharp edges but suffers from staircaselike artifacts, TGV regularizer can balance the tradeoff between edges preservation and artifacts suppression. Numerous experiments have been conducted on both simulated and in vivo MRI data sets to compare our proposed method with some state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

SoS images can be reconstructed from time-of-flight measurements from ultrasound images acquired using conventional handheld ultrasound transducers. Variational networks (VNs) have recently been shown to be a potential learning-based approach for optimizing inverse problems in image reconstruction. Despite earlier promising results, these methods, however, do not generalize well from simulated to acquired data, due to the domain shift. In this work, we present for the first time a VN solution for a pulse-echo SoS image reconstruction problem using diverging waves with conventional transducers and single-sided tissue access. This is made possible by incorporating simulations with varying complexity into training. We use loop unrolling of gradient descent with momentum, with an exponentially weighted loss of outputs at each unrolled iteration in order to regularize the training. We learn norms as activation functions regularized to have smooth forms for robustness to input distribution variations. We evaluate reconstruction quality on the ray-based and full-wave simulations as well as on the tissue-mimicking phantom data, in comparison with a classical iterative [limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS)] optimization of this image reconstruction problem. We show that the proposed regularization techniques combined with multisource domain training yield substantial improvements in the domain adaptation capabilities of VN, reducing the median root mean squared error (RMSE) by 54% on a wave-based simulation data set compared to the baseline VN. We also show that on data acquired from a tissue-mimicking breast phantom, the proposed VN provides improved reconstruction in 12 ms.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3010186","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144249","Image reconstruction;neural networks;ultrasonography","Image reconstruction;Training;Adaptation models;Optimization;Imaging;Transducers;Robustness","biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;gradient methods;image reconstruction;inverse problems;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;phantoms;tumours","unrolled iteration;full-wave simulations;tissue-mimicking phantom data;multisource domain training yield substantial improvements;wave-based simulation data;tissue-mimicking breast phantom;training variational networks;multidomain simulations;speed-of-sound image reconstruction;breast cancer imaging;malignant tumors;SoS images;time-of-flight measurements;ultrasound images;potential learning-based approach;inverse problems;VN solution;pulse-echo SoS image reconstruction problem;diverging waves;single-sided tissue access;handheld ultrasound transducers","","1","","51","IEEE","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that these variables accurately account for the psychophysical properties of the tactile sense. Based on this, a psychophysical fuzzy rule-based model of vibrotactile perception is introduced to forecast the comfort values of the vibrational signals provided by an automobile haptic screen. Using an efficient rule-based generation method, a Mamdani fuzzy inference system is proposed; it achieves a mean error rate of 14% for the train set and 17% for the test set, while correctly classifying most of the signals within a reasonable tolerance, related to human evaluation imprecision.

Noise characterization is particularly important in the presence of parallel imaging acceleration with multi-coil acquisitions, where the noise distribution can contain severe spatial heterogeneities. If the parallel imaging reconstruction is a linear process, an accurate noise analysis can be carried out by taking into account the correlations between all the samples involved. However, for k-space-based techniques such as generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA), the exact analysis has been considered computationally-prohibitive due to the very large size of the noise covariance matrices required to characterize the noise propagation from k-space to image space. Previously proposed methods avoid this computational burden by formulating the GRAPPA reconstruction as a pixel-wise linear operation performed in the image space. However, these methods are not exact in the presence of non-uniform sampling of k-space (e.g., containing a calibration region). For this reason, in this paper, we develop an accurate characterization of the noise distribution for self-calibrated parallel imaging in the presence of arbitrary Cartesian sampling patterns. By exploiting the symmetries and separability in the noise propagation process, the proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require large matrices. Under the assumption of a fixed reconstruction kernel, this method provides the precise distribution of the noise variance for each coil's image. These coil-by-coil noise maps are subsequently combined according to the coil combination approach used in image reconstruction, and therefore can be applied with both complex coil combination and root-sum-of-squares-approaches. In this paper, we present the proposed noise characterization method and compare it to previous techniques using Monte Carlo simulations as well as phantom acquisitions.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2760921","MICIN; Junta de Castilla y León; MINECO through FPI; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063348","Magnetic resonance imaging;noise estimation;non-stationarity noise;GRAPPA;parallel imaging;g-factor","Image reconstruction;Covariance matrices;Kernel;Estimation;Convolution","biomedical MRI;calibration;coils;covariance matrices;image reconstruction;image sampling;medical image processing","exact calculation;k-space analysis;noise distribution;magnetic resonance images;quality assurance;protocol optimization;parallel imaging acceleration;multicoil acquisitions;parallel imaging reconstruction;generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition;noise covariance matrices;image space;GRAPPA reconstruction;pixel-wise linear operation;noise propagation process;coil-by-coil noise maps;image reconstruction;noise characterization method;g-factor;nonuniform sampling;self-calibrated parallel imaging;Cartesian sampling patterns;fixed reconstruction kernel;root-sum-of-squares-approach","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Software","","","27","","9 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Knowledge about the interactions between the applied magnetic fields and peripheral nerves allows the optimizer to identify coil solutions that minimize PNS while satisfying the traditional engineering constraints. We compare the simulated thresholds of PNS-optimized body and head gradients to conventional designs, and find an up to 2-fold reduction in PNS propensity with moderate penalties in coil inductance and field linearity, potentially doubling the image encoding performance that can be safely used in humans. The same framework may be useful in designing and operating magneto- and electro-stimulation devices.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.3023329","National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194994","Gradient coil design;MRI safety;peripheral nerve stimulation;electromagnetic field simulation;magneto-stimulation thresholds;neurodynamic nerve model","Coils;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optimization;Windings;Current density;Torque","bioelectric potentials;biomedical MRI;coils;image coding;neurophysiology;optimisation","MRI gradient coils;magnetic resonance imaging data;PNS characteristics;coil design phase;constructed coil prototypes;PNS effects;coil optimization process;applied magnetic fields;peripheral nerves;coil solutions;traditional engineering constraints;PNS-optimized body;head gradients;PNS propensity;coil inductance;field linearity;image encoding performance;electro-stimulation devices;explicit peripheral nerve stimulation constraints","","","","64","IEEE","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technology greatly simplifies the process of acquiring and presenting panoramic and immersive still images, and offers for the first time a practical technology for true panoramic and panospheric full motion video. PI has become feasible because of a number of separate advances, including the development of appropriate optics, the emergence of a general digital image remapping capability able to correct even severely distorted images, and the availability of wide angle virtual reality (VR) headsets with head orientation sensing, which provide an appropriate device for viewing such images.","","0-7803-2559-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1995.538258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=538258","","Optical distortion;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing;Optical devices;Virtual reality;Digital images;Head;Humans;HDTV","image processing;virtual reality","panospheric imaging;fully immersive spherical perspective image;full motion video;optics;digital image remapping capability;wide-angle virtual reality headsets","","8","13","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proliferation of digital acquisition equipment has enabled even small institutions to produce considerable amounts of studies. Furthermore, the general trend for new imaging modalities is to produce more data per examinations. As a result, the design and implementation of tomorrow's storage and communication systems must deal with Big Data issues. Moreover, new realities such as the outsourcing of medical imaging infrastructures to the Cloud impose additional pressure on these systems. The research on technologies for coping with Big Data issues on large scale medical imaging environments is still in its early stages. This is mostly due to the difficulty of implementing and validating new technological approaches in real environments, without interfering with clinical practice. Therefore, it is crucial to create test bed environments for research purposes. This article proposes a methodology for creating simulated Big Data repositories. The system is able to use a real world repository to collect data from a representative time window and expand it according to research needs. In addition, the solution provides anonymization tools and allows exporting two types of simulated data: a structured file repository containing DICOM objects and a statistical summary of the archive content based on its characteristics, such as the number of produced studies per day, their modality and their associated data volumes.","","978-9-8998-4346-2","10.1109/CISTI.2016.7521382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521382","medical imaging;pacs;dicom;big data;repositories","DICOM;Picture archiving and communication systems;Metadata;Big data;Standards;Medical diagnostic imaging","Big Data;biomedical imaging;data acquisition;data structures;digital simulation;medical information systems;visual databases","medical imaging research;digital acquisition equipment;medical imaging infrastructures;simulated big data repositories;representative time window;structured file repository;DICOM objects;data volumes","","1","","22","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Divergence-free wavelets have the advantage of enforcing soft divergence-free conditions when discretization and partial voluming result in numerical non-divergence-free components and at the same time, provide sparse representation of flow in a generally divergence-free field. Efficient denoising is achieved by appropriate shrinkage of divergence-free and non-divergence-free wavelet coefficients.

In contrast to previous work, we propose a new approach based on the use of learned overcomplete dictionaries that allow for much sparser representations of the signals since they are optimized for a particular class of images such as US images. In this study, the dictionary was learned using the K-SVD algorithm and CS reconstruction was performed on the non-log envelope data by removing 20% to 80% of the original data. Using numerically simulated images, we evaluate the influence of the training parameters and of the sampling strategy. The latter is done by comparing the two most common sampling patterns, i.e., point-wise and line-wise random patterns. The results show in particular that line-wise sampling yields an accuracy comparable to the conventional point-wise sampling. This indicates that CS acquisition of 3D data is feasible in a relatively simple setting, and thus offers the perspective of increasing the frame rate by skipping the acquisition of RF lines. Next, we evaluated this approach on US volumes of several ex vivo and in vivo organs. We first show that the learned dictionary approach yields better performances than conventional fixed transforms such as Fourier or discrete cosine. Finally, we investigate the generality of the learned dictionary approach and show that it is possible to build a general dictionary allowing to reliably reconstruct different volumes of different ex vivo or in vivo organs.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2015.2442154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118193","Compressed sensing;3D ultrasound;overcomplete dictionaries;K-SVD;sparse representation","Dictionaries;Image reconstruction;Three-dimensional displays;Radio frequency;Imaging;Ultrasonic imaging;Sensors","biological organs;biomedical ultrasonics;compressed sensing;data acquisition;image reconstruction;image representation;image sampling;medical image processing;singular value decomposition","compressed sensing reconstruction;3D ultrasound data;dictionary learning;line-wise subsampling;3D ultrasound imaging;sparser representation;K-SVD algorithm;nonlog envelope data;compressed sensing acquisition;frame rate;ex vivo organs;in vivo organs","Algorithms;Animals;Brain;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Echocardiography;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Kidney;Machine Learning;Sheep;Swine;Ultrasonography","47","","39","","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the parallel image reconstruction algorithms in many medical MRI scanners are based on the GRAPPA model, this study aims to quantify the statistical implications that the GRAPPA model has in functional connectivity studies. The linear mathematical framework derived in the work of Rowe , 2007, is adapted to represent the complex-valued GRAPPA image reconstruction operation in terms of a real-valued isomorphism, and a statistical analysis is performed on the effects that the GRAPPA operation has on reconstructed voxel means and correlations. The interpolation of missing spatial frequencies with the GRAPPA model is shown to result in an artificial correlation induced between voxels in the reconstructed images, and these artificial correlations are shown to reside in the low temporal frequency spectrum commonly associated with functional connectivity. Through a real-valued isomorphism, such as the one outlined in this manuscript, the exact artificial correlations induced by the GRAPPA model are not simply estimated, as they would be with simulations, but are precisely quantified. If these correlations are unaccounted for, they can incur an increase in false positives in functional connectivity studies.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2288521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656901","Connectivity analysis;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);image reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);parallel imaging;quantification and estimation","Correlation;Image reconstruction;Coils;Vectors;Kernel;Interpolation;Time series analysis","biomedical MRI;calibration;frequency measurement;image reconstruction;interpolation;isomorphism;medical image processing;statistical analysis","statistical impact quantification;fcMRI data;real-valued isomorphism;missing spatial frequencies interpolation;generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions parallel magnetic resonance imaging;reconstructed frequency measurements;acquired frequency measurements;parallel image reconstruction algorithms;medical MRI scanners;functional connectivity studies;linear mathematical framework;complex-valued GRAPPA image reconstruction operation;statistical analysis;reconstructed voxel means;artificial correlation;low temporal frequency spectrum","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging","6","","44","","6 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a trade-off between resolution and data acquisition time is introduced. For microbubble (MB) localization, centroid detection is commonly used. Therefore, low-concentrations of MBs are required to avoid overlapping point spread functions (PSFs), leading to a long data acquisition time due to the limited number of detectable MBs in an image frame. Recently, deep learning-based MB localization methods across high-concentration regimes have been proposed to shorten the data acquisition time. In this work, a data-driven encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (deep-ULM) and a model-based deep unfolded network embedding a sparsity prior (deep unfolded ULM) are analyzed in terms of localization accuracy and computational complexity. The results of simulated test data showed that both deep learning methods could handle overlapping PSFs better than centroid detection. Additionally, thanks to its model-based approach, deep unfolded ULM needed much fewer learning parameters and was computationally more efficient, and consequently achieved better generalizability than deep-ULM. It is expected that deep unfolded ULM will be more robust in-vivo.","1948-5727","978-1-7281-5448-0","10.1109/IUS46767.2020.9251561","NVIDIA Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251561","deep unfolded network;high-concentration microbubble localization;model-based neural network;super-resolution ultrasound imaging;ultrasound localization microscopy","Deep learning;Ultrasonic imaging;Image resolution;Microscopy;Computational modeling;Data acquisition;Neural networks","biomedical ultrasonics;convolution;data acquisition;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;optical transfer function;ultrasonic imaging","fast ultrasound localization microscopy;resolution limit;conventional ultrasound imaging;trade-off between resolution;microbubble localization;centroid detection;overlapping point spread functions;long data acquisition time;detectable MBs;image frame;deep learning-based;localization methods;high-concentration regimes;data-driven encoder-decoder convolutional neural network;deep-ULM;model-based deep unfolded network;deep unfolded ULM;localization accuracy;simulated test data;deep learning methods;model-based approach;fewer learning parameters","","","","26","","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because of cardiac motion and the limited data acquisition speed of existing MRI techniques, it has been very difficult to acquire dynamic images of very high spatiotemporal resolution. This paper proposes a new generalized series (GS) based imaging technique to overcome this challenging problem. Specifically, the proposed technique collects two data sets: a) a sequence of high-resolution reference images over several cardiac cycles using a gated cine acquisition scheme before the injection of a contrast agent (or a molecular probe), and b) a sequence of reduced data sets with very high frame rate during the transient wash-in/wash-out stage of the contrast agent. A GS model is then used to combine these two data sets to reconstruct a high-resolution image sequence, capturing both the cardiac motions and dynamic signal changes due to the interaction of the contrast agent with the cardiac tissues. The proposed technique has been validated using both simulated and experimental data, which show that high-resolution dynamic images can be acquired with as few as 8 encodings (in contrast to 256 encodings required in the traditional Fourier transform-based methods).

In our system, the parameters for the impedance control scheme are used as the targets for adjustment. After mass amount of training, the worker is supposed to be able to execute deburring tasks successfully. This is because the worker might have gotten some knowledge about tuning the parameters required in the impedance control scheme. Thus, the rules for adjusting the parameters in impedance control are the operational skills to be identified. In this research, a training scheme, called the evolution-based virtual training scheme, is proposed in extracting knowledge for robotic deburring tasks. In this approach, an evolution strategy is employed for searching for the best set of fuzzy rules. This learning scheme has been successfully applied in adjusting the parameters of impedance controllers required in deburring operations.

Although many systems have been proposed that correlate alarms, the more fundamental question still remains of what to correlate and how to recognise it.

Estimations of plans are in our work, made at different decision-levels, both company-level and the subsumed platoon-level. Naturally, successful plan recognition is heavily dependent on the data that is supplied, and, hence, sensor management is a necessity. A key feature of the sensor management discussed here is that it is driven by the information need of the plan recognition process. In our research, we have presented a general framework for connecting information need to sensor management. In our framework implementation, an essential part is the prioritization of sensing tasks, which is necessary to efficiently utilize limited sensing resources. In our first implementation, the priorities were calculated from, for instance, the estimated threats of opponents (as a function of plan estimates), the distance to the opponent, and the uncertainty in its position. In this article, we add a particle filter method to more carefully represent the uncertainty in the opponent state estimate to make prioritization more well founded and, ultimately, to achieve robust plan recognition. By using the particle filter, we can obtain more reliable state estimate (through the particle filter's ability to represent complex probability distributions) and also a statistically based threat variation (through Monte-Carlo simulation). The state transition model of the particle filter can also be used to predict future states to direct sensors with a time delay (a common property of large-scale sensing systems), such as sensors mounted on UAVs that have to travel some distance to make a measurement.","","0-7803-9286-8","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1591853","","Information filtering;Information filters;Robustness;Particle filters;Probability distribution;Uncertainty;State estimation;Sensor systems;Joining processes;Predictive models","probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;knowledge representation;decision making;filtering theory;multi-agent systems;knowledge acquisition","particle filter-based information acquisition;plan recognition process;probability distribution;plausible plan;decision-level estimation;company-level estimation;subsumed platoon-level estimation;sensor management;uncertainty representation;opponent state estimation;state transition model","","7","","14","","13 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional full-scan methods acquire each of these images independently, resulting in a tradeoff between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. To address this problem, a generalized series-based reduced-encoding method has been proposed, which collects one or a few high-resolution references and a sequence of reduced data sets. This paper extends this imaging scheme to allow deformable references to be used to compensate for possible geometric variations between the references and the reduced data sets. The deformable references are constructed using a thin-plate spline model and a mutual information-based registration algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can handle large geometric changes such as those encountered in cardiac imaging.","","0-7803-7584-X","10.1109/ISBI.2002.1029376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1029376","","High-resolution imaging;Spatial resolution;Encoding;Image reconstruction;Image coding;Spline;Application software;Image resolution;Deformable models;Solid modeling","image coding;image resolution;splines (mathematics);image registration;time series;medical image processing;cardiology;biomedical MRI","cardiac imaging;large geometric changes;possible geometric variations;deformable references;generalized series dynamic imaging;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;thin-plate spline model;reduced data sets sequence;generalized series-based reduced-encoding method","","1","","17","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sci., Sungshin Women's Univ., Seoul, South Korea; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","6 Aug 2002","1997","9","5","813","825","We examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. Mining association rules means that, given a database of sales transactions, to discover all associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of other items in the same transaction. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items that appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first, and then, identifying, within this candidate set, these itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally, this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k, where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate sets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we develop an effective algorithm for the candidate set generation. It is a hash-based algorithm and is especially effective for the generation of a candidate set for large 2-itemsets. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. The advantage of the proposed algorithm also provides us the opportunity of reducing the amount of disk I/O required. An extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.634757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=634757","","Data mining;Association rules;Itemsets;Marketing and sales;Transaction databases;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Performance analysis;Mining industry;Credit cards","knowledge acquisition;deductive databases;very large databases;file organisation;transaction processing;sales management;marketing data processing;marketing;software performance evaluation;database theory","hash-based method;transaction trimming;association rule mining;large database;sales transactions;item association;large itemsets;data mining performance;candidate set generation;performance bottleneck;transaction database size;computational cost;disk input-output;simulation study","","181","1","17","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is no solution to the crosstalk caused by Tc-99m and I-123 photopeak overlap and by downscatter of I-123 photons into the Tc-99m spectral window and accurate quantification cannot be achieved. We describe a generalized spectral factor analysis (GSFA) method for solving crosstalk and downscatter problems in simultaneous Tc-99m/I-123 SPECT to improve quantitative accuracy. In GSFA, the spectrum of the photons detected in each pixel is expressed as a linear combination of two photopeaks and K-2 scattered spectra common to all pixels. These basis spectra are estimated using a PCA of all spectra from which a Q-dimensional study space 3 is derived. The basis spectra are then identified in 3 using priors. Conventional SFA assumes that the number K of basis spectra is equal to the dimension Q of 3. We generalized SFA to estimate K factors in a Q-dimensional space, Q>K. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a Tc-99m/I-123 brain phantom, we show that unlike SFA or conventional spectral windows (WIN), GSFA yields accurate quantitative measurements both from the I-123 images (errors <5% against errors between -13% and +14% with SFA and WIN) and from the Tc-99m images with a maximum error less than 4.5%, against errors between 28% and 49% with SFA and WIN.","1082-3654","0-7803-6503-8","10.1109/NSSMIC.2000.949218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949218","","Brain;Image analysis;Spectral analysis;Single photon emission computed tomography;Isotopes;Electromagnetic scattering;Particle scattering;Biomedical imaging;Diseases;Image sequence analysis","single photon emission computed tomography;brain;medical image processing;image registration;principal component analysis;spectral analysis;crosstalk;image sequences;Monte Carlo methods","SPECT brain imaging;simultaneous Tc-99m/I-l23 acquisition;generalized spectral factor analysis;radiotracer distribution;brain diseases;crosstalk;photopeak overlap;quantitative accuracy;PCA;Q-dimensional space;Monte Carlo simulation;medical image sequences","","","","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order for CS-based imaging schemes to be effective, the signal of interest should be sparse or compressible in a known representation, and the measurement scheme should have good mathematical properties with respect to this representation. While MR images are often compressible, the second requirement is often only weakly satisfied with respect to commonly used Fourier encoding schemes. This paper investigates the use of random encoding for CS-MRI, in an effort to emulate the “universal” encoding schemes suggested by the theoretical CS literature. This random encoding is achieved experimentally with tailored spatially-selective radio-frequency (RF) pulses. Both simulation and experimental studies were conducted to investigate the imaging properties of this new scheme with respect to Fourier schemes. Results indicate that random encoding has the potential to outperform conventional encoding in certain scenarios. However, our study also indicates that random encoding fails to satisfy theoretical sufficient conditions for stable and accurate CS reconstruction in many scenarios of interest. Therefore, there is still no general theoretical performance guarantee for CS-MRI, with or without random encoding, and CS-based methods should be developed and validated carefully in the context of specific applications.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2085084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599301","Compressed sensing;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);radio-frequency encoding","Encoding;Image reconstruction;Image coding;Radio frequency;Noise;Imaging;Data acquisition","biomedical MRI;data acquisition","compressed-sensing MRI;random encoding;magnetic resonance data acquisition time;mathematical properties;Fourier encoding scheme;measurement scheme;universal encoding scheme;spatially-selective radio-frequency pulse;imaging properties","Algorithms;Brain;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Monte Carlo Method;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","121","5","57","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel eclectic approach to rule extraction from NNs, named LOcal Rule Extraction (LORE), suited for multilayer perceptron networks with discrete (logical or categorical) inputs. The extracted rules mimic network behavior on the training set and relax this condition on the remaining input space. First, a multilayer perceptron network is trained under standard regime. It is then transformed into an equivalent form, returning the same numerical result as the original network, yet being able to produce rules generalizing the network output for cases similar to a given input. The partial rules extracted for every training set sample are then merged to form a decision diagram (DD) from which logic rules can be extracted. A rule format explicitly separating subsets of inputs for which an answer is known from those with an undetermined answer is presented. A special data structure, the decision diagram, allowing efficient partial rule merging is introduced. With regard to rules' complexity and generalization abilities, LORE gives results comparable to those reported previously. An algorithm transforming DDs into interpretable boolean expressions is described. Experimental running times of rule extraction are proportional to the network's training time.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2106163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715888","Decision diagrams;feedforward neural networks;logic rules;rule extraction;true false unknown logic","Training;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Data structures;Classification algorithms;Merging","Boolean functions;computational complexity;decision diagrams;knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;multilayer perceptrons","local rule extraction;neural networks;decision diagrams;knowledge acquisition;multilayer perceptron networks;discrete inputs;network behavior;training set;data structure;LORE;complexity ability;generalization ability;Boolean expressions","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics","24","","22","","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, computational models come with problems and risks. It is difficult to (automatically) extract essential information about the developing internal representations from a set of simulation runs, and often researchers limit themselves to analysing learning curves based on empirical recognition accuracy through time. The associated risk is to erroneously deem a specific learning behaviour as generalisable to human learners, while it could also be a mere consequence (artifact) of the implementation of the artificial learner or of the input coding scheme. In this paper a set of simulation runs taken from the ACORNS project is investigated.

In contrast to model-driven methods, which test for a particular BOLD signal whose shape must be given beforehand, data-driven methods generate a set of BOLD signals directly from the fMRI data by clustering voxels into groups with correlated time signals. Here, we address the problem of selecting only the clusters that represent genuine responses to the experimental stimulus by modeling the correlation structure of the clustered data using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model is empirically justified by demonstrating the hierarchical organization of the voxel correlations after cluster analysis. BOLD signal discrimination is demonstrated using: 1) simulations that contain multiple pathological BOLD response signals; and 2) fMRI data acquired during an event-related motor task. These demonstrations are compared with results from a model-driven method based on the general linear model. Our simulations show that the data-driven method can discriminate between the BOLD response signals, while the model-driven method only finds one signal. For fMRI, the data-driven method distinguishes between the BOLD signals appearing in the sensorimotor cortex and those in basal ganglia and putamen, while the model-driven method combines these signals into one activation map. We conclude that the proposed data-driven method provides an objective framework to identify and discriminate between distinct BOLD response signals.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2108296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5704191","Bayesian hierarchical model;cerebrovascular disease (CVD);cluster analysis;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);stroke","Correlation;Data models;Bayesian methods;Joints;Analytical models;Brain modeling;Computational modeling","Bayes methods;biochemistry;bioelectric potentials;biomedical MRI;blood;blood vessels;brain;data acquisition;diseases;medical image processing;medical signal detection;neurophysiology;oxygen","Bayesian hierarchical correlation model;fMRI cluster analysis;blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging;BOLD fMRI signal discrimination;cerebrovascular disease;data-driven method;clustering voxel correlations;data acquisition;event-related motor task;general linear mode;sensorimotor cortex;basal ganglia;putamen","Adult;Bayes Theorem;Brain;Brain;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cluster Analysis;Female;Hemodynamics;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Theoretical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","3","","49","","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, virtual environment applications such as man-machine seamless interaction require the system to estimate accurate motion parameters at real-time for natural objects such as human bodies. To achieve this requirement, we have been developing a vision-based motion capture system which reconstructs time-varying motion parameters of 3D multi-part objects. The advantage of such a vision-based system is that it is possible to acquire the other scene parameters such as shape and surface properties at the same time, using the same equipment in measuring motion. In this paper, as our first system, we have implemented a color-marker-based motion capture system which realizes multi-view fusion and have demonstrated our motion capture and reconstruction system works at real-time on PC-clusters.","","0-7695-0040-4","10.1109/ICIAP.1999.797662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=797662","","Real time systems;Cameras;Virtual environment;Shape measurement;Man machine systems;Motion estimation;Parameter estimation;Humans;Time varying systems;Layout","computer vision;real-time systems;motion estimation;video signal processing;virtual reality;user interfaces;image reconstruction;sensor fusion;parameter estimation;time-varying systems","real-time motion capture system;multiple camera fusion;3D multi-part objects;seamless mapping;virtual environments;man-machine seamless interaction;motion parameters;human bodies;vision;reconstruction;time-varying motion parameters;color-marker-based motion capture system;multi-view fusion","","28","1","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Motion artifact suppression in MRI using k-Space overlap processing","Y. M. Kadah","Biomedical Engineering Department, Cairo University, Egypt","2008 National Radio Science Conference","13 Jun 2008","2008","","","1","9","Starting from the general assumption of rigid body motion, we consider the case when the acquisition of the k-space is in the form of bands of finite number of lines arranged in a rectilinear fashion to cover the k-space area of interest. We consider cases with an averaging factor of at least 2. Instead of acquiring a full k-space of each image and then average the result, we develop a new acquisition strategy based on acquiring the k-space in consecutive overlapped bands. In case of no motion, this overlap can be used as the second acquisition. On the other hand, when motion is encountered, such overlap can be used to substantially reduce motion artifacts in the resultant image. This is achieved by utilizing the overlap area to estimate the motion, which is then taken into consideration in image reconstruction. We demonstrate the success of this approach using both numerical simulations as well as real data acquired from a human volunteer. The new method has the potential for practical applications to make more efficient use of MRI scanners and making the scan time lower allowing for more comfort to the patient.","","978-977-5031-95-2","10.1109/NRSC.2008.4542321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4542321","Motion artifact;magnetic resonance imaging;artifact suppression;navigator echo","Magnetic resonance imaging;Biomedical imaging;Biomedical engineering;Medical diagnostic imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Motion estimation;Image reconstruction;Numerical simulation;Humans;Navigation","biomedical equipment;biomedical MRI;image reconstruction;image scanners;medical image processing;motion estimation","motion artifact suppression;MRI scanners;k-space overlap processing;rigid body motion;motion estimation;image reconstruction;human volunteer;data acquisition;MRI scanners and;patient comfort;numerical simulations;scan time","","1","3","25","","13 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The general model underlying the simulator assumes that the image capture device contains multiple classes of sensors with different spectral sensitivities and that each sensor responds in a known way to irradiance over most of its operating range. The input to the simulator is a set of narrow-band images of the scene taken with a custom-designed hyperspectral camera system. The parameters for the simulator are the number of sensor classes, the sensor spectral sensitivities, the noise statistics and number of quantization levels for each sensor class, the spatial arrangement of the sensors and the exposure duration. The output of the simulator is the raw image data that would have been acquired by the simulated image capture device. To test the simulator, we acquired images of the same scene both with the hyperspectral camera and with a calibrated Kodak DCS-200 digital color camera. We used the simulator to predict the DCS-200 output from the hyperspectral data. The agreement between simulated and acquired images validated the image capture response model and our simulator implementation. We believe the simulator will provide a useful tool for understanding the effect of varying the design parameters of an image capture device.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.902295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902295","","Hyperspectral sensors;Image sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Layout;Digital cameras;Narrowband;Noise level;Statistics;Quantization;Testing","image processing;spectral analysis;cameras;digital simulation;CCD image sensors;noise;statistical analysis","spectral sensitivity;sensor responses simulation;hyperspectral images;performance;image capture simulator;narrow-band images;custom-designed hyperspectral camera system;noise statistics;quantization levels;exposure duration;image data;Kodak DCS-200 digital color camera;image capture response model;design parameters;image capture device;CCD","","44","","13","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ideally, the information should be presented in a manner that provides real-time situational awareness and increases task efficiency and operational autonomy. Typically, however, the effective display of information has been limited by the relatively low resolution of radiation-tolerant sunlight readable displays and the low processing power available on currently deployed spacesuits. As part of NASA's Enabling Technology Development and Demonstrations Program, a prototype EVA Information System has been constructed to test and study human-computer interaction and system operations. In one tested configuration, the Information System provides acquisition and display of science data via a cuff-mounted graphical display and keypad and features a camera capable of capturing both still images and high-definition video. The Information System provides a capability for astronaut-computer interaction beyond currently deployed state-of-the art EVA systems. Using the Information System, crewmembers may receive timeline-based procedures, general procedures, and text messages from either ground or space-based EVA mission controllers. Additionally, using the EVA Information System prototype, crewmembers can generate and analyze scientific artifacts (pictures, videos, or voice notes) and deliver them to the ground-based science team for detailed analysis. This paper discusses the software architecture of the prototype Information System software and the user feedback obtained from field testing the system at NASA's Desert Research and Technologies Studies (Desert RATS) activity.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187352","","Global Positioning System;Cameras;Rats;Information systems;Prototypes;NASA;Testing","aerospace computing;cameras;computer graphics;data acquisition;high definition video;human computer interaction;information systems;software architecture;video signal processing","astronaut-computer interaction analysis;human space exploration;spacesuit operation;real-time situational awareness;task efficiency;operational autonomy;radiation-tolerant sunlight readable display;NASA;EVA information system;human-computer interaction;system operation;data acquisition;data display;science data;cuff-mounted graphical display;keypad;camera;still image;high-definition video;timeline-based procedure;text message;space-based EVA mission controller;ground-based science team;software architecture;user feedback;Desert Research and Technologies Studies;Desert RATS activity","","1","","13","","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the quality of calibration when the number of auto-calibration signal (ACS) lines is restricted, we propose a sparsity-promoting regularized calibration method that finds a GRAPPA kernel consistent with the ACS fit equations that yields jointly sparse reconstructed coil channel images. Several experiments evaluate the performance of the proposed method relative to unregularized and existing regularized calibration methods for both low-quality and underdetermined fits from the ACS lines. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, like other regularization methods, is capable of mitigating noise amplification, and in addition, the proposed method is particularly effective at minimizing coherent aliasing artifacts caused by poor kernel calibration in real data. Using the proposed method, we can increase the total achievable acceleration while reducing degradation of the reconstructed image better than existing regularized calibration methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2256923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495720","Compressed sensing;image reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging;parallel imaging","Image reconstruction;Kernel;Calibration;Coils;Imaging;Noise;Acceleration","biomedical MRI;calibration;compressed sensing;image reconstruction;medical image processing","parallel MRI reconstruction;image quality;generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions;calibration quality;autocalibration signal lines;GRAPPA kernel calibration;ACS fit equations;coil channel images;regularized calibration methods;noise amplification;magnetic resonance imaging","Algorithms;Brain;Calibration;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuroimaging;Phantoms, Imaging","20","","30","","9 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We analyzed the learning performance of the three different models, highlighting the behavioral differences among them. We proved that the model with a distributed plasticity produces a faster and more accurate cerebellar response, especially during a second session of acquisition, compared with the single plasticity model. Furthermore, the pathological model shows an impaired learning capability in Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex acquisition, as found in neurophysiological studies.

In the current work, it is demonstrated that this assumption is not held for DCEUS. A better-adapted maximum likelihood criterion based on a multiplicative model is proposed. It is tested on simulated bolus perfusion data and on 11 sequences acquired in vivo during bolus perfusion of contrast agent in the cortex of healthy murine kidney, an area where the perfusion is expected to be approximately homogeneous. Results on simulated data show a significant improvement (p <; 0.05) of the precision and the accuracy for the estimations of perfusion parameters time to peak (TTP), wash-in rate (WiR), and mean transit time (MTT).

This study proposes a system which may aid them in overcoming this obstacle. The HaptiGuide is an affordable system which employs a standard desktop computer and a commercially available off-the-shelf haptic joystick. The HaptiGuide enables the construction of simple two dimensional haptic-aural virtual environments. Navigating by the haptic joystick, the user may virtually explore a new environment prior to encountering it in the physical world. This study describes a feasibility study, where nine children who are congenitally blind, were introduced to a novel environment via the HaptiGuide. After traversing the virtual environment, the participants were asked to perform various wayfinding tasks in the equivalent physical environment. In addition, there was a control condition where the participants were introduced to a similar but different novel environment via a direct experience approach. In this condition the participants were personally guided in the physical environment, and then asked to perform wayfinding tasks within the environment. The results indicate that the participants indeed generalized the knowledge acquired during the virtual exploration, and successfully applied it to the physical environment. Preliminary data analysis suggests that performance speed was not diminished compared to that of the control condition.

One of the difficulties is due to the general loss of performance that is frequently observed when implementing data processing algorithms on such systems and running the devices in new environments. Performance values are traditionally estimated theoretically or numerically (personal computer simulations) or are evaluated on real data but in a simulated environment. While the best performance measurements are accredited due to experiments driven in a real environment, the data at stake in this case are not entirely controlled. We propose in this paper the new concept of a virtual patient for real-time ECG analyzers. This concept enables a real environment to be created virtually by generating signals from a database composed of real acquired data. The analog signals generated will be seen by the analyzer as if they were coming from instantaneous electrical heart activities. This procedure provides a more correct assessment of the ECG analyzer performance than was previously possible. The test bench is useful for Holter manufacturers since it can deliver genuine performance values of the device.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2010.2064610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5570996","Biomedical equipment;electrocardiography;real-time systems;signal generators;systems engineering;test equipment","Electrocardiography;Databases;Real time systems;Monitoring;Digital signal processing;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture","biomedical equipment;data acquisition;electrocardiography;medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;virtual reality","virtual patient;real-time ECG analyzer;real-time system;electrocardiogram analyzer;data processing algorithm;analog signals;electrical heart activity;Holter manufacturers","","8","","15","","13 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the method uses a continuous representation of objects in the image domain instead of a discretized representation. Simulations and experiments show the possibilities of the method in both radial and spiral imaging. Simulations revealed that minimum-norm least-squares image reconstruction can result in a drastic decrease of artifacts compared with regridding-based reconstruction. Besides, both in vivo and phantom experiments showed that minimum-norm least-squares image reconstruction leads to contrast improvement and increased signal-to-noise ratio compared with image reconstruction based on regridding.

Intra-node transactions are performed within a node using only a local network, and inter-node transactions work with more than one nodes using both intra- and inter-node networks. It is very trivial that it takes inter-node transactions a longer time to finish their job than intra-node transactions. It consequently means that transactions for synchronization, such as acquire or release transaction, generally need a long time to be performed because synchronization variables are mostly shared by caches. From this point of view, we have proposed a new synchronization method called Freeze and Melt.

To manipulate some object with regrasping motion, there are many parameters to be determined; the grasping points, grasping forces, regrasping phases, finger allocation and so on. It is difficult to optimize such manipulation parameters for achieving effective manipulation. We propose a generation method of regrasping motion for a four-fingered robot hand using evolutionary programming (EP). In this case, EP determines not only finger motions, but also rotation of the target object in order to increase its manipulability. In manipulating an object like a rectangular solid, it is very important to change the object directions and to grasp another face according to the task progress because the grasping faces tend to be limited to only two. The evolutionary optimization method is generally able to find optimal solutions without a supervisor after much iteration, which makes it almost impractical to apply a real robot directly. Therefore we control the real robot hand with an optimal controller that has been generated in computer simulations.

In the simulation of 3 × 3 grid world with an invisible goal task, by introducing a recurrent neural network for Q-learning, an agent can represent more accurate Q-values considering the past experiences, and that is suggested to enable to learn appropriate actions.

A precise estimation is essential for a better understanding of cerebral activations. The most recent works have used a nonparametric framework for this estimation, considering each brain region as a system characterized by its impulse response, the so-called hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, the use of these techniques has remained limited since they are not well-adapted to real fMRI data. Here, we develop a threefold extension to previous works. We consider asynchronous event-related paradigms account for different trial types and integrate several fMRI sessions into the estimation. These generalizations are simultaneously addressed through a badly conditioned observation model. Bayesian formalism is used to model temporal prior information of the underlying physiological process of the brain hemodynamic response. By this way, the HRF estimate results from a tradeoff between information brought by the data and by our prior knowledge. This tradeoff is modeled with hyperparameters that are set to the maximum-likelihood estimate using an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. The proposed unsupervised approach is validated on both synthetic and real fMRI data, the latter originating from a speech perception experiment.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.817759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233922","","Robustness;Hemodynamics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Spatial resolution;Data acquisition;Protocols;Blood;Bayesian methods;Brain modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation","biomedical MRI;haemodynamics;maximum likelihood estimation;brain models;Bayes methods;time series","unsupervised robust nonparametric estimation;hemodynamic response function;fMRI experiment;blood oxygen level-dependent response;functional magnetic resonance imaging;cerebral activations;nonparametric framework;brain region;impulse response;threefold extension;asynchronous event-related paradigms;badly conditioned observation model;Bayesian formalism;temporal prior information;physiological process;hyperparameters;maximum-likelihood estimate;expectation conditional maximization algorithm;unsupervised approach;synthetic fMRI data;real fMRI data;speech perception experiment","Algorithms;Brain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Computer Simulation;Hemodynamics;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Likelihood Functions;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Speech Perception","91","","37","","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MCNPX package was used to generate the distributions of positron emitters in a uniform cylinder PMMA phantom irradiated by a collimated 180 MeV pristine proton beam. Two PET systems, a small dual-panel rotational PET and a stationary brain PET, with depth-of-interaction (DOI) measurement, were simulated with GATE for imaging. The images were reconstructed with list-mode MLEM algorithm using simulated coincidence data accumulated during- and post-irradiations. Positron activity-ranges were measured as a function of number of beam spills, total acquisition time, crystal cross-section size, crystal length, and the number of coincidence events. Results show that the accuracy of activity-range measurement is a function of data statistics but converging rapidly within few beam spills under simulated conditions; few spills can be sufficient to measure the activity-range within 1.0 mm from the final converged value; the number of spills can be further reduced if acquiring 30-60 sec post-irradiation data, which is still considered a rapid intra-treatment imaging. The accuracy and precision of activity-range measurement was also calculated as a function of count statistics under the simulated conditions, providing a general and very useful guideline to calculate the required statistics for an accurate intra-treatment “in-beam” activity-range measurement.","1082-3654","978-1-4799-0534-8","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829312","","Crystals;Protons;Positron emission tomography;Accuracy;Particle beams;Positrons","brain;collimators;image reconstruction;medical image processing;Monte Carlo methods;phantoms;positron emission tomography;radiation therapy","Monte Carlo simulation;in-beam intratreatment PET imaging;proton beam-range verification;rapid feedback;treatment planning;intratreatment image-guided adaptive proton therapy;MCNPX package;positron emitter distributions;uniform cylinder PMMA phantom irradiation;collimated pristine proton beam;intratreatment in-beam activity-range measurement;rapid intratreatment imaging;data statistics;crystal length;crystal cross-section size;list-mode MLEM algorithm;image reconstruction;GATE;DOI measurement;depth-of-interaction measurement;stationary brain PET;dual-panel rotational PET","","","","4","","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Modified Generalized Series Approach: Application to Sparsely Sampled fMRI","H. M. Nguyen; G. H.

In addition, a shorter readout length allows for a shorter minimum TE, which is important for optimizing SNR. This can be achieved by undersampling the k-space. However, the conventional Fourier transform-based reconstruction method suffers from under-sampling artifacts such as high-frequency ringing and loss of resolution. To address this problem, we revisit the constrained-model approach using the generalized-series (GS) which has been proposed to address the undersampling problem for dynamic MRI. We propose a modification to the conventional use of the model in order to reflect small hemodynamic signal changes typical in fMRI. Specifically, while realizing that having high model order is necessary to capture missing information, we found that it is not necessary to span all frequencies of GS basis functions uniformly. Instead, having k-space and GS “sampling” trajectories covering low-frequencies uniformly while spanning high-frequencies sparsely, was observed to be an efficient strategy. The ability of the method over the conventional GS approach in improving resolution of functional images and activation maps while reducing undersampling ringing is demonstrated by simulations and experiments at 3T. Reduction in the readout time allowed an increase of statistical signal power as compared to the fully sampled acquisition. Unlike compressed sensing approaches, the proposed method is linear and hence has lower computational complexity. The method could prove useful for other imaging modalities where the signal change is smaller than the baseline component.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2013.2265699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522893","Constrained reconstruction;functional MRI;generalized series (GS);undersampling","Correlation;Image reconstruction;Trajectory;Imaging;Spatial resolution;Spirals","biomedical MRI;haemodynamics;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sampling;medical image processing;statistical analysis;time series","generalized series approach;fMRI sparse sampling;functional MRI;susceptibility artifact;SNR optimization;k-space trajectory;Fourier transform-based reconstruction method;undersampling artifact;constrained-model approach;hemodynamic signal change;GS sampling trajectory;image resolution;functional image;activation map;statistical signal power;compressed sensing approach;computational complexity;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic flux density 3 T","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Evoked Potentials;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Sample Size;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Visual Perception","15","","32","","3 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It uses the distinction between signals, symbols, and words for the analysis of evolutionary models of language. In particular, it shows how evolutionary computation techniques such as artificial life can be used to study the emergence of syntax and symbols from simple communication signals. Initially, a computational model that evolves repertoires of isolated signal is presented. This study has simulated the emergence of signals for naming foods in a population of foragers. This type of model studies communication systems based on simple signal-object associations. Subsequently, models that study the emergence of grounded symbols are discussed in general, including a detailed description of a work on the evolution of simple syntactic rules. This model focuses on the emergence of symbol-symbol relationships in evolved languages. Finally, computational models of syntax acquisition and evolution are discussed. These different types of computational models provide an operational definition of the signal/symbol/word distinction. The simulation and analysis of these types of models will help to understand the role of symbols and symbol acquisition in the origin of language.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.918429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918429","","Computational modeling;Retina;Horses;Humans;Animals;Signal analysis;Evolutionary computation;Analytical models;Neural networks;Grounding","artificial life;evolutionary computation;digital simulation;linguistics","communication evolution;language evolution;words;evolutionary computation techniques;artificial life;syntax;foragers;signal-object associations;grounded symbols;symbol-symbol relationships;syntax acquisition;symbol acquisition","","60","1","27","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system in its current configuration is designed to enable distance training of students in real scenarios of robot manipulator programming. From a technological perspective, the research work presented in this paper is directed towards the adaptation of concepts and techniques developed in the field of telerobotics and virtual reality, and their integration in such e-laboratory settings. This paper focuses particularly on the educational impact of such systems. The goal is to assess the performance of e-laboratory scenarios in terms of the efficacy of training provided to students. The results of a pilot experimental study are presented, providing a comparative evaluation for three training modalities: real, remote, and virtual training on robot manipulator programming. The experiments were conducted according to an evaluation protocol specially designed for the considered target training task, using scoring charts to obtain quantitative performance measures and assess the performance of the student groups participating in the course. Training, as a dynamic process, is approached according to a classical three dimensional model, and performance scores are accordingly assessed in these dimensions (namely: low-level versus mid and high-level skills and understanding). The obtained results reveal certain differences between the three groups, particularly as related to the low-level skill training score, giving some insight about the training `dimensions' that are expected to be mostly affected by the absence of physical (or realistic virtual) presence in a real hands-on experimentation. Statistical analysis indicates, however, that, despite these apparent differences, such e-laboratory modules can be integrated quite effectively in practical scenarios, creating virtual training environments that can provide adequate learning elements, as related particularly to mid and high-level skill acquisition. Further work and large-scale studies are still needed, though, in order to explore the extent to which such a general conclusion is valid in different training settings, and to form the basis of a more theoretical evaluation for a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical differences between real, virtual, and remote learning/training methodologies and experiences","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2006.879255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668280","Distance training;evaluation methodology;remote laboratory;telerobotics;virtual robotic laboratory","Manipulators;Telerobotics;Virtual reality;Control engineering education;Statistics;Student experiments","computer based training;control engineering education;distance learning;educational courses;manipulators;statistical analysis;student experiments;telerobotics;virtual reality","virtual robotic laboratory;remote robotic laboratory;e-laboratory;distance training;robot manipulator programming;telerobotics;virtual reality;scoring charts;statistical analysis;virtual training environments;high-level skill acquisition","","103","","24","","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

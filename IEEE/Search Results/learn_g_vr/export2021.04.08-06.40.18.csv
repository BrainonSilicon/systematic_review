In this paper, we develop a socially aware distributed caching strategy based on a decentralized learning automaton, referred to as the Discrete Generalized Pursuit Algorithm (DGPA), to optimize the cache placement operation in D2D networks. Different from existing caching schemes, the proposed algorithm not only considers the file request probability and the closeness of devices as measured by their distance, but also takes into account the social relationship between D2D users. Furthermore, we characterize the mutual impact between the contents cached in different D2D users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges quickly and outperforms its counterparts using deterministic caching and random caching. Our work sheds new insights on the optimal design of D2D cache placement operations.","","978-1-5090-2482-7","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7849047","","Device-to-device communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Estimation;Bandwidth;Pursuit algorithms;Cellular networks;Throughput","automata theory;cache storage;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;telecommunication computing","socially aware distributed caching;device-to-device communication networks;next generation mobile networks;discrete generalized pursuit algorithm;DGPA;D2D networks;file request probability;decentralized learning automaton","","7","","13","","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The on-line adaptive learning algorithm for the controller guarantees the high robustness of the proposed controller. The principle of operation, stability, robustness, and the special features of the control scheme are discussed. The major advantage of the proposed scheme is its simplicity of implementation. Also, only the output voltage and the load current are required to be sensed.

Interested in how different levels of equilibrioceptive feedback influence the usability of this interface, a formal user study was conducted comparing the two modes in both separated and combined pitch and yaw travel tasks. Six of 30 subjects dropped out of the experiment because of cyber-sickness and were interviewed by the experimenter. Statistical analysis of data from the remaining subjects showed that although objectively there was no significant difference between the two modes regarding training effects and task performance, subjectively most subjects preferred the elastic tilt mode because of its intuitiveness, realism, fun, and sense of presence despite the greater fatigue and after effects (e.g., loss of balance) of using it.

Highly dynamic and stochastic nature of IoT mobile machines suggests applying machine learning methodology to effectively enhance the proactive network association. In this paper, an online proactive network association is proposed for this distributed computing and networking scenario, in order to minimize the average task delay subject to time-average energy consumption. We first formulate an event-triggered delay model for mobility-aware anticipatory network association mechanism that takes future possible handovers into account. Based on the Markov decision processes (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization, a two-stage online decision algorithm for proactive network association is innovated for individual mobile machine without the statistical knowledge of random events that may lack of enough prior data. Theoretical analysis proves that the delay performance of proposed algorithm attains asymptotic optimality within the bounded deviation. Furthermore, an asynchronous online distributed association decision algorithm based on the nonlinear problem transformation is proposed to support more general scenarios of multi-machine event-triggered associations.

A general view is also provided that they are the special cases of either the linear model or the single control system. On the other hand, since the immune network system possesses a self organizing and distributed memory, it is thus adaptive to its external environment and allows a PDP (parallel distributed processing) network to complete patterns against the environmental situation.

Its feasibility is analyzed using maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion and its robustness to uncertain noise conditions is compared to that of the conventional maximum likelihood (ML)-based classifiers. To reduce the design and training cost of DNN classifiers, a simple but effective pre-processing method is introduced and adopted. Furthermore, featuring multiple recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, the DNN modulation classifier is realized. Simulation results show that the proposed RNN-based classifier is robust to the uncertain noise conditions, and the performance of it approaches to that of the ideal ML classifier with perfect channel and noise information. Moreover, with a much lower complexity, it outperforms the existing ML-based classifiers, specifically, expectation maximization (EM) and expectation conditional maximization (ECM) classifiers which iteratively estimate channel and noise parameters. In addition, the proposed classifier is shown to be invariant to the signal distortion such as frequency offset. Furthermore, the adopted pre-processing method is shown to accelerate the training process of our proposed classifier, thus reducing the training cost. Lastly, the computational complexity of our proposed classifier is analyzed and compared to other traditional ones, which further demonstrates its overall advantage.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2951594","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891763","Blind Modulation Classification;Cognitive Radio;Deep Neural Network","Modulation;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Training;Gaussian noise;Maximum likelihood estimation;Channel estimation","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;modulation;neural nets;noise;signal classification;SISO communication;telecommunication computing","RNN-based classifier;RNN layers;multiple recurrent neural network;ML-based classifiers;MAP criterion;DNN-based modulation classifiers;maximum likelihood classifiers;computational complexity;signal distortion invariant;channel iterative estimation;channel state information;noise information;pre-processing method;training cost reduction;maximum a posteriori probability criterion;SISO systems;single-input single-output systems;uncertain noise conditions;robust modulation classification;deep neural network","","14","","42","IEEE","5 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first case is that the delay is time-varying and large, and in this case, there is no restriction imposed on the delay and the control (and/or rest) width. The other one is that the delay is small enough so that it is less than the minimum of control width. Different approaches are provided to investigate these two cases, and some criteria are given to realize exponential synchronization. Furthermore, by applying the adaptive approach to the second model, we establish a general adaptive theory for intermittent control, which can be applied not only to networks without time delay, but also to delayed networks, regardless of whether the intermittent control is periodic or aperiodic.

In the context of CRN, two types of users may coexist: primary users (PU) , i.e. licensed user and the secondary user (SU), i.e. opportunistic user who is willing to transmit over the licensed bandwidth of PU. The main aim of a SU is to maximize his transmission rate. Hence, he must target the best channels, i.e. the must available one with the best performance. To estimate the availability of channels, one can use the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) learning algorithms such as (Thompson Sampling, Upper Confidence Bound, and e-greedy, etc.). Generally, these algorithms are proposed to handle the simple case of a single SU. MAB algorithms are composed of two stages: exploration and exploitation. In this study, we consider the multi-user case where a novel policy is proposed to manage the CRN network. In our study, we consider the case where the SUs have different ranks and transmission priorities. To evaluate our policy, we use the parameter regret which is the reward loss between the maximum reward getting from the best channel and the actual reward got from selecting sub-optimal channels (i.e. less vacant ones). Our simulations show that the proposed policy achieves better results than some known policies such as Random Rank or SL(K) (Selective learning of the k-th largest expected rewards) policies.","","978-1-7281-1929-8","10.1109/EECS.2018.00116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8910022","Cognitive Radio;Learning Algorithms;Tactical Radio;Dynamic Spectrum Access;Opportunistic Spectrum Access;Decentralized network;Priority Access","Cognitive radio;Adaptation models;Dynamic spectrum access;Markov processes;Communication system security;Ad hoc networks","cognitive radio;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks;radio spectrum management;telecommunication computing","MAB algorithms;CRN network;transmission priorities;reward loss;sub-optimal channels;cognitive radio;tactical network;opportunistic spectrum access;OSA;multiarmed bandit learning algorithms;parameter regret","","2","","16","","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some distributed channel allocation schemes in the literature formulate the channel allocation problem as a potential game, in which the unilateral improvement dynamics is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium. In general, spatial adaptive play (SAP), which is one of the representative learning algorithms in the potential game-based approach, can reach an optimal Nash equilibrium stochastically. However, this is inefficient for the channel allocation and SAP tends to be stuck in a sub-optimal Nash equilibrium in a limited time. To assist in finding the optimal Nash equilibrium for this kind of channel allocation problem, we apply the REMCMC to the existing potential game-based channel allocation. We show that SAP can be considered as a sampling process of the Boltzmann- Gibbs distribution and sampling methods can be utilized. We evaluated the proposed algorithm through simulations and the results show that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal Nash equilibrium quickly.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-1217-6","10.1109/VTCSpring.2019.8746346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8746346","","Games;Nash equilibrium;Channel allocation;Markov processes;Sampling methods;Monte Carlo methods;Interference","channel allocation;cognitive radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;telecommunication computing","cognitive radio networks;replica exchange Monte Carlo method;REMCMC;general adaptive play;SAP;sub-optimal Nash equilibrium;spatial adaptive play;channel allocation schemes;game-based channel allocation;representative learning algorithms;Boltzmann-Gibbs sampling methods;Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution methods","","","","14","","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The control method is demonstrated for a linear time-invariant system with bounded parameter uncertainties, disturbances and noise. The presented scheme continuously collects measurements to reduce the uncertainty about the system parameters and adapts dynamic robust controllers online in a stable and performance-improving way. A key enabler for our approach is choosing a time-varying dynamic controller implementation, inspired by recent work on System Level Synthesis [1]. We leverage a new robustness result for this implementation to propose a general robust adaptive control algorithm. In particular, the algorithm allows us to impose communication and delay constraints on the controller implementation and is formulated as a sequence of robust optimization problems that can be solved in a distributed manner. The proposed control methodology performs particularly well when the interconnection between systems is sparse and the dynamics of local regions of subsystems depend only on a small number of parameters. As we will show on a five-dimensional exemplary chain-system, the algorithm can utilize system structure to efficiently learn and control the entire system while respecting communication and implementation constraints. Moreover, although current theoretical results require the assumption of small initial uncertainties to guarantee robustness, we will present simulations that show good closed-loop performance even in the case of large uncertainties, which suggests that this assumption is not critical for the presented technique and future work will focus on providing less conservative guarantees.","2378-5861","978-1-5386-7926-5","10.23919/ACC.2019.8814896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8814896","","Adaptive control;Uncertainty;Robustness;Control systems;Delays;Heuristic algorithms;Large-scale systems","adaptive control;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;distributed control;interconnected systems;learning systems;linear systems;robust control;uncertain systems","system parameters;stable performance-improving way;time-varying dynamic controller implementation;robustness result;general robust adaptive control algorithm;robust optimization problems;control methodology;five-dimensional exemplary chain-system;system structure;implementation constraints;scalable robust adaptive control;robust control;scalable learning;interconnected linear subsystems;control method;linear time-invariant system;bounded parameter uncertainties;system level synthesis;system level perspective;dynamic robust controllers","","2","","10","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, an important problem for PMSMs is that parasitic torques may degrade the performances of the drive system. These torque ripples generally vary periodically with the rotor position and lead to speed ripple. To suppress these speed ripples, an iterative learning control (ILC) is used, because it is a good candidate for dealing with periodical errors. In this paper, an original approach called “lying sensor technique” is proposed and analyzed. Compared to the torque ripple reduction approaches which realize the current compensation calculation in the controller, this technique consists in modifying the feedback speed information of the sensor. ILC is integrated into this technique for computing the lying speed information. Simulation is used to check the effectiveness of this approach.

In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving. We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments. We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset. Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.

A distributed adaptive control algorithm with an adaptive gain design based on the approximation capability of neural networks is proposed. We present a necessary and sufficient condition on the directed graph such that the containment error can be reduced as small as desired. As a byproduct, the leaderless consensus problem is solved with asymptotical convergence. Because relative velocity measurements between neighbors are generally more difficult to obtain than relative position measurements, we then propose a distributed containment control algorithm without using neighbors' velocity information. A two-step Lyapunov-based method is used to study the convergence of the closed-loop system. Next, we apply the ideas to deal with the containment control problem for networked unknown Lagrangian systems under a general directed graph.

Besides the technical challenges, there are safety, security, connectivity and scheduling concerns. The IEEE Education Society has formed a Working Group that is developing the Standard for Networked Smart Learning Objects for Online Laboratories (IEEE-SA P1876). Once the standard is adopted, there will be more opportunities to connect resources among universities, potentially producing distributed online laboratories. This paper looks at the design of a network of remote laboratories for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The LAC regions adds to the complexity of the proposed network because of its great diversity. Languages, educational systems, academic schedules, time zones are just some of the aspects in which the diversity is appreciable. This creates a challenging environment to develop collaborative strategies which generate benefits to all. The Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions (LACCEI) is participating in the IEEE P1876 Standard Working Group; with plans to develop a Remote Laboratories Network for the LAC region, collaborating under the Engineering for the Americas initiative and the OAS Ministers of Science and Technology's Working Group 2: Human Capacity Building and Education. This paper presents some existing networks in the region, and proposes a general design and architecture specification of administrative and technical aspects for the LACCEI network for remote laboratories.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757581","e-Learning Standards;Engineering for the Americas;STEM Education;Remote Laboratories;UML Models","Instruments;Internet;Computational modeling;Continents;Government;XML","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;Internet;laboratories","Latin American remote laboratories network;Caribbean remote laboratories network;laboratory experiments;physical laboratory;Internet;resources sharing;lab courses;IEEE Education Society;Standard for Networked Smart Learning Objects for Online Laboratories;IEEE-SA P1876;universities;distributed online laboratories;LAC regions;educational systems;academic schedules;collaborative strategies;Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions;LACCEI;IEEE P1876 standard working group;Engineering for the Americas initiative;OAS Ministers of Science and Technology","","4","","19","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing research has tended to conflate multiple constituent factors, resulting in an inability to appropriately determine which specific factors are the cause of observed variations in learning outcomes, and an inability to reliably interpret the external validity of the research outcomes.We begin with an outline of the supporting educational theories that underpin our understanding of laboratory education. We then identify notable examples in the literature where multiple variables, such as the user interface and access modes, have been conflated into laboratory `supertypes' and are not investigated independently. These supertypes reflect the most common variable combinations: `proximal laboratory, hands-on interface', `remote laboratory, rich contextual interface', and `simulated laboratory, decontextualized interface', referred to as hands-on, remote, and simulated/virtual respectively.We then investigate the impacts of this conflation - in the context of examples, this conflation limits the generalisability of previous results and obscures potentially rewarding avenues of future research. Finally, we present methods by which research may be conducted to investigate technically simpler directions of interface decoupling, the results of which may motivate the investigation of more challenging pairings.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658725","educational;laboratory;interface;remote;virtual;simulation;research;haptic;computer-mediated;rigor","Computational modeling;Education;Haptic interfaces;Remote laboratories;Data models;Analytical models;Feeds","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;laboratories;user interfaces","laboratory supertype conflation;laboratories;learning outcomes;laboratory education;user interface;access modes;proximal laboratory;remote laboratory;simulated laboratory;decontextualized interface;interface decoupling;educational theories;hands-on interface","","","","14","","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This will cause students to be focused on the material provided and tend to decrease conversation practice with someone directly. In addition, English learning time generally has a smaller portion and costly. Therefore, it needs to be developed a learning medium that is able to provide a way of learning English that simulates conversation directly. It can be accessed anywhere and anytime and minimize the cost of expenditure. Website-based learning can be an alternative.

In this paper, we focus on the adaptive demodulation technique in orbital angular momentum (OAM) free-space optical (FSO) communication system with the improved CNN. In order to achieve adaptive demodulation under free-space turbulence channel, the traditional CNN with our preliminary optimization methods has been firstly demonstrated. Then, in view of the relatively poor performance of traditional CNN for OAM modes demodulation under strong turbulence environment with long transmission distance, the network was deepened and the residual learning framework was used to solve the degradation problem. We have respectively investigated the performance of this improved CNN by testing the demodulation performance in 4-ary, 8-ary, 10-ary and 16-ary OAM systems, and analyzed the generalization ability of accommodating unknown turbulence environment by training the model with different training sets. The numerical simulation shows that the demodulation accuracy is about 100.0%, 99.5%, 99.2% and 99.0% respectively for 4-ary, 8-ary, 10-ary and 16-ary OAM systems over the 2000m free-space with strong turbulent level. And our improved CNN trained by a hybrid training set with several levels of turbulence can provide the model with stronger ability to accommodate more kinds of unknown turbulence environments.

To do so, we utilized the entropy distribution and the utility function to determine which positions have more uncertainties. Proposed strategy is divided into two phases: the learning phase and the action phase. In general, uncertainties increase unevenly and never disappear in dynamic environments. So in the learning phase, robots move wall to wall to learn which positions are likely to increase uncertainties actively. In the action phase, robots explore the environment efficiently and continue lifelong learning to handle environmental uncertainties. This strategy is an optimization not only for paths but also for sequences of exploration points using information about uncertainties of dynamic environments.

The popular method, Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) addresses the problem by iteratively updating a set of particles with a “sampling-weighting” loop. Sampling is decisive to the performance of MCL [1]. However, traditional MCL can only sample from a uniform distribution over the state space. Although variants of MCL propose different sampling models, they fail to provide an accurate distribution or generalize across scenes. To better deal with these problems, we present a distribution proposal model named Deep Samplable Observation Model (DSOM). DSOM takes a map and a 2D laser scan as inputs and outputs a conditional multimodal probability distribution of the pose, making the samples more focusing on the regions with higher likelihood. With such samples, the convergence is expected to be more effective and efficient. Considering that the learning-based sampling model may fail to capture the accurate pose sometimes, we furthermore propose the Adaptive Mixture MCL (AdaM MCL), which deploys a trusty mechanism to adaptively select updating mode for each particle to tolerate this situation. Equipped with DSOM, AdaM MCL can achieve more accurate estimation, faster convergence and better scalability than previous methods in both synthetic and real scenes. Even in real environments with long-term changes, AdaM MCL is able to localize the robot using DSOM trained only by simulation observations from a SLAM map or a blueprint map.

However, actual communication environments are marked by rapid and irregular changes, thus causing fluctuation of communication channel states. Hence, an empirically selected stationary network gives only limited prediction accuracy. In this article, we introduce regularization in updates of the CVNN weights to develop online dynamics that can self-optimize its effective network size in response to such channel-state changes. It realizes online adaptive, highly accurate and robust channel prediction with dynamical adjustment of the network size. We characterize its online adaptability in a series of simulations and our practical wireless-propagation experiments demonstrate that the proposed channel prediction scheme provides 2.5 dB and 5.5 dB improvement of bit error rate (BER) at 10-3 and $5\times 10^{-4}$ , and achieves 10-5 BER with $E_{b}/N_{0}=23-24$ dB.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3013940","JSPS KAKENHI; Cooperative Research Project Program of Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC), Tohoku University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9154677","Adaptive communications;channel prediction;channel state information (CSI);complex-valued neural network (CVNN);fading;5G wireless communications (5G-NR)","Fading channels;Mobile communication;Biological neural networks;Doppler effect;Predictive models","error statistics;fading channels;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;multipath channels;neural nets;optimisation;telecommunication computing","accurate channel prediction;robust channel prediction;online adaptability;channel prediction scheme;online regularization;structure optimization;wireless-communication channel prediction;fast-fading multipath mobile communications;fading communication channel;single complex-valued entity;high generalization ability;complex domain;communication environments;communication channel states;stationary network;prediction accuracy;online dynamics;effective network size;online-learning complex-valued neural networks;CVNNs;bit error rate;BER;wireless-propagation experiments;online adaptive channel prediction;noise figure 5.5 dB","","","","56","CCBY","3 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this signal model, the performance of the equivalent sensing matrix is analyzed by invoking restricted isometry property (RIP) in compressive sensing. In addition, the upper bound for $l_{1}$ -minimization based channel estimation method and tight channel estimation bound are derived in the framework of RIP and Oracle least square methodology, respectively.

Introducing semantics in virtual worlds helps define intelligent objects and interactions which would turn into a more realistic game. In this work, we propose to decouple the semantic definition of the game world from its actual implementation in a general-purpose game engine. A semantic layer has been developed to bridge the semantics formalized by ontologies with its realization in the engine. Thanks to this software library, semantics can be specified in a separate formal module and reused in different projects.

We compared our immersive environment to a desktop-based implementation in a user study with 20 participants across 7 tasks of varying difficulty, which targeted different user interface features. To investigate how performance is affected in the presence of clutter, we explored two scenarios with different numbers of trajectories. While the quantitative performance was similar for the majority of tasks, large differences appear when we analyze the patterns of interaction and consider subjective metrics.

In general, the steering of robotic vehicles depends on the interactions between the vehicle and its supporting medium.

To learn a transferable policy that can generalize to varying and growing networks, we propose the use of so-called random edge graph neural networks (REGNNs).

Many real-time traffic light control (TLC) algorithms are based on graded thresholds, because precise information about the traffic congestion in the road network is hard to obtain in practice. For example, using thresholds L1 and L2 , we could mark the congestion level on a particular lane as “low,” “medium,” or “high” based on whether the queue length on the lane is below L1, between L1 and L2, or above L2 , respectively. However, the TLC algorithms that were proposed in the literature incorporate fixed values for the thresholds, which, in general, are not optimal for all traffic conditions. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on stochastic optimization to tune the thresholds that are associated with a TLC algorithm for optimal performance. We also propose the following three novel TLC algorithms: 1) a full-state Q-learning algorithm with state aggregation, 2) a Q-learning algorithm with function approximation that involves an enhanced feature selection scheme, and 3) a priority-based TLC scheme. All these algorithms are threshold based. Next, we combine the threshold-tuning algorithm with the three aforementioned algorithms. Such a combination results in several interesting consequences. For example, in the case of Q-learning with full-state representation, our threshold-tuning algorithm suggests an optimal way of clustering states to reduce the cardinality of the state space, and in the case of the Q-learning algorithm with function approximation, our (threshold-tuning) algorithm provides a novel feature adaptation scheme to obtain an “optimal” selection of features. Our tuning algorithm is an incremental-update online scheme with proven convergence to the optimal values of thresholds. Moreover, the additional computational effort that is required because of the integration of the tuning scheme in any of the graded-threshold-based TLC algorithms is minimal. Simulation results show a significant gain in performance when our threshold-tuning algorithm is used in conjunction with various TLC algorithms compared to the original TLC algorithms without tuning and with fixed thresholds.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2209904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247516","Deterministic perturbation sequences;intelligent transportation systems;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA);stochastic optimization;threshold tuning;traffic signal control","Approximation algorithms;Tuning;Algorithm design and analysis;Roads;Function approximation;Clustering algorithms;Junctions","adaptive control;automated highways;feature extraction;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);queueing theory;real-time systems;road traffic control;state-space methods;stochastic programming","threshold tuning;stochastic optimization;graded signal control;adaptive traffic lights control;intelligent transportation system;real-time traffic light control algorithms;real-time TLC algorithms;graded thresholds;traffic congestion;road network;congestion level;queue length;traffic conditions;optimal performance;full-state Q-learning algorithm;state aggregation;function approximation;feature selection scheme;priority-based TLC scheme;threshold-tuning algorithm;three aforementioned algorithms;full-state representation;clustering states;state space cardinality;feature adaptation scheme;optimal features selection;incremental-update online scheme;optimal thresholds values","","18","","37","","23 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the diffusion Gauss-Newton method offers many advantages for solving the non-linear least squares problem in wireless sensor network to estimate target position parameter, there are some key challenges when applying it to practice, including singularity of Gauss-Newton Hessian, selection to constant step sizes and steady state oscillation. These remaining issues lead to obvious performance degradation such as high computational cost, vulnerability to step size change and resulting instability on estimation.In this paper, to eliminate the singularity, we develop a diffusion Levenberg-Marquardt method such that the problem of constant step size is also addressed together. Then, to reach agreement on estimated vector, a consensus implementation is further proposed, thus eliminating the oscillation during steady state. Consequently, the proposed consensus-based diffusion Levenberg-Marquardt method provides a general solution for the non-linear least squares problems with an objective that takes the form of a sum of squared residual terms. By applying to collaborative localization and distributed optimization arise in large scale machine learning, simulation results confirm the effectiveness and wide applicability of proposed method in terms of convergence rate, accuracy and consistency of estimates.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3041491","Local Science and Technology Development Fund guided by Central Government; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; Collaborative Innovation Project of Integration of Moss, Digital Intelligence funded by the innovation fund of University Production, Learning, and Research of the Science and Technology Development Center of the Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274340","Gauss-Newton method;collaborative localization;Levenberg-Marquardt;wireless sensor networks;nonlinear least squares","Wireless sensor networks;Optimization;Collaboration;Steady-state;Newton method;Convergence;Simulation","approximation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;Newton method;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","distributed optimization;collaborative localization;consensus-based diffusion Levenberg-Marquardt method;estimated vector;resulting instability;size change;steady state oscillation;constant step size;Gauss-Newton Hessian;target position parameter;wireless sensor network;nonlinear least squares problem;diffusion Gauss-Newton method","","","","38","CCBY","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Human workers usually accumulate his experience after executing the same task repetitively. In the process of training, the worker must find ways of adjusting his/her execution. In our system, the parameters for the impedance control scheme are used as the targets for adjustment. After mass amount of training, the worker is supposed to be able to execute deburring tasks successfully. This is because the worker might have gotten some knowledge about tuning the parameters required in the impedance control scheme. Thus, the rules for adjusting the parameters in impedance control are the operational skills to be identified. In this research, a training scheme, called the evolution-based virtual training scheme, is proposed in extracting knowledge for robotic deburring tasks. In this approach, an evolution strategy is employed for searching for the best set of fuzzy rules.

Since surface vessel systems are modeled by second-order dynamic in strict feedback form, backstepping is an ideal technique for finishing the tracking task. In the backstepping control of surface vessel, the virtual and actual controls are designed to be the optimized solutions of corresponding subsystems, therefore the overall control is optimized. In general, optimization control is designed based on the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. However, solving the equation is very difficult or even impossible due to the inherent nonlinearity and complexity. In order to overcome the difficulty, the reinforcement learning (RL) strategy of actor-critic architecture is usually considered, of which the critic and actor are utilized for evaluating the control performance and executing the control behavior, respectively. By employing the actor-critic RL algorithm for both virtual and actual controls of the vessel, it is proven that the desired optimizing and tracking performances can be arrived.

Moreover, when they are trained online to adapt to plant variations, the over-tuned phenomenon usually occurs. To overcome the weakness of the BPNN, we propose a neural fuzzy inference network (NFIN) suitable for adaptive control of practical plant systems in general and for adaptive temperature control of a water bath system in particular. The NFIN is inherently a modified Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK)-type fuzzy rule based model possessing a neural network's learning ability. In contrast to the general adaptive neural fuzzy networks, where the rules should be decided in advance before parameter learning is performed, there are no rules initially in the NFIN. The rules in the NFIN are created and adapted as online learning proceeds via simultaneous structure and parameter identification. The NFIN has been applied to a practical water bath temperature control system. As compared to the BPNN under the same training procedure, the simulated results show that not only can the NFIN greatly reduce the training time and avoid the over-tuned phenomenon, but the NFIN also has perfect regulation ability. The performance of the NFIN is compared to that of the traditional PID controller and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) on the water bath temperature control system. The three control schemes are compared, with respect to set point regulation, ramp-point tracking, and the influence of unknown impulse noise and large parameter variation in the temperature control system. The proposed NFIN scheme has the best control performance.","1558-2442","","10.1109/5326.777078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=777078","","Temperature control;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy neural networks;Adaptive control;Control systems;Neural networks;Industrial training;Backpropagation;Multi-layer neural network;Electrical equipment industry","neurocontrollers;fuzzy neural nets;uncertainty handling;inference mechanisms;backpropagation;adaptive control;temperature control;water;fuzzy set theory","neural fuzzy inference network;multilayered backpropagation neural networks;adaptive control;training time;over-tuned phenomenon;BPNN;NFIN;practical plant systems;adaptive temperature control;modified Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy rule based model;learning ability;parameter learning;online learning;parameter identification;regulation ability;traditional PID controller;fuzzy logic controller;water bath temperature control system;control schemes;set point regulation;ramp-point tracking;unknown impulse noise;large parameter variation","","26","","22","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, vehicle localization can be achieved by the global positioning systems (GPSs). However, in some special scenarios, such as cloud cover, tunnels or some places where the GPS signals are weak, GPS cannot perform well. The continuous and accurate localization services cannot be guaranteed. In order to improve the accuracy of vehicle localization, an assistant vehicle localization method based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is proposed in this paper. The assistant vehicle localization system is composed of three base stations (BSs) equipped with a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) array. The locations of vehicles can be estimated if the positions of the three BSs and the DOAs of vehicles estimated by the BSs are known. However, the DOA estimated accuracy maybe degrade dramatically when the electromagnetic environment is complex. In the proposed method, a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based robust DOA estimation approach is first proposed to achieve the off-grid DOA estimation of the target vehicles under the condition of nonuniform noise, where the covariance matrix of nonuniform noise is estimated by a least squares (LSs) procedure, and a grid refinement procedure implemented by finding the roots of a polynomial is performed to refine the grid points to reduce the off-grid error. Then, according to the DOA estimation results, the target vehicle is cross-located once by each two BSs in the localization system. Finally, robust localization can be realized based on the results of three-time cross-location. Plenty of simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2905788","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; Program of Hainan Association for Science and Technology Plans to Youth Research and Development Innovation; Scientific Research Projects of University in Hainan Province; Major Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province; Hainan University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; KDDI Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668514","Base station (BS);direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;nonuniform noise;off-grid error;sparse Bayesian learning (SBL);vehicle localization","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Internet of Things;MIMO communication;Base stations;Global Positioning System;Bayes methods","array signal processing;Bayes methods;direction-of-arrival estimation;Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;MIMO communication;telecommunication computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","direction-of-arrival estimation;assistant vehicle localization system;BSs;multiple input multiple output array;sparse Bayesian learning-based robust DOA estimation approach;off-grid DOA estimation;target vehicle;nonuniform noise;robust localization;collaborative base stations;SBL-based robust DOA estimation;wireless communication;GPS signals;continuous localization services;assistant vehicle localization method;Global Positioning Systems;Internet of Things;Internet of Vehicles;wireless network;MIMO array;electromagnetic environment;nonuniform noise condition;least squares procedure;polynomial;grid refinement procedure;three-time cross-location","","77","","44","","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first is that in most existing commercial architectures, it is hard if not impossible to separate the digital logic layer from the microarchitecture layer. This is especially true in RISC architectures. Second, such examples take different approaches to the implementation of the microarchitecture layer to the extent that often it is cumbersome to find common concepts to teach students about, apart from overarching and very general concepts. To address these limitations, the fourth edition of Structured Computer Organization by A. S. Tanenbaum introduced an innovative and integrated approach for teaching the subject. This approach was developed from “scratch”. It consists of a hypothetical hardware that executes Java byte-code and it includes a simulator for this hardware. In this paper, we describe how we fully utilized this approach in our classes, exploiting it to go beyond straightforward applications. Our utilization includes a lab assignment that raises expectations from students from merely understanding the existing implementation to extending it in many different ways. Survey results strongly support the hypothesis that our approach was extremely beneficial to help students grasp microarchitecture concepts in addition to other side-effect gains.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125106","Microarchitecture Education;Computer Organization;Simulators;Simulation-Based Learning;Lab Assignments","","computer aided instruction;computer science education;Java;reduced instruction set computing;teaching","undergraduate level;RISC architectures;Structured Computer Organization;Tanenbaum approach;microarchitecture design teaching;Java byte-code","","","","8","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system is a five-layered network, which features coalescence between Takagi-Sugeno-kang fuzzy architecture and dissymmetrical Gaussian functions as membership functions. The partitioning made by the dissymmetrical Gaussian functions introduces the dissymmetry to the left and right widths of the input space to increase the flexibility of the design, thus resulting in a parsimonious fuzzy neural network with higher performance under online learning. We apply two criteria for rule generation, namely system error and ε-completeness, reflecting both the performance and sample coverage of an existing rule base. During the parameters estimation phase, we adjust the Gaussian centers according to the adjustment of the widths. Parameters in the premise and the consequents are adjusted online based on the ε-completeness of the fuzzy rules and Kalman Filter (KF) approach, respectively.

However, the neural network architectures adopted by existing works suffer from poor scalability and generalization, and lack of interpretability. A long-standing approach to improve scalability and generalization is to incorporate the structures of the target task into the neural network architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve large-scale radio resource management problems, supported by effective neural network architecture design and theoretical analysis. Specifically, we first demonstrate that radio resource management problems can be formulated as graph optimization problems that enjoy a universal permutation equivariance property. We then identify a family of neural networks, named message passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs). It is demonstrated that they not only satisfy the permutation equivariance property, but also can generalize to large-scale problems, while enjoying a high computational efficiency. For interpretablity and theoretical guarantees, we prove the equivalence between MPGNNs and a family of distributed optimization algorithms, which is then used to analyze the performance and generalization of MPGNN-based methods. Extensive simulations, with power control and beamforming as two examples, demonstrate that the proposed method, trained in an unsupervised manner with unlabeled samples, matches or even outperforms classic optimization-based algorithms without domain-specific knowledge. Remarkably, the proposed method is highly scalable and can solve the beamforming problem in an interference channel with 1000 transceiver pairs within 6 milliseconds on a single GPU.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.3036965","General Research Fund from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9252917","Radio resource management;wireless networks;graph neural networks;distributed algorithms;permutation equivariance","Wireless networks;Neural networks;Resource management;Optimization;Computer architecture;Array signal processing;Scalability","deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;message passing;optimisation;radio networks;radio spectrum management;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","graph neural networks;wireless networks;large-scale radio resource management problems;neural network architecture design;graph optimization problems;deep learning;universal permutation equivariance property;distributed optimization algorithms;power control;interference channel","","","","43","IEEE","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many approaches for raceline optimization assume the tire-road friction coefficient to be known. However, this neglects the fact that the ability of the system to realize such a race trajectory depends on complex interdependencies between the online trajectory planner, the control systems and the non-modelled uncertainties. In general, a high quality control system can approach the physical limit more reliable, as it applies less corrective actions. We present a model-free learning method to find the minimum achievable lap-time for a given controller using online adaption of a scale factor for the maximum longitudinal and lateral accelerations in the online trajectory planner. In contrast to existing concepts, our approach can be applied as an extension to already available planning and control algorithms instead of replacing them.

Unlike commonly studied canonical form nonlinear systems whose neural network approximation system models have explicit relative degree structures, which can directly be used to derive parameterized controllers for adaptation, noncanonical form nonlinear systems usually do not have explicit relative degrees, and thus their approximation system models are also in noncanonical forms. It is well-known that the adaptive control of noncanonical form nonlinear systems involves the parameterization of system dynamics. As demonstrated in this paper, it is also the case for noncanonical neural network approximation system models. Effective control of such systems is an open research problem, especially in the presence of uncertain parameters. This paper shows that it is necessary to reparameterize such neural network system models for adaptive control design, and that such reparameterization can be realized using a relative degree formulation, a concept yet to be studied for general neural network system models. This paper then derives the parameterized controllers that guarantee closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking for noncanonical form neural network system models. An illustrative example is presented with the simulation results to demonstrate the control design procedure, and to verify the effectiveness of such a new design method.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2461001","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation of China; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194822","Adaptive control;feedback linearization;neural network system models;noncanonical nonlinear systems;output tracking","Nonlinear systems;Neural networks;Adaptation models;Approximation methods;Adaptive systems;Control design","adaptive control;approximation theory;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;stability;uncertain systems","adaptive neural network based control;noncanonical nonlinear systems;parametric uncertainties;parameterized controllers;adaptation system;noncanonical form nonlinear systems;system dynamics parameterization;noncanonical neural network approximation system models;uncertain parameters;adaptive control design;relative degree formulation;general neural network system models;closed-loop stability;asymptotic output tracking;noncanonical form neural network system models;control design procedure","","26","","49","","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, this system will be powered using machine learning algorithms with the help of a publicly available repository of over five million games. This will make the user feel like he/she is playing against another human and not a machine. The existing chess systems use a variety of algorithms in order to choose its move. Most of these use tree traversals and the most common one is the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Min-max algorithm finds the best move, and alpha-beta pruning prevents it from going into branches of the game tree that cannot yield a better result than previously traversed branches. Since the tree generated in a chess game is very deep and have a lot nodes, these algorithms examine the depth only to a certain amount. Generally, these algorithms are accompanied by an opening repository which bolsters the algorithm's efficiency. Since these algorithms are too strong for a visually impaired individual, a new approach is suggested to choose the computer's move. A publicly available repository of over five million chess games played by humans will be used to train the machine, initially. When the user makes his/her move, it will be converted into text and given as input to both the Minimax and the k-NN algorithms. The moves given as output by both these algorithms are compared using an evaluation function. The move with a higher score is chosen. The game continues till a decisive result is obtained.","","978-1-5386-1887-5","10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8389758","Speech Recognition;Hidden Markov Model;Minimax model;Alpha-beta pruning;k-nearest neighbour","Games;Speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Training;Data analysis;Engines","computer games;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;speech recognition;trees (mathematics)","chess game;visually impaired individual;k-NN algorithms;speech recognition based chess system;visual chess simulators;voice commands;min-max algorithm;alpha-beta pruning;game tree;machine learning algorithms;tree traversals","","","","9","","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This scheme allows an online computation of a neural controller that cancels tracking error in accordance with an imposed reference model. The ways in which learning is performed are discussed and a canonical representation of the control scheme is presented.

A modern approach to music and musical education devoted to children and boys (and also adults) should be, first based on real experimentations and/or computer simulations concerning the physics of sound, both acoustic and psychoacoustic. Due to the wide availability of personal computers and Internet technological advances, it is possible to draw children's attention to fundamental steps of the scientific method to approach the phenomenological world. A possible didactic itinerary is proposed in order to allow young middle-school students (aged 11-12) to analyse main features of the fundamental laws of the physics of sound. The paper considers the scheme of a didactic unit within a general project, carried out by RISMA. This project, based on the methodology of ""learn and enjoy yourself"", is directed at children and boys of elementary and middle school levels and devoted to deepening the acoustic peculiarities of sounds in order to build a scientific basis for more careful and conscious listening to music. The itinerary is essentially constituted by six steps. The first step consists of perception of an acoustic phenomenon in the classroom, generated by means of laboratory physical devices or musical instruments. In the second, pupils are invited to describe the phenomenon using spontaneous adjectives and their own language (brainstorming). Then, in the third step the teacher, by using suitable musical software and a personal computer, proposes experiments reproducing the phenomenon. The students are also invited, in the fourth step, to exploit Internet resources, in order to find new Web sites containing relevant information on the assigned topic. In the fifth step, reproduction of the phenomenon using their own creativity and computers is proposed to the pupils. Finally, in the last step, the teacher invites students to illustrate the overall experience by elaborating a short written presentation.","","0-7695-1623-8","10.1109/WDM.2002.1176463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176463","","Computer science education;Physics education;Music;Microcomputers;Internet;Acoustic devices;Computer simulation;Psychology;Aging;Educational institutions","music;computer aided instruction;microcomputer applications;Internet;Web sites;musical acoustics;musical instruments","musical education;music;children;scientific approach;boys;adults;computer simulations;real experimentations;sound physics;acoustics;psychoacoustics;personal computers;Internet;didactic itinerary;middle school students;RISMA;elementary school students;laboratory physical devices;musical instruments;spontaneous adjectives;brainstorming;musical software;Web sites;creativity","","","","2","","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, reading is the well-known brain exercise which helps the brain to improve concentration, promotes empathy, and helps the brain to effectively construct links between neurons. If a person can often keep reading habits, reading is the best exercise to prevent loss of cognitive function in old age. With the advanced development of the Internet and the popularity of electron carriers, electronic books (e-books) have been as computer-aided tools to help students learn in the classroom teaching activities. Sensing and clouding storage technologies are used as tools to assist teachers in teaching students to understand the learning status and learning achievement. In general, reading mainly is divided into two phases, learning to read, and reading to learn. In order to understand the learning status of students, teachers observe the learning behavior of students and analyze their learning ability and skills to adjust the teaching strategies and teaching progresses for adaptive learning in classrooms. In order to help teachers effectively observe students' learning, this study proposed a cloudized e-book reading rate tracking system (CERRTS) with an e-book learning environment and the proposed system includes the sensing technology of touch screen and the cloudized technology of storage. In order to verify the function of the proposed system, the study used a camera to record the learning status of students and to compare the reading rate of the system records and the reading rate of the camera recording. The results show that there is not significantly different between the system and the video. Moreover, the proposed system provided a friendly computer-assisted tool that helps instructors understand the learning status of students.","2156-8073","978-1-4673-5222-2","10.1109/ICSensT.2013.6727674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727674","Readning process;Reading rate;E-books;Sensor technology","Electronic publishing;Educational institutions;Sensors;Psychology;Cameras;Fingers","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;electronic publishing;image sensors;object tracking;teaching","reading tracking function;e-book reading system;sensing technologies;cloudized storage technologies;student knowledge;student ability;brain exercise;neurons;reading habits;cognitive function;electron carriers;electronic books;computer-aided tools;classroom teaching activities;learning behavior;cloudized e-book reading rate tracking system;CERRTS;reading rate;camera recording;video;computer-assisted tool;touch screen","","1","","19","","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate how the originally defined representational concept for the perception of affordances - in terms of using either optical flow or heuristically determined 3D features of perceptual entities should be generalized to using arbitrary visual feature representations. In this context we demonstrate the learning of causal relationships between visual cues and predictable interactions, and emphasize on a novel framework for cueing and hypothesis verification of affordances that could play an important role in future robot control architectures. We argue that affordance based perception should enable systems to react to environment stimuli both more efficient and autonomous, and provide a potential to plan on the basis of responses to more complex perceptual configurations.

Moreover, in the proposed architecture, the action network in the GrADP is improved by using the fuzzy hyperbolic model, which combines the merits of the fuzzy model and the neural network model. Based on the back-propagation technique, the parameters in the membership functions and the fuzzy rules are all undergo training and online adapting.

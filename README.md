# Hello!

This is the repo for March 2021's Systematic Literature Review

## Get Started
The purpose of this repo is to use a version control approach for the newest iteration of the systematic review.


## File Organization

This is the `main folder` which contains info about the repo's contents and how to navigate it.
Within the `main folder` there is:
- this README
- a `paper_count` file (which will inform the final PRISMA diagram) which is the number of papers returned from each Database, and the number of papers included based on the various steps of exclusion/inclusion
- a folder for each of the Databases that are searched in this review
- a `Papers` folder which contains the citation information for the identified papers

Inside each Database's folder is:
- a README containing information about the search strategy, the specifics of the database, images of the search results, and the status (how far through it I am)
- a `Search Results` folder containing the raw csv (and backup excel) files downloaded from the databases
- a `Search Strategy` folder which contains information about how a specific search was executed (and what results it brought)
- a `Analysis` folder which contains the files used to assess, filter, and analyze the searches' results


### Notes:
IEEE specific
- the IEEE database allows searches to be constrained by topic.
- it was noted on 28/3/21 that constraining search 'action_t_vr' by topics missed paper [this key paper][20b28581]
- I have flagged this paper in EndNote locker to be added in during "manual search" stage of the systematic review.
- Due to the nature of how exclusion criteria is applied, papers can slip through.
- At this time there has been no justification for not using the inbuilt 'exclusion by topic' feature of IEEE.

"Using additive noise in back-propagation training","L. Holmstrom; P. Koistinen","Rolf Nevanlinna Inst., Helsinki Univ., Finland; Rolf Nevanlinna Inst., Helsinki Univ., Finland","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","6 Aug 2002","1992","3","1","24","38","The possibility of improving the generalization capability of a neural network by introducing additive noise to the training samples is discussed. The network considered is a feedforward layered neural network trained with the back-propagation algorithm. Back-propagation training is viewed as nonlinear least-squares regression and the additive noise is interpreted as generating a kernel estimate of the probability density that describes the training vector distribution. Two specific application types are considered: pattern classifier networks and estimation of a nonstochastic mapping from data corrupted by measurement errors. It is not proved that the introduction of additive noise to the training vectors always improves network generalization. However, the analysis suggests mathematically justified rules for choosing the characteristics of noise if additive noise is used in training. Results of mathematical statistics are used to establish various asymptotic consistency results for the proposed method. Numerical simulations support the applicability of the training method.<>","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.105415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=105415","","Additive noise;Kernel;Neural networks;Intelligent networks;Feedforward neural networks;Measurement errors;Statistics;Numerical simulation;Noise generators;Nonlinear distortion","learning systems;least squares approximations;neural nets","additive noise;back-propagation training;feedforward layered neural network;nonlinear least-squares regression;kernel estimate;probability density;pattern classifier networks;nonstochastic mapping;mathematical statistics;asymptotic consistency results","","226","7","39","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulation results indicate that the automated helicopter trainer is capable of performing the hover maneuvers. To verify the concept of the automated trainer, a simple one axis manual control cart-pole system was used. Two groups of four students each were used in the experiment with one being the experimental group which was trained with the automated trainer, and the other being the control group which was trained with no automated trainer.

Estimation of an accurate amount of bandwidth to support this traffic has been a challenging task using conventional algorithmic approaches. We show that radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) are capable of learning the non-linear multi-dimensional mapping between different video traffic patterns, quality of service (QoS) requirements and the required bandwidth to support each call. In addition, the RBFNN model adopts to new traffic scenarios and still produces accurate results. This approach bypass the modeling approach which requires detailed knowledge about the traffic statistical patterns. Our method employs ""on-line"" measurements of the traffic count process over a monitoring period. In order to simplify the design of the RBFNN, the input traffic is preprocessed through a lowpass filter in order to smooth all high frequency fluctuations. A large set of training data, representing different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, was used to ensure that the RBFNN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new data. The reported results prove that the neurocomputing approach is effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods, based upon mathematical or simulation analysis. This is primarily due to the fact that the unique learning and adaptive capabilities of NN enable them to extract and memorize rules from previous experience.","","0-7803-4249-6","10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=648770","","Bandwidth;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Bit rate;Radial basis function networks;Monitoring;Data preprocessing;Filters;Frequency","asynchronous transfer mode;telecommunication networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);adaptive systems;visual communication","bandwidth estimation;ATM networks;RBF neural network;variable bit rate;VBR video traffic;long term correlations;nonstationary behavior;radial basis function neural networks;nonlinear multi-dimensional mapping;video traffic patterns;quality of service;QoS requirements;RBFNN model;on-line measurements;traffic count process;input traffic;lowpass filter;training dat;HF fluctuations smoothing;neurocomputing approach;adaptive capabilities;rules","","","","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two model-based predictive control strategies have been studied: the generalized predictive controller (GPC) and nonlinear adaptive model predictive controller (NAMPC). The neural network training and validation data are obtained from the open-loop simulation of a validated first principles plant model. The identified neural network (NN) model is validated using the following three different validation algorithms: (1) one-step ahead cross-correlation; (2) Akaike's final prediction error (AFPE) estimate; and (3) 5-step ahead prediction simulations. The algorithm has been applied to the temperature control of a fluidized bed furnace reactor of the steam deactivation unit of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant used to evaluate catalyst performance. The validation results show that the RNN models the reactor to a high degree of accuracy.

We attempt to address these challenges by proposing a dialogue management architecture that has an abstracted view of the world but yet is able to focus on relevant parts of the ontology at runtime. Specifically, we train a sub-domain identifier neural network that learns which features are relevant to the current turn and the immediate future, thus filtering out irrelevant information from the ontology and consequently the belief space at each dialogue turn. We then train a policy network that needs: a) to adapt to the sub-domain identifier's output; and b) to learn what information will carry over from previous turns and when it needs to be updated. We evaluate our method on a large information-seeking ontology that contains latent sub-domains. Our results in simulation and a small human trial show that the sub-domain identifier is able to generalise to unseen domains and achieve performance on par with a multi-domain dialogue manager where each sub-domain is carefully defined (golden standard).","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461754","Spoken Dialogue Management;Multiple Domains;Dialogue Policy;Policy Network","Ontologies;Electronics packaging;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Face;Neural networks","human computer interaction;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;neural nets;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","trained policy models;sub-domain identifier neural network;abstracted view;dialogue management architecture;multidomain dialogue systems;scalable information-seeking multidomain dialogue;multidomain dialogue manager;unseen domains;latent sub-domains;information-seeking ontology;policy network;dialogue turn;irrelevant information","","","","17","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

RoMoCo '05.","12 Dec 2005","2005","","","355","360","In this paper electromagnetic servo valve controlled differential hydraulic cylinders are considered as paradigms of non-linear systems that have locally nonlinearizable nonlinearities. One of them is of hydrodynamic origin: the flow resistance of the system is proportional to the square root of certain pressure difference that has infinite derivative at zero. The other nonlinearity is caused by the discontinuous behavior of the friction and adhesion forces between the piston and the cylinder at zero piston velocity. Such a behavior is difficult to control by the traditional PID controllers. Furthermore, uncertainties and variation of the hydrodynamic parameters in general make it unrealistic to develop an accurate model for such systems. Brocker and Lemmen proposed two different control approaches for the differential hydraulic cylinders based on the disturbance rejection, and on the partial flatness principles, respectively. In each case it was necessary to measure the external disturbance force and its time-derivative as well as to know the exact model of the system. Later on Tar et al. proposed an alternative adaptive approach that does not require to measure the disturbance force and to know the exact parameters of the cylinder. This method rejected to use time-derivatives because of the presence of friction, and, as a consequence it resulted in a very hectic transient phase of learning. In this paper an alternative approach is presented that combines this approach with the use of calculated time-derivatives that are ""rejected"" by adoptively varying the order of the derivation applied. In this way the harsh initial transients can be evaded. The operation of the method is presented by simulations.","","83-7143-266-6","10.1109/ROMOCO.2005.201449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554428","","Adaptive control;Force measurement;Hydrodynamics;Friction;Pistons;Servomechanisms;Valves;Nonlinear control systems;Control nonlinearities;Control systems","hydraulic systems;adaptive control;nonlinear control systems;servomechanisms;valves;flow control;friction;adhesion;learning (artificial intelligence)","fractional order adaptive control;locally nonlinearizable nonlinearities;electromagnetic servo valve control;differential hydraulic cylinders;nonlinear systems;flow resistance;pressure;discontinuous behavior;friction force;adhesion force;zero piston velocity;disturbance rejection;partial flatness principle;external disturbance force;time-derivative;learning;transients","","2","","10","","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A neural network-based identification and control scheme is presented. A single artificial neural network is trained to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the motor. A control law is derived using the dynamics captured by the network, and employed to force the stator currents to follow prescribed trajectories. The proposed architecture adapts and generalizes its learning to a wide variety of loads and, in addition provides the necessary abstraction when measurements are contaminated with noise.

This paper describes the design and prototype implementation of a scheduling system for shared online laboratory resources, which can be employed to coordinate reservations of usage time for multiple geographically dispersed users. This scheduling system facilitates various priority levels for user requests, thus allowing different modes of usage, such as experimental demonstrations during a live class by an instructor and experiments carried out either individually by one user or collaboratively by multiple users. This software module can also be integrated into a more general resource management system, which enables the standardized description of and efficient search for online resources.

The majority of the existing studies focus on the design of received signal strength (RSS)-based localization methods. However, when in the face of complicated environments with severe fading, RSS-based localization methods achieve relatively inferior accuracy performance, compared with fingerprinting-based localization methods. Nevertheless, traditional fingerprinting-based localization methods are subject to the condition that the source transmit power is known, which cannot be directly used in passive localization cases where the sensing nodes do not have the prior information on the source. In addition, the received sensing data may contain errors and then affect the location precision due to various abnormal conditions, such as device failure and malicious cases. In this paper, we propose a novel robust relative fingerprinting-based passive localization algorithm via a data cleansing approach. First, we figure out the fingerprint correlations property and introduce a new relative fingerprint framework. The key idea is that by exploring the correlations between the source fingerprint and the reference fingerprint database, the correction factors can be achieved to apply the fingerprint idea into the passive localization case. Second, we formulate a generalized modeling of the abnormal data in localization problem and propose a data cleansing approach which utilizes the sparse property of the abnormal data. Based on this, the negative influence of abnormal data can be further eliminated. Third, considering the sparse property of the source position, we use the sparse Bayesian learning in the matching process for the purpose of achieving more precise estimated source position. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy performance in passive source localization in terms of eliminating the abnormal data impairment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817576","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; China Postdoctoral Science Funded Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320377","Passive localization;robust localization;fingerprint;correlation;data cleansing","Sensors;Databases;Robustness;Fingerprint recognition;Correlation;Data models;Estimation","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);radionavigation;telecommunication computing","sparse Bayesian learning;robust relative fingerprinting;precise estimated source position;sparse property;reference fingerprint database;source fingerprint;relative fingerprint framework;fingerprint correlations property;data cleansing approach;received sensing data;source transmit power;traditional fingerprinting-based localization methods;relatively inferior accuracy performance;RSS;received signal strength-based localization methods;passive source localization","","","","43","","20 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, considering that the theoretical coupling strength required for synchronization may be much larger than the needed value, we propose an adaptive strategy to adjust the coupling strength for achieving a suitable value. For the latter, we establish a criterion for synchronization using the designed pinning controllers. It is found that the coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks with state coupling under the given linear feedback pinning controllers can realize synchronization when the coupling strength is very large, which is contrary to the coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks with spatial diffusion coupling.

Using these data, we approximate global inverse kinematics mapping using the MVRN. After approximating the inverse kinematics mapping, we find collision-free joint trajectories like a human being for the given task and the environment. We also adopt an adaptive neural network control scheme for motion control with unknown dynamics. From the global viewpoint, the MVRN may be considered as the long-term memory for relatively unchanging information for the robot manipulator and an adaptive neural network controller can be thought of as the short-term memory for the time-varying information for the change of load and dynamic parameters of the plant.

The goals of the present learning control design for automotive engines include improved performance, reduced emissions, and maintained optimum performance under various operating conditions. Using the data obtained from a test vehicle, we first develop a neural network model of the engine. The neural network controller is then designed based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control. In the simulation studies, the initial controller is trained using the neural network engine model developed rather than the actual engine. We have developed and tested self-learning neural network controllers for both engine torque and exhaust air-fuel ratio control. The goal of the engine torque control is to track the commanded torque. The objective of the air-fuel ratio control is to regulate the engine air-fuel ratio at specified set points. For both control problems, good transient performance of the neural network controller has been observed. A distinct feature of the present technique is the controller's real-time adaptation capability which allows the neural network controller to be further refined and improved in real-time vehicle operation through continuous learning and adaptation.","2158-9860","0-7803-8635-3","10.1109/ISIC.2004.1387711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387711","","Neural networks;Adaptive systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Automotive engineering;Engines;Dynamic programming;Optimal control;Torque control;Vehicles","neurocontrollers;control system synthesis;adaptive control;automobiles;fuel systems;dynamic programming;torque control;learning systems","automotive fuel-injection systems;adaptive critic control;neural network modeling;action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming;approximate optimal control;learning control design;neural network controller;exhaust air-fuel ratio control;engine torque control","","11","","24","","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a new efficient DOA estimation approach based on the deep neural networks (DNN) is proposed, in which a nonlinear mapping that relates the outputs of the receiving antennas with its associated DOAs is learned by using the DNN-based network. The novel network architecture is divided into two phases, the detection phase and the DOA estimation phase. Additional detection network dramatically reduces the size of the training set and the process of the training data preparation is discussed in detail. After finishing the training phase, the corresponding DOAs can be identified based on current input data during testing phase. It has been shown that the proposed method can not only achieve reasonably high DOA estimation accuracy, but also reduce the computational complexity required by traditional superresolution DOA estimation methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotation invariance (ESPRIT).

This is the particular case of electronics where practical education is based on traditional independent instruments and CAL tools are use for simulation only. A new approach of CAL tools in electronics is the virtual instrumentation technique. Virtual instruments result from the combination of a general purpose computer with a generic data acquisition system in order to emulate several traditional measurement instruments. Virtual instruments are characterized by their versatility and low cost so they are very suitable for educational applications. Nevertheless, the operation rate of these instruments is limited by the general-purpose orientation of the hardware. In this work, the authors propose a new solution for the implementation of virtual instruments based on reconfigurable data acquisition systems. The whole system is characterized by its versatility because software and hardware modules change dynamically according to the application requirements.

A new output feedback neural structure that has two hidden layers is proposed to make the parameters adaptively adjust themselves and stabilize to their best values. A higher accuracy and stronger generalization ability can be also obtained by reducing the number of network weights and accelerating the network training speed owing to the strong fitting and presentation ability of two-layer activation functions. Furthermore, the designed feedback loops of the neural network play a significant role in possessing associative memory and rapid system convergence. This proposed double hidden layer output feedback neural based global sliding mode controller is simulated on the model of APF and the results show the excellent static and dynamic properties.

By the virtue of significant advancements on the API technique, an adaptive API methodology is eventually established in combination with SLFN-based adaptive approximators, and it contributes to a recursive mechanism for the AARC scheme. As a consequence, the output regulation error can asymptotically converge to the origin, and all other signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded.

Generally, by using the backstepping design method, the stochastic nonlinear systems can only be made to be bounded in probability and it is difficult to achieve the H∞ performance criterion due to the positive constant term appeared in the stability analysis. Thus, a novel concept with regard to the bounded-H∞ performance is proposed in this paper to overcome the design difficulty. By using the new concept and the adaptive neural network technique as well as Gronwall inequality, an adaptive neural network prescribed performance bounded-H∞ tracking controller is designed. Therein, neural networks are used to approximate the unknown packaged nonlinear functions. The assumption that the approximation errors of neural networks are square-integrable in some literature is eliminated. The designed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop stochastic nonlinear systems are bounded in probability, the tracking error is constrained into an adjustable neighborhood of the origin with the prescribed performance bounds, and the controlled system has a given H∞ disturbance attenuation performance for external disturbances.

A more general coupled nonlinearity is considered as perturbations of the network, while a serious faulty network named deteriorated network is also proposed to be further study. For the sake of eliminating these adverse impacts for synchronization, indirect adaptive schemes are designed to construct controllers and adjusters on pinned nodes and nonuniform couplings of un-pinned nodes, respectively. According to Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed adaptive strategies are successful in ensuring the achievement of asymptotic synchronization of the complex network even in the presence of perturbed and deteriorated networks. The proposed schemes are physically implemented by circuitries and tested by simulation on a Chua's circuit network.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2202246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6222060","Adaptive pinning control;circuit realization;network deterioration;nonlinear coupling networks;synchronization","Couplings;Synchronization;Adaptive systems;Complex networks;Biological neural networks;Vectors;Chaos","adaptive control;asymptotic stability;Chua's circuit;complex networks;control nonlinearities;control system synthesis;Lyapunov methods;perturbation techniques;synchronisation","adaptive pinning control design;deteriorated nonlinear coupling networks;circuit realization;complex networks;asymptotic synchronization;coupling adjustment strategies;coupled nonlinearity;indirect adaptive schemes;controller;adjusters;nonuniform couplings;unpinned nodes;pinned nodes;Lyapunov stability theory;perturbed networks;deteriorated networks;Chua's circuit network","","74","","47","","20 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is generally regarded that FL primarily deals with imprecision, NN with learning, and PR with uncertainty. They have, however, overlapping boundaries and are known to be complementary rather than competitive to each other in many applications. Here, two control algorithms, one implemented by fuzzy logic and the other by a neural network, are used as the basis to highlight salient features of soft computing. A DC motor servo system with the proposed soft computing based algorithms is discussed. The fuzzy logic control employs the principles of fuzzy logic to calculate an optimal output action based on input conditions, and a knowledge base expressed in linguistic forms, thereby performing a parallel operation to control the output with a high degree of robustness against parameter change. In the neural network control, focus is on how neural networks can overcome deadzone-plus-saturation nonlinearity commonly found in the power driver of a DC servo motor. Simulation results have been performed to establish the validity of these control algorithms.<>","","","10.1049/ic:19950762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=405132","","Adaptive control;DC motor drives;Fuzzy control;Neural networks;Optimal control;Servomotors;Uncertain systems","adaptive control;DC motor drives;fuzzy control;machine control;neural nets;optimal control;power engineering computing;servomotors;uncertain systems","electrical drives control;soft-computing;fuzzy logic;artificial neural networks;probabilistic reasoning;imprecision;learning;uncertainty;overlapping boundaries;DC motor servo system;optimal output;knowledge base;linguistic form","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Most of the contemporary AI is still expressed as hard-coded scripts. The complexity and manageability of the script codebase is one of the key limiting factors for further AI improvements. In this paper, we address this issue. We present behavior objects (BO)-a general approach to development of NPC behaviors for large OWGs. BOs are inspired by object-oriented programming and extend the concept of smart objects. Our approach promotes encapsulation of data and code for multiple related behaviors in one place, hiding internal details and embedding intelligence in the environment. BOs are a natural abstraction of five different techniques that we have implemented to manage AI complexity in an upcoming AAA OWG.

In this survey six disciplines were chosen: computational fluid dynamics, nano-electronic device and general physics, computational chemistry, structural analysis, computer aided optimal design, computational bio-medicine. Interestingly, according to the results of the survey, users of each computational science field were already familiar with the user interfaces of the simulation tools they had used before EDISON, and hoped that EDISON would have similar one. In addition, although the effectiveness of learning has been improved through practice, it is difficult for first learners because of quantitative and qualitative shortage of user and theory manuals. Lastly, the most important factor was the lecturer's explanation to use the computational science platform and find the meaning of the simulation results.

Firstly, the desired position signal of each motor is designed to guarantee the precise output tracking. By incorporating the desired position signal and synchronization error, the generalized coupling error is proposed to transform the coupling issue of tracking and synchronization into the convergence of generalized coupling error. Based on the generalized coupling error, the adaptive NN-based integral sliding mode control is investigated to simultaneously achieve load position tracking and motor synchronization, which can successfully address the contradiction between overshoot and rapidness to further provide the little overshoot tracking performance with short settling time. Moreover, the NN is employed to approximate and compensate for the complicated nonlinearity, where the novel switching learning law is proposed to guarantee asymptotic error convergence rather than ultimately uniformly bounded.

Among the existing results for handling this issue, the quadratic program approaches, which are capable of optimizing performance indices subject to physical constraints, are widely used. However, the existing quadratic program approaches require exactly knowing all the physical parameters of manipulators, the condition of which may not hold in some practical applications. This fact motivates us to consider the application of adaptive control techniques for simultaneous parameter identification and neural control. However, the inherent nonlinearity and nonsmoothness of the neural model prohibits direct applications of adaptive control to this model and there has been no existing result on adaptive control of robotic arms using projection neural network (PNN) approaches with parameter convergence. Different from conventional treatments in joint angle space, we investigate the problem from the joint speed space and decouple the nonlinear part of the Jacobian matrix from the structural parameters that need to be learnt. Based on the new representation, we establish the first adaptive PNN with online learning for the redundancy resolution of manipulators with unknown physical parameters, which tackles the dilemmas in existing methods. The proposed method is capable of simultaneously optimizing performance indices subject to physical constraints and handling parameter uncertainty. Theoretical results are presented to guarantee the performance of the proposed neural network.

Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer.

However, it is often challenging and unintuitive to design meaningful cost functions and build high-fidelity models while adhering to timing restrictions. A novel framework to extract and design principled regularization heuristics for legged locomotion optimization control is presented. By allowing a simulation to fully explore the cost space offline, certain states and actions can be constrained or isolated. Data is fit with simple models relating the desired commands, optimal control actions, and robot states to identify new heuristic candidates. Basic parameter learning and adaptation laws are then applied to the models online. This method extracts simple, but powerful heuristics that can approximate complex dynamics and account for errors stemming from model simplifications and parameter uncertainty without the loss of physical intuition while generalizing the parameter tuning process. Results on the Mini Cheetah robot verify the increased capabilities due to the newly extracted heuristics without any modification to the controller structure or gains.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197488","","Cost function;Legged locomotion;Data models;Tuning;Predictive control","adaptive control;control system synthesis;learning (artificial intelligence);legged locomotion;motion control;optimisation;predictive control","legged locomotion heuristics;regularized predictive control;legged robots;dynamic maneuvers;difficult terrains;meaningful cost functions;high-fidelity models;timing restrictions;principled regularization heuristics;legged locomotion optimization control;cost space offline;desired commands;optimal control actions;robot states;heuristic candidates;adaptation laws;models online;powerful heuristics;approximate complex dynamics;model simplifications;parameter uncertainty;parameter tuning process;increased capabilities;newly extracted heuristics;controller structure;mini cheetah robot","","2","","23","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research questions: How do the factors mentioned in the literature function in an international engineering project? Are there factors that enhance or constrain the work in an engineering setting that are not mentioned in previous studies? Literature review: Existing knowledge on the contextual factors that affect virtual international professional communication is mainly built on the study of the communication practices of students or business professionals who are not engineers. Results of that literature have identified factors that enhance communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include cross-cultural training, using appropriate communication technology, face-to-face communication opportunities, respect for partners, regularly scheduled meetings, a common language, a common discipline, and cross-cultural understandings though popular media). There are factors that challenge communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include differing cultural assumptions, differing cultural communication styles, US Government export control regulations, proximity and time issues, and differing levels of perceived power and influence). Methodology: This study involved observing international engineer meetings in the US and the UK and interviewing 19 engineers leading an international design team. The participants worked for the same international company with about half from the US and half in Great Britain. Results and discussion: Many of the factors identified in general professional communication studies held true for this context. But some features were unique to an engineering environment that the literature had not previously mentioned, including iplanning for and working with intercultural dispersed virtual engineering teams and that people need to consider many complexities of culture that affect communication practices. Because this study observed one team in the context of only two cultures, future research may determine whether these factors are more widely found in other teams, workplaces, and cultures. Future research may also determine the relative levels of influence of the contextual factors on international dispersed virtual engineering teams. In addition, the study of engineers learning to communicate in international settings may be illuminating.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2014.2363893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951500","Case study;dispersed virtual teams;international engineering communication","Cultural differences;Virtual groups;Global communication;Context modeling;Communications technology;Design methodology;Research initiatives","design engineering;project engineering;virtual reality","international engineering communication;United States design team;British design team;international engineering project;virtual engineering teams","","7","","18","","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a cognitive radio network to achieve this goal, spectrum policies and the ability to enforce them are necessary. Detection of an unauthorized (anomalous) usage is one of the critical issues in spectrum etiquette enforcement. In this paper, we present a network structure for dynamic spectrum access and formulate the anomalous usage detection problem using statistical significance testing. The detection problem is classified into two subproblems. For the case where no authorized signal is present, we describe the existing cooperative sensing schemes and investigate the impact of signal path loss on their performance. For the case where an authorized signal is present, we propose three methods that detect anomalous transmissions by making use of the characteristics of radio propagation. Analytical models are formulated for two special cases and, due to the intractability of the general problem, we present an algorithm using machine learning techniques to solve the general case. Our simulation results show that our approaches can effectively detect unauthorized spectrum usage with high detection rate and low false positive rate.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061975","","Radio transmitters;Power measurement;Access protocols;Chromium;Radio propagation;Signal detection;Cognitive radio;Signal processing;Communications Society;TV","authorisation;cognitive radio;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;radio access networks;radiowave propagation;statistical testing;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","anomaly detection framework;dynamic spectrum access network;scarce radio resource sharing;protocol;cognitive radio network;statistical significance testing;machine learning;authorized transmitter;cooperative sensing scheme;radio propagation","","48","","26","","2 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wireless sniffers are usually deployed to collect PHY/MAC-layer information to trace abnormal wireless traffic. For multi-channel wireless networks, it becomes problematic to allocate each sniffer an appropriate monitoring channel due to the limited number of sniffers. This leads to the sniffer-channel assignment (SCA) problem that has been mostly studied assuming error-free channel conditions or known behavior of wireless users. In this paper, we study the SCA problem with more general settings. In particular, we introduce redundant sniffer deployment to combat against the unreliable channel conditions. This can be formulated as a non-linear integer program with the aim of maximizing the number of captured data packets. We propose both centralized and distributed algorithms to determine an optimal strategy. For unknown user behaviors, we formulate the redundant SCA problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and develop an online learning policy to find a balance between the exploitation, i.e., accuracy, and exploration, i.e., coverage, in channel monitoring. Simulation results reveal that the redundant sniffer deployment, though sacrificing the exploration opportunities in the learning process, is robust against the uncertainty of user activities and provides the optimal performance in terms of sensing accuracy and monitoring coverage.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2019.2937487","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shenzhen Talent Peacock Plan Program; ASTAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant Call on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing RGANS1906, WASP/NTU M4082187 (4080), Singapore MOE Tier 1; MOE Tier 2; Singapore NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277, and Singapore EMA Energy Resilience; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8815838","Passive monitoring;redundant sniffer deployment;monotonic optimization;multi-armed bandit","Monitoring;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks;Forensics;Reliability;Distributed algorithms","access protocols;channel allocation;distributed algorithms;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels","redundant sniffer deployment;multichannel wireless network forensics;unreliable conditions;network traffic;wireless sniffers;abnormal wireless traffic;multichannel wireless networks;appropriate monitoring channel;sniffer-channel assignment problem;error-free channel conditions;wireless users;unreliable channel conditions;redundant SCA problem;channel monitoring","","1","","26","IEEE","27 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the system functions are subject to uncertainties, the control gain of the hitting control law can be adjusted to be a larger value to ensure the system stability. However, the control performance can not be guaranteed by the simple manner. So, in order to improve the control performance in this situation, an adaptive Fourier compensator is proposed to further compensate the sliding decoupling control law; the obtained control performance can be similar to that of the ideal sliding decoupling control law.

An adaptive neural output-feedback controller is developed based on the backstepping technique and the universal approximation property of the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. By using the Lyapunov stability analysis, the semiglobally and uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals within the closed-loop system is guaranteed.

Many of them are managed by universities or educational organizations, while the others are stages for know-how sharing by professionals and long-life learners. Despite the impact of all of these sites they lack a very important feature, which is vital for gaining hands-on experience - they do not provide means to perform any sort of practical exercises. In order to solve this challenge several new ways for distance and virtual learning have emerged. Many of the old e-learning sites and platforms have started to provide new means for performing simulation or emulation tasks and exercises, while other have invested into the development of entirely new and sometimes proprietary web-based solutions for performing these tasks. Lately a different type of solutions have emerged - ones that provide the possibility to perform tasks on real equipment. There are two ways in achieving this - trough virtualization of real devices and trough remote access to real equipment. While the first method is cheaper, since it does not require the purchase of the devices that are being virtualized it is not that reliable and sometimes it is not possible to fully virtualize a device or all of its features. This has clearly pointed out the remote access to real devices as the only available solution for gaining high quality hands-on experience. Despite the productivity and the guaranteed quality of this method it can be very hard to implement it. This is due to the fact that the remote access methods provide several challenges of their own. Many devices are simply not designed to be used remotely - a solution to this issue is to use middleware devices, which emulate a local connection with the targeted device and at the same time provide remote access from the outside network. A different challenge is to use the right method for establishing the remote access. There are several protocols and standards for this and each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks. Last but not least the process of setting the middleware devices can be very challenging.

In this paper, a series parallel neural network architecture has been proposed for parametric system identification, whose weights are optimized using adaptive learning through training data, collected from unknown nonlinear system. The optimized weights of the proposed ANN structure are then directly utilized to model the unknown system, in terms of an equivalent discrete transfer function model. The estimated model using proposed technique can be effectively utilized to analyze, test and control the unknown system dynamics.

For each mode, the algorithm takes into account several key points at the I-AUV and several obstacles. For navigation we fully wrap the I-AUV with a small number of safety spheres, while, for intervention the number of safety spheres used increases, having smaller diameters to allow for more precise motion of the I-AUV near the intervention areas. The framework was implemented and simulated with a 8-DOF I-AUV (GIRONA500) in an Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair (IMR) scenario like those commonly encountered in oil and gas industry. The subsea infrastructure used in the scenario was represented by an Octomap, with each occupied cell being considered an obstacle. The I-AUV performed a mission, inspecting the infrastructure in Inspection Mode and later on, turning a valve in Intervention Mode, without colliding with the environment and ensuring a safe distance to obstacles at all times.","2377-6536","978-1-7281-0253-5","10.1109/AUV.2018.8729721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8729721","I-AUV;obstacle avoidance;task-priority;BOP structure;octomap","Task analysis;Collision avoidance;Safety;Manipulators;Kinematics;Jacobian matrices","autonomous underwater vehicles;collision avoidance;gas industry;inspection;learning systems;mobile robots;motion control;navigation;path planning;remotely operated vehicles;robot vision;underwater vehicles","I-AUV;intervention areas;general obstacle avoidance framework;safety spheres;inspection mode;task-priority kinematic control algorithm;intervention mode;GIRONA500;inspection maintenance and repair scenario;oil and gas industry;octomap","","1","","12","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The newly developed national Diploma in Engineering also includes elements of electronics. This paper briefly describes this history and its impact on the way electronics has been and is conceived in English schools. Like other physical science subjects, electronics in school suffers from a lack of specialist teachers and the perception that is 'hard'. Since 1998 the Electronics in Schools Strategy (EiSS), with funding from a range of agencies, including the English Government departments of Trade & Industry and Education & Science and the Institute of Electrical Engineers (now the Institute of Engineering and Technology), has been engaged in supporting the national development of electronics in schools. Tactics employed by EiSS include school-based curriculum development, the development of an extensive website of support for both teachers of electronics and their pupils, training trainers who are funded to offer substantial free training to schools and the development of regional EiSS hubs with a brief and funding to support local initiatives that will support electronics teaching and learning in schools. Throughout the life of EiSS there has been a focus on the evaluation of effectiveness measured by the degree of impact on teachers and pupils and implementation of good quality electronics in schools. This paper summarises the findings of this evaluation effort. At the same time a wealth of ICT-based educational electronics resources has been developed by UK companies including high quality PCB CAD and CAM, pupil-friendly yet powerful electronics simulation and straightforward approaches to the inclusion of microcontroller and communications technologies into pupil projects. Electronics-focussed work in schools has also been influenced by other developments going on in the wider subject of Design & Technology such as thinking about how to foster creativity in pupils, work to develop more sustainable approaches to pupils' designing and making and attempts to get pupils to design for the future, in particular through the Young Foresight initiative. The paper reflects on how the combination of high quality support for schools allied to excellent teaching resources has impacted on the approaches taken by teachers and the quality of pupils' work, illustrated with examples taken from schools involved with EiSS. The paper finishes by reflecting on the challenges and opportunities to electronics in education that are offered by developments in research and industrial electronics and presents some early findings from new curriculum development projects working in these areas.","","978-1-4244-1915-9","10.1109/MGDETE.2007.4760345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760345","","Educational institutions;Industrial electronics;Curriculum development;Physics education;Science - general;History;Government;Electronics industry;Educational technology;Design automation","computer aided instruction;electronic engineering education;teaching","electronics education;English school curriculum;electronics teaching;ICT-based educational electronics resources","","2","","23","","23 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a new Bayesian predictive approach, referred to as the Bayesian adaptive design of experiments, for sequential design of experiments that aims to combine experimentation and optimization stages in order to start production more quickly with a small amount of process data. A dual control approach that simultaneously considers model estimation and optimization objectives is adopted and an adaptive Bayesian response surface model is used. It is shown that the optimal solution of the experimental settings can be determined either numerically for the case of a general second-order model or in analytical closed-form for the case of a first-order model. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated with a simulation example and a real semiconductor process data taken from the literature. It is shown that by employing the proposed adaptive Bayesian approach one can simultaneously learn the process while not requiring excessive perturbations away from the target level and can achieve faster model estimation than central composite experimental designs. The learning weight used in the dual cost function allows one to tune the relative weights of learning and control goals depending on the uncertainty about the process model.","1558-2345","","10.1109/TSM.2011.2129545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741867","Adaptive control;Bayesian analysis;response surface methods;sequential design of experiments","Adaptation model;Bayesian methods;Process control;Production;Data models;Manufacturing;Response surface methodology","adaptive control;Bayes methods;design of experiments;estimation theory;process control;response surface methodology;semiconductor device manufacture;semiconductor device reliability","adaptive Bayesian method;semiconductor manufacturing process control;experimental data sets;capital intensive semiconductor manufacturing processes;large designed experiments;statistical models;reliably estimating optimal conditions;Bayesian predictive approach;Bayesian adaptive design of experiments;sequential design of experiments;experimentation stages;optimization stages;dual control approach;adaptive Bayesian response surface model;second-order model;semiconductor process data;adaptive Bayesian approach;model estimation;central composite experimental designs;learning weight;dual cost function","","2","","38","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is because girls are harder to engage and motivate than boys. Given a game, boys rush to beat the game. Girls? The challenges are bigger because of their characteristics of being more reserved, taking their own sweet time to explore. For the reasons, more than ever, girls' preferences and needs are less addressed. This study examines girls' preferences in terms of a user interface's form and content. In terms of form, i. e. the physical appearance attributes such as layout, contrast, balance, screen objects and other associated display elements of the interface are examined. A sample content of girls' type comic is used as the domain for analysis. The comic is given a persona name iCOMIC: Fatihah. The content was created based on 25 girls experience and their affective values. Their life stories were combined, mixed and recreated in an attempt to indirectly teach girls about moral, ethical and cultural knowledge. In this study we assume that the display's characteristics are dominant in adding interest towards `learning'. Using 12 randomly selected girls of age 7 till 19 as our subjects, we studied their preferences towards the interface design using Cooper's primary pesona design. The preferences are analysed and translated into the iCOMIC interface, as an implication of the study. The study found out that there are significant deviations from the HCI general rule in terms of a user interface's form design for girls. With such interface, one of the most important HCI research agenda is addressed, i. e. to provide techniques for information understanding.","","978-1-4577-1655-3","10.1109/iUSEr.2011.6150532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150532","interface for girls;form and content;comic;comic interface;persona enquiry","Games;Prototypes;Software;Educational institutions;Layout;Containers;Cultural differences","cultural aspects;design engineering;ethical aspects;gender issues;human computer interaction;user interfaces","interface design;user interface content factors;comic container;educational games;leisure applications;girl preferences;girl need;user interface form;physical appearance attributes;layout;contrast;balance;screen objects;iCOMIC;Fatihah;moral knowledge;ethical knowledge;cultural knowledge;display characteristics;Cooper primary pesona design;HCI;information understanding","","4","","13","","13 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the DNN decoding unit is obtained by parameterizing the max-log- MAP algorithm rather than replace the whole decoder with a black box fully connected DNN architecture. With the proposed architecture, the parameters can be efficiently learned from training data, and thus TurboNet learns to appropriately use systematic and parity information to offer higher error correction capabilities and decrease computational complexity compared with existing methods.

Within such an environment, the problem of scheduling the network users across the radio resources might become a bottleneck of the system. In this paper, we study the problem of fully distributed scheduling in C-RAN systems. The idea is that each user's base band processing unit (BBU) tries to guess whether its user should be scheduled or not. First, we focus on the case of maximum throughput scheduling and Rayleigh channels, and provide closed-form expression for the expected effective channel and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the distributed scenario. In order to deal with general channels and schedulers, we adopt the classification techniques from machine learning. We discover an interesting relationship between the fairness of the scheduler, and its ability to be distributed. In particular, schedulers which are more fair are also more prune to prediction errors in the distributed scenario. Finally, we provide simulation results that show that distributed scheduling can provide up to 90% of the performance of the centralized case.","1558-2612","978-1-4673-9814-5","10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7564873","","Scheduling;Cloud computing;Signal to noise ratio;Computer architecture;Processor scheduling;Throughput;Rayleigh channels","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;pattern classification;radio access networks;Rayleigh channels;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling","fully distributed scheduling;cloud-RAN system;cloud radio access network;cloud computing capability;next generation 5G network coverage enhancement;next generation 5G network quality enhancement;bandwidth resource;baseband processing;network user scheduling problem;radio resource;C-RAN system;BBU;throughput scheduling;Rayleigh channel;closed-form expression;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;classification technique;machine learning","","2","","19","","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software testing was conducted among high school students in order to assess the controllability, functionality, and usability aspects of Myo Ball, as well as to develop an idea regarding the students' perception of Myo Ball as a learning tool. Statistical tests were conducted to determine the accuracy of the physics values displayed by Myo Ball.

In general, 3D meshes consist of two distinct components: vertex positions and vertex connectivity. Vertex position encoders are much more resource demanding than connectivity encoders, stressing the need for novel geometry compression schemes. The design of an accurate and energy efficient geometry compression system can be achieved by: i) reducing the amount of data that should be transmitted ii) minimizing the computational operations executed at the encoder. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian learning approach that allows processing large meshes in parts and reconstructing the Cartesian coordinates of each part from a small number of random linear combinations. The proposed compression/reconstruction approaches minimize the samples that are required for transmission yet assuring accurate reconstruction at the receiver, by exploiting specific local characteristics of the surface geometry in the graph Fourier domain. Simulation studies show that the proposed schemes, as compared to the state of the art approaches, achieve competitive Compression Ratios (CRs), offering at the same time significantly lower compression computational complexity, which is essential for mobile cloud computing platforms.","","978-1-5090-0481-2","10.1109/ISSPIT.2015.7394369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7394369","","Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Geometry;Encoding;Computational modeling;Decoding;Laplace equations","Bayes methods;belief networks;cloud computing;encoding;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;telecommunication computing;telecommunication power management","dense 3D mesh sparse coding;mobile cloud applications;mobile cloud computing platform;3D mesh transmission;3D mesh storage;3D mesh acquisition;vertex position encoder;vertex connectivity;geometry compression scheme;energy efficient geometry compression system design;Bayesian learning approach;Cartesian coordinates;random linear combinations;graph Fourier domain;surface geometry","","3","","15","","1 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the convergence rate of the proposed parameter update law is improved significantly due to the consideration of the recorded data in the construction of the filtered regression vector/matrix.

The most popular branches of the classical and novel adaptive approaches are analyzed in comparison with methods needing complete, accurate, and permanent models or applying only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent ones that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing iterative learning control. It will also be shown that in the case of the novel approach the conditions of convergence normally can be satisfied by choosing very primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters on the basis of simple geometric considerations. It will be pointed out that while the traditional adaptive approaches are applicable only for learning linearly separable dynamical system parameters and fail for the permanent presence of unknown external disturbances and linearly non-separable (e.g. friction model) parameters, the novel approach can well compensate the simultaneous effects of imprecise and linearly non-separable model parameters and external perturbations, too. Since in contrast to the traditional solutions that normally guarantee global (asymptotic) stability by using Lyapunov functions, the novel approach can assure only local region of stability that in principle can be left by the system's state, a real time simulation tool has been developed to study the robustness of the novel control versus the variation of the adaptive control parameters. It will also be stressed that the traditional approaches have a huge number of adaptive control parameters that generally cannot optimally be set, the novel approach have only a few control parameters that can easily be tuned by observing the behavior of the controlled system. The already achieved results will be exemplified by simulation studies using the same paradigm.","","978-1-4244-5310-8","10.1109/ICCCYB.2009.5393937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5393937","","Adaptive control;Robust stability;Programmable control;Asymptotic stability;Optimal control;Stress control;Control systems;Tellurium;Control system synthesis;Convergence","adaptive control;iterative methods;learning systems;nonlinear control systems","adaptive control;nonlinear control;iterative learning control;Lyapunov functions","","2","","48","","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, facial part in the whole image is located with Adaboost algorithm; the human-eye area is positioned through the hybrid feature extraction method. In extraction process, edge density, chrominance, HSV and skin color cues are applied separately. Some of the regions are then removed by applying rules that are based on the general geometry and shape of eyes. The remaining connected regions obtained through these four cues are then combined in a systematic way to enhance the identification of the candidate regions for the eyes.

By applying uniform structures derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations in the most general and formal level the method is a compromise between the classic hard computing (HC) and soft computing (SC). Thus typical difficulties in traditional SC as the a priori unknown number of the necessary free parameters, the scaling problems and the need for full system identification are evaded.

In addition, since OFDM systems require accurate channel estimations to function properly, this treatise also proposes a new channel estimation algorithm for OFDM systems that combine the power of deep learning (DL) with the philosophy of super-resolution reconstruction, which uses dense convolutional neural networks (Dense-Nets) to reconstruct low-resolution pilot information images into high-resolution full-channel impulse responses (CIRs). The Dense-Net structure has the characteristics of dense connections and feature multiplexing. The simulation results show that under slow fading, the proposed channel estimator (CE) can estimate the CIRs perfectly.

However, as the existing literature is overwhelmingly based on theoretical or simulation results, it is unclear how well DMC performs in practice. In this paper we study the performance of DMC in real-world wireless networks, using an extensive RF signal dataset of 250,000 over-the-air transmissions with heterogeneous transceiver hardware and co-channel interference. Our results show that DMC can achieve a high classification accuracy even under the challenging real-world conditions of modulated co-channel interference and low-grade hardware. However, this only holds if the training dataset fully captures the variety of interference and hardware types in the real radio environment; otherwise, the DMC performance deteriorates significantly. Our work has two important engineering implications. First, it shows that it is not straightforward to exchange learned classifier models among dissimilar radio environments and devices in practice. Second, our analysis suggests that the key missing link for real-world deployment of DMC is designing signal features that generalize well to diverse wireless network scenarios. We are making our RF signal dataset publicly available as a step towards a unified framework for realistic DMC evaluation.","2334-3125","978-1-5386-5191-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2018.8610499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8610499","Signal classification;digital modulation classification;spectrum awareness;support vector machine","Monte Carlo methods;Signal to noise ratio;Hardware;Training;Feature extraction;OFDM;Modulation","learning (artificial intelligence);modulation;radio networks;radio transceivers;signal classification;telecommunication computing","cochannel interference;DMC evaluation;RF signals;wireless networks;classifier models learning;digital modulation classification;signal features;DMC performance;radio environment;heterogeneous transceiver hardware","","4","","18","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, it is difficult to adopt a model-based design to achieve this control objective due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances, and parameter variations. In order to cope with this problem, an indirect AFNNC (IAFNNC) scheme and a direct AFNNC (DAFNNC) strategy are investigated without the requirement of prior system information. In these model-free control topologies, a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) dynamic fuzzy model with online learning ability is constructed to represent the system dynamics of an n-link robot manipulator. In the IAFNNC, an FNN estimator is designed to tune the nonlinear dynamic function vector in fuzzy local models, and then, the estimative vector is used to indirectly develop a stable IAFNNC law. In the DAFNNC, an FNN controller is directly designed to imitate a predetermined model-based stabilizing control law, and then, the stable control performance can be achieved by only using joint position information. All the IAFNNC and DAFNNC laws and the corresponding adaptive tuning algorithms for FNN weights are established in the sense of Lyapunov stability analyses to ensure the stable control performance. Numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by dc servomotors are given to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodologies. In addition, the superiority of the proposed control schemes is indicated in comparison with proportional-differential control, fuzzy-model-based control, T-S-type FNN control, and robust neural fuzzy network control systems.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595627","Adaptive control;fuzzy neural network (FNN);Lyapunov stability analyses;robot manipulator;Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model;Adaptive control;fuzzy neural network (FNN);Lyapunov stability analyses;robot manipulator;Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model","Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy control;Manipulator dynamics;Adaptive systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Control design;Robots;Actuators;Proportional control","actuators;adaptive control;continuous time systems;fuzzy neural nets;Lyapunov methods;manipulator dynamics;neurocontrollers;robust control;time-varying systems","adaptive fuzzy neural network control design;T-S fuzzy model;robot manipulator;actuator dynamics;high-precision position tracking;model-based design;continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno dynamic fuzzy model;online learning ability;model-based stabilizing control law;Lyapunov stability analyses;proportional-differential control;robust neural fuzzy network control systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Motion;Neural Networks (Computer);Robotics","83","","22","","12 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

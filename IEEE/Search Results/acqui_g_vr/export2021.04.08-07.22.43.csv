This research was initiated and applied in an area of engineering where tacit knowledge predominates; that of manual assembly planning. In this domain the evaluation and formalization of tacit knowledge is very difficult. Assembly planning is generally undertaken by planning 'experts' who produce plans after studying design data in whatever form. Research at Heriot-Watt University has shown that immersive virtual reality (VR) offers significant potential for the interactive planning of mechanical assemblies. Using this system for gathering assembly intent, a knowledge elicitation methodology was developed in which expert assembly planners' activities were logged while building a virtual assembly. This involved four main stages in its application: definition of the salient component attributes (repertory grid analysis); evaluation of attributes for given components (manual evaluation); recording expert assembly usage data (nonintrusive VR data logging); and generating rules relating the components to specific assembly methods (induction). This paper demonstrates how this novel nonintrusive knowledge acquisition methodology can be applied using immersive virtual environments; implying that, as globalizes technology becomes available, this may be a route to the formalization of company know-how.","","1-890843-02-4","10.1109/PICMET.1999.808115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=808115","","Knowledge engineering;Virtual reality;Assembly systems;Knowledge based systems;Design engineering;Chemical engineering;Informatics;Expert systems;Heart;Buildings","knowledge acquisition;assembly planning;virtual reality;interactive systems","expert knowledge elicitation;virtual engineering environments;knowledge based systems;manual assembly planning;Heriot-Watt University;immersive virtual reality;interactive planning;mechanical assemblies;virtual assembly;repertory grid analysis;manual evaluation;nonintrusive VR data logging;nonintrusive knowledge acquisition methodology","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finally, the results of simulation experiments are given to compare the proposed method with other scheduling methods. The result shows that the superiority of the proposed scheduler. In the process of developing the scheduler, a general methodology for the development of a simulator and the clustering method for system states were developed. The proposed methodology for the development of simulators seems to be useful for developing simulators for various domains.

Weight decay has also been shown to improve a network's generalization performance. Simulations with two small DFA (/spl les/10 states) and a large finite-memory machine (64 states) demonstrate that the performance improvement due to pruning/retraining is generally superior to the improvement due to training with weight decay.

The first step decides the general color change timing of the maple tree based on its local environment. Then we make further adjustments to the timing determined in the last step taking into account the influence of climate in the specific case. In the last step, the texture maps of leaves are generated based on the pigment information.

However, uneven breaths may yield a considerable motion artifact in the reconstructed time sequences of volume ultrasound. In this paper, a system with sparse respiratory signal matching is proposed to realize accurate 4D ultrasound reconstruction by effectively estimating uneven breaths. A slippery platform is built to automatically control the ultrasonic probe for acquiring 2D ultrasound slice sequences in different abdominal areas. Based on these acquired sequences, the signals of the respiratory phases are first extracted. Second, the sparse matched signal pairs are determined through the signal distribution and the corresponding image connectivity. After matching is conducted, signals in different positions are aligned in a common space wherein the outliers of the signals caused by the uneven breaths are excluded. Third, images with the same signal value in different positions are collected as the 3D image at the phase corresponding to the signal, and the 3D images at different phases are employed to reconstruct the final 4D image. The accuracies of the reconstructed 4D image are evaluated and compared with those of five existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the spatial and temporal continuities of the 4D ultrasound image reconstructed by our method outperform those obtained by other methods.","2333-9403","","10.1109/TCI.2021.3054527","National Key R&D Program of China; National Science and Technology Major Project of China; National Science Foundation Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9336276","4D reconstruction system;ultrasound image;respiratory signal;sparse matching","Ultrasonic imaging;Image reconstruction;Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays;Probes;Liver;Feature extraction","biomedical ultrasonics;image reconstruction;medical image processing;pneumodynamics","uneven breaths;considerable motion artifact;reconstructed time sequences;volume ultrasound;sparse respiratory signal matching;accurate 4D ultrasound reconstruction;2D ultrasound slice sequences;different abdominal areas;acquired sequences;respiratory phases;sparse matched signal pairs;signal distribution;corresponding image connectivity;signal value;final 4D image;reconstructed 4D image;4D ultrasound image;dimensional wide-field ultrasound reconstruction system;four-dimensional ultrasound reconstruction;spatial range;temporal range;two-dimensional ultrasound","","","","27","IEEE","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main goal is to provide an alternative to traditional training methods on animals, cadavers or real patients. Haptic feedback is a key feature for every surgery simulator for the training of hand-eye coordination. In this paper, a compact and portable haptic interface is presented for the colonoscopy. The haptic interface provides position data acquisition and force feedback in linear and rotational directions with combined electrical motors and passive brakes to cover a large range of forces. The motorized drives are used for active force feedback and friction compensation and the brakes are used for high force rendering without slipping.

In the development of this paper, we investigate the axiomatic correctness and semantic meaning of this rule and show that the recursive noisy OR is a generalization of the well-known noisy OR. We introduce the concept of positive causality and demonstrate its utility in axiomatic correctness of the RNOR.

Yet, because ultrasound is a highly operator dependent modality the uptake of ultrasound within a broader range of medical contexts has been limited and hasn't made major inroads within the offices of General Practitioners, Midwives, and other non-specialists. Learning to effectively use ultrasound can easily take up to 12 months with direct expert supervision. To facilitate wider adoption of ultrasound technology we are attempting to determine if using augmented-reality can speed up the process of learning to use ultrasound by providing a patient specific correspondence between the ultrasound data acquired in real-time and a sufficiently detailed augmented 3D scene. We have established a tablet-based system for visualizing the heart within a patients body using augmented-reality techniques in conjunction with the streaming data provided by a GE Vivid E9 ultrasound machine.

Inside the simulated environment, an observing agent, the one with the ability to recognize faces, can navigate and observe the real face images, at different distances, angles and with indoor or outdoor illumination. During the face recognition process, the agent can actively change its viewpoint and relative distance to the faces in order to improve the recognition results. The virtual environment provides all behaviors to the agent (navigation, positioning, face's image composing under different angles, etc.), except the ones related with the recognition of faces. This tool could be of high interest in HRI applications related with the visual recognition of humans.

Focusing on modes of interaction in this work, we examined the effect of different motion types on the knowledge acquisition of users in various virtual environments. For our study we chose a simple memorization task as approximation of low cognitive knowledge acquirement. We hypothesized motion types and immersion levels influence memorization performance in virtual environments. The memorization task was conducted in two virtual environments with different levels of immersion: A high-immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a low-immersive desktop virtual environment. Two motion types in virtual environments were explored: Physical and virtual walking. In the CAVE physical walking was implemented by using motion capturing and virtual walking was realized using a joystick-like input device.

Then, while video game play, EEG was recorded for 20 minutes. Analysis was made based on comparison between activation EEG data during game play and the baseline. EEG data was acquired using 19-channel EEG machine. The data was pre-processed to remove artifacts like eye blinking, eye movement and drowsiness. We used three EEG measures: absolute power, coherence and phase lag to analyse further analysed the data. The data were divided into four frequency bands. In general, beta band is associated with learning and making responses. In beta band (12-25 Hz), it was found that the absolute power was higher in occipital, parietal frontal and motor regions while playing video game as compared to sitting idly. For coherence, it was seen that the above mentioned regions were highly coherent in beta indicating connectivity between the regions.

This has important consequences for the quality of slice-followed acquisitions as the majority are acquired during free-breathing, with the correction factor implemented either being assumed to be fixed for all patients or having been determined through breath-holding acquisitions.","","0-7695-1113-9","10.1109/MIAR.2001.930266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930266","","Magnetic resonance;Angiography;Navigation;Arteries;Heart;Data acquisition;Hafnium;Educational institutions;Motion measurement;Signal resolution","biomedical MRI;angiocardiography;image motion analysis;pneumodynamics;blood vessels;medical image processing","subject-specific motion correction;magnetic resonance coronary angiography;artery motion;respiratory position;heart motion;diaphragm;breathing;slice-followed acquisitions;medical image processing","","2","4","14","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, researchers have developed numerous visual attention models for images and videos. However, existing studies on visual attention generally perform on spatial domain (i.e. pictures) without consideration on time-variant user attention. Besides, the user attention on immersive video playback has not been well investigated in Virtual Reality (VR) environment. In this paper, we design subjective experiments to acquire the user attention during 360-degree video playback, in order to characterize the visual attention changes on time axis. We compare and model the temporal attentions in two scenarios: 360-degree video and conventional 2D video display. It is observed in video display, the user attention needs a short period (~ 30 seconds) to concentrate to a relatively stable level. Within this period, the user attention to 360-degree video is significantly lower than that to traditional 2D videos, which shows that the users are relatively difficult to adapt to VR display. Therefore, short videos less than 30 seconds, especially short 360-degree videos, are not preferable in subjective video quality assessment, although they have been tested in some scenarios. We hope this conclusion would conduce to QoE modeling during video display of VR environment.","","978-1-5386-5838-3","10.1109/HAVE.2018.8547419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8547419","Virtual Reality (VR);360-degree video;visual attention;Quality of Experience (QoE);visual quality","Visualization;Two dimensional displays;Quality of experience;Resists;Solid modeling;Video recording;Quality assessment","data visualisation;quality of experience;video cameras;video signal processing;video streaming;virtual reality","time-variant visual attention;360-degree video playback;user visual attention;time-variant user attention;immersive video playback;visual attention changes;temporal attentions;video display;short videos;subjective video quality assessment;visual quality;visual attention models;quality of experience modeling;VR environment;QoE modeling;virtual reality environment","","1","","17","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mnemonics is a technique for memorizing a number of unstructured items that has been known for more than two millennia and was used in ancient Greece. Although its utility is remarkable, acquiring the skill to take advantage of mnemonics is generally difficult. In this study we propose a new method of increasing the effectiveness of classic mnemonics by facilitating the process of memorizing and applying mnemonics. The spatial electronic mnemonics (SROM) proposed here is partly based on an ancient technique that utilizes locations and images that reflect the characteristics of human memory. We first present the design of the SROM as a working hypothesis that augments traditional mnemonics using a portable computer. Then an augmented virtual memory peg (vMPeg) that incorporates a graphic numeral and a photograph of a location is introduced as a first implementation for generating a vMPeg. In an experiment, subjects exhibited remarkable retention of the vMPegs over a long interval. The second phase of placing items to remember on a generated vMPeg was also examined in a preliminary experiment, which also indicated good subject performance. In addition to evaluating the SROM by anylysing the scores for correct recall, a subjective evaluation was performed to investigate the nature of the SROM.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-1971-5","10.1109/VR.2008.4480777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4480777","Memory augmentation;Wearable computer;Visual images;Space and place;VR application;H.5.m [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Miscellaneous;K.3.1 [Computer Uses in Education]: Computer-assisted instruction (CAI)","Humans;Wearable computers;Graphics;Computer aided instruction;Pervasive computing;Portable computers;Virtual reality;Application software;Computer interfaces;Electronic mail","augmented reality;neurophysiology;virtual reality;wearable computers","spatial electronic mnemonics;human memory augmentation;wearable devices;smartphone devices;portable computer;augmented virtual memory peg;vMPeg;SROM","","2","","14","","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automated data collection through instrumented vehicles provides the first opportunity to collect cycle time data in a continuous manner and hence, provide a statistically reliable data set. This paper presents the use of automated data to fit probabilistic distributions that are used as input to simulation models.

Point process generalized linear models and maximum likelihood estimation have been proposed as effective methods for the identification of spiking dependency between neurons. However, unfavorable experimental conditions occasionally results in insufficient data collection due to factors such as low neuronal firing rates or brief recording periods, and in these cases, the standard maximum likelihood estimate becomes unreliable. The present studies compares the performance of different statistical inference procedures when applied to the estimation of functional connectivity in neuronal assemblies with sparse spiking data. Four inference methods were compared: maximum likelihood estimation, penalized maximum likelihood estimation, using either l2 or l1 regularization, and hierarchical Bayesian estimation based on a variational Bayes algorithm. Algorithmic performances were compared using well-established goodness-of-fit measures in benchmark simulation studies, and the hierarchical Bayesian approach performed favorably when compared with the other algorithms, and this approach was then successfully applied to real spiking data recorded from the cat motor cortex. The identification of spiking dependencies in physiologically acquired data was encouraging, since their sparse nature would have previously precluded them from successful analysis using traditional methods.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2086079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599306","Conjugate gradient;interior-point method;functional connectivity;maximum likelihood estimate (MLE);neuronal interactions;penalized maximum likelihood;point process generalized linear model;variational Bayes;$\ell_2$ regularization;$\ell_1$  regularization","Neurons;Bayesian methods;Maximum likelihood estimation;Approximation methods;Inference algorithms;Logistics;Approximation algorithms","Bayes methods;bioelectric phenomena;biology computing;brain;maximum likelihood estimation;neurophysiology;physiological models","statistical inference;functional connectivity;neuronal ensembles;sparse spiking data;spike train data;computational neuroscience;point process generalized linear models;maximum likelihood estimation;neuronal firing rates;hierarchical Bayesian estimation;variational Bayes algorithm;goodness-of-fit measures;cat motor cortex","Algorithms;Animals;Bayes Theorem;Cats;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrophysiological Phenomena;Likelihood Functions;Linear Models;Logistic Models;Models, Neurological;Motor Cortex;Neural Networks (Computer);Neural Pathways;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Reproducibility of Results","37","","51","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004.

Statistics on Riemannian manifolds are developed that exploit the full information in deformation tensor fields. In TBM, multiple brain images are warped to a common neuroanatomical template via 3-D nonlinear registration; the resulting deformation fields are analyzed statistically to identify group differences in anatomy. Rather than study the Jacobian determinant (volume expansion factor) of these deformations, as is common, we retain the full deformation tensors and apply a manifold version of Hotelling's test to them, in a Log-Euclidean domain. In 2-D and 3-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 26 HIV/AIDS patients and 14 matched healthy subjects, we compared multivariate tensor analysis versus univariate tests of simpler tensor-derived indices: the Jacobian determinant, the trace, geodesic anisotropy, and eigenvalues of the deformation tensor, and the angle of rotation of its eigenvectors. We detected consistent, but more extensive patterns of structural abnormalities, with multivariate tests on the full tensor manifold. Their improved power was established by analyzing cumulative-value plots using false discovery rate (FDR) methods, appropriately controlling for false positives. This increased detection sensitivity may empower drug trials and large-scale studies of disease that use tensor-based morphometry.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2007.906091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359948","Brain;image analysis;Lie groups;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);statistics","Human immunodeficiency virus;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Statistics;Tensile stress;Testing;Image analysis;Magnetic analysis;Jacobian matrices;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;image registration;Jacobian matrices;medical image processing;tensors","generalized tensor-based morphometry;HIV;AIDS;multivariate statistics;deformation tensors;Riemannian manifolds;brain images;image warping;neuroanatomical template;3-D nonlinear registration;Hotelling T2 test;log-Euclidean domain;magnetic resonance imaging;MRI;Jacobian determinant;geodesic anisotropy;eigenvalues;eigenvectors;false discovery rate;drug trials;disease","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Adult;Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Encephalitis, Viral;Female;HIV Infections;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","115","","107","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since HLA is a general-purpose architecture designed for simulation reuse and interoperability, it will be the standard through which JMASE simulations will communicate with other distributed simulation systems. Based on the characteristics and functions of JMASE as well as the interface specification of HLA, a JMASE-HLA framework is developed and its design is detailed in this paper.

To address this problem, this paper presents a novel algorithm to integrate generalized series (OS) imaging with parallel imaging using multiple receiver coils. This algorithm takes advantage of both the conventional parallel data acquisition scheme and the GS model-based reduced-scan imaging method to achieve higher spatiotemporal resolution in dynamic imaging. The algorithm has been validated using both simulated and experimental data from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI experiments, which produced excellent results.

Seeing that complex learning environments can foster the development of various cognitive abilities, like multiperspective reasoning skills (MPRS), such design principles are highly desirable. Using multiperspective hypermedia environments (MHEs) as a testbed, the presented project aims to identify and evaluate design principles, derived from cognitive science. We will create and study interactive, immersive 3D-interface to MHEs using virtual reality technology.

Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgical performance. The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene. Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance. The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons. An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training. The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis. The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing. Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.869771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597490","Dynamics;haptics;human machine interface;kinematics;manipulation;Markov model;minimally invasive;robotics;simulation;soft tissue;surgery;surgical skill assessment;surgical tool;vector quantization","Minimally invasive surgery;Stochastic processes;Kinematics;Performance analysis;Multidimensional systems;Information analysis;Information resources;Layout;Animal structures;Protocols","surgery;Markov processes;endoscopes;medical robotics;virtual reality;robot kinematics","minimally invasive surgery;stochastic process;discrete Markov model;visual information;surgical tool kinematics;surgical tool dynamics;Blue DRAGON;endoscopic tools;finite state model;objective learning curve;subjective performance analysis;laparoscopic suturing;surgical robots;virtual reality simulators","Computer Simulation;Endoscopes;Endoscopy;Expert Systems;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Markov Chains;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Robotics;Robotics;Stochastic Processes;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive;Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface","160","3","47","","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To manipulate some object with it, it is necessary to determine the contact points and grasping forces at the fingertips, but it is difficult to optimize such manipulation parameters for performing effective manipulation. In this paper, we propose an acquisition method for re-grasping motion for a four-fingered robot hand using evolutionary programming (EP). In this case, EP determines not only when and where the fingers are moved, but also which finger is operated at the next contact point according to the attitude changes of object grasping with the grasping stability. Evolutionary programming is generally able to find an optimal solution without a supervisor after much iteration, which is almost impractical using a real robot. Therefore we control the real robot hand with the optimal controller that has been obtained in computer simulations. We show the effectiveness of the proposed acquisition method for the re-grasping motion with experimental results.","","0-7803-5536-9","10.1109/CEC.1999.781949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=781949","","Genetic programming;Fingers;Grasping;Robot programming;Stability;Systems engineering and theory;Computer simulation;Humans;Actuators;Robot control","dexterous manipulators;evolutionary computation;digital simulation","re-grasping behavior acquisition;evolutionary programming;multi-fingered robot hand control;object manipulation;contact points;grasping forces;fingertips;optimal solution;iteration;computer simulations","","7","","6","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nonstationary imaging properties of the collimator are simulated using the generalized collimator transfer function; thereby avoiding the unrealistic approximations for camera response. The body is approximated as a cylinder having constant attenuation, and the source distribution is approximated as a summation of many 3-D Gaussian functions having different source strengths, center points, and widths. The camera trajectory is specified at each imaging position by the center of the camera crystal and an orthogonal matrix that determines the camera orientation. The constant attenuation, Gaussian sources, and generalized collimator transfer function combine to produce an analytic expression for the image intensity in each pixel. Poisson statistics are then used to simulate realistic SPECT images.

However, soft tissues often have elaborate nonlinear material characteristics. Most prominently, soft tissues are soft and compliant to small strains, but after initial deformations they are very resistant to further deformations even under large forces. Such material characteristic is referred as the nonlinear material incompliant which is computationally expensive and numerically difficult to simulate. This paper presents a constraint-based finite-element algorithm to simulate the nonlinear incompliant tissue materials efficiently for interactive simulation applications such as virtual surgery. Firstly, the proposed algorithm models the material stiffness behavior of soft tissues with a set of 3-D strain limit constraints on deformation strain tensors. By enforcing a large number of geometric constraints to achieve the material stiffness, the algorithm reduces the task of solving stiff equations of motion with a general numerical solver to iteratively resolving a set of constraints with a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel iterative process. Secondly, as a Gauss-Seidel method processes constraints individually, in order to speed up the global convergence of the large constrained system, a multiresolution hierarchy structure is also used to accelerate the computation significantly, making interactive simulations possible at a high level of details. Finally, this paper also presents a simple-to-build data acquisition system to validate simulation results with ex vivo tissue measurements. An interactive virtual reality-based simulation system is also demonstrated.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2326009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820761","Nonlinear soft tissue simulation and modeling;robotic-assisted surgery;virtual surgical training","Strain;Biological tissues;Materials;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Biological system modeling;Force","biomechanics;biomedical education;deformation;surgery;virtual reality","constraint-based soft tissue simulation;virtual surgical training;linear elastic model;soft tissue material properties;computational efficiency;nonlinear material characteristics;small strains;deformations;nonlinear material incompliant;interactive simulation;deformation strain tensors;strain limit constraints;geometric constraints;Gauss-Seidel iterative","Abdomen;Algorithms;Animals;Computer Simulation;Liver;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Reproducibility of Results;Robotic Surgical Procedures;Swine;User-Computer Interface","16","","25","","23 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the least invasive intervention, endoscopic surgery is the most popular approach for this aim. However, since these compact tumors reside in the deep (muscle/connective) tissues of the uterus, they are hardly visible using only the video stream provided by the endoscopic camera. Thus, conform to the current general trend in human surgery, in this paper we propose a multimodal approach to make these tumors more visible during endoscopic interventions, namely, the reconstruction of the whole three-dimensional model of the uterus from ultrasound images and segmentation of the fibroids using this modality. Then, we map the result of the segmentation on the surface of the uterus, hence they become visible during endoscopic surgery. Similar efforts have already been made, considering the usage of MRI for this purpose, but ultrasound image acquisition is more widely available, faster, and cheaper next to the lower image quality. Our aim is to use the output of the 3D ultrasound imaging device during the laparoscopic surgery. Our segmentation pipeline processes the ultrasound images and consists of Otsu's thresholding using a special mask derived from image averages and morphological snakes to extract uterus boundary. As the final step, we project the segmented 3D model of the uterus with its lesion on an endoscope camera flow in real time to provide an augmented reality application.","1849-2266","978-1-7281-3140-5","10.1109/ISPA.2019.8868446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8868446","segmentation;uterus;augmented reality;laparoscopy","Image segmentation;Ultrasonic imaging;Augmented reality;Surgery;Signal processing algorithms;Three-dimensional displays;Videos","augmented reality;biological organs;biomedical optical imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;endoscopes;feature extraction;image reconstruction;image segmentation;medical image processing;muscle;surgery;tumours","laparoscopy videos;ultrasound image segmentation;surgical removal;fibroids;uterine myomas;endoscopic surgery;tumors;deep tissues;video stream;endoscopic camera;human surgery;ultrasound image acquisition;image quality;3D ultrasound imaging device;laparoscopic surgery;uterus boundary;endoscope camera flow;augmented reality;MRI;Otsu's thresholding","","","","12","","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One ultrasound parameter that has shown promise is the speed-of-sound (SOS) as it has been correlated experimentally to bone strength. Unfortunately, to date, a complete mechanical understanding of these findings is still missing. The aim of this study was therefore to look into the direction dependency of SOS, and the possibility to predict the microstructure starting from SOS. Fifteen human trabecular bone samples (4times4times4 mm3) from the lumbar spine were acquired; the samples had been scanned using micro-CT (resolution 14 micron) in order to obtain the 3D representation of their trabecular bone architecture. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were subsequently performed on all samples using a finite element (FE) approach (ANSYS, Inc) based on the general equations of motion. As such, SOS could be estimated. Additionally, the apparent elastic modulus ES was calculated directly from the FE model. All simulations were performed at a frequency of 1 MHz in the three main directions of the bone sample (resulting in 45 simulations): anterior-posterior (AP), medio-lateral (ML) and cranio-caudal (CC). Two groups can be distinguished when the relationship between ES and SOS is studied. The first group contains the measurements in the CC direction. They display high velocity values and a wide range of elastic moduli. The calculations in the transverse directions (AP and ML) are situated in the second group. This group is characterized by low values of the structural elastic moduli and a wide range of velocities. The direction dependency of these results could be understood by a simple model of trabecular bone. For the lumbar spine, this simple model has main trabeculae in the CC direction and smaller struts, arranged randomly connecting the main trabeculae, in the AP and ML direction. The simulated velocity is the velocity of the fastest wave through the bone sample, i.e., the wave that covers the shortest distance through the trabeculae. From these results can be concluded that ultrasonic wave propagation is direction dependent and this dependency can help in the characterization of the strength of the trabecular bone.","1051-0117","978-1-4244-2428-3","10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4803568","Ultrasound;finite element method;osteoporosis;simulation","Cancellous bone;Ultrasonic imaging;Spine;Osteoporosis;Microstructure;Humans;Numerical simulation;Finite element methods;Equations;Frequency","bioacoustics;biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;bone;computerised tomography;diseases;elastic moduli;finite element analysis;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;ultrasonic propagation","microstructural simulation;ultrasonic wave propagation;vertebral bone sample;diagnostic screening tool;osteoporosis;bone strength;trabecular bone sample;microCT;three-dimensional numerical simulation;finite element approach;equation-of-motion;elastic modulus estimation;CC direction measurement;transverse direction;lumbar spine;3D representation;frequency 1 MHz","","1","","12","","21 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past twenty five years, LiDAR scanning has emerged as a fascinating technology that allows for the rapid acquisition of three dimensional data of real world environments while new virtual reality (VR) technology allows users to experience simulated environments. However, combining these two technologies can be difficult as previous approaches to interactively rendering large point clouds have generally created a trade-off between interactivity and quality. For instance, many techniques used in commercially available software have utilized methods to sub-sample data during interaction, only showing a high-quality render when the viewpoint is kept static. Unfortunately, for displays in which viewpoints are rarely static, such as virtual reality systems, these methods are not useful. This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of quality-interactivity trade-off through a progressive feedback-driven rendering algorithm. This technique uses reprojections of past views to accelerate the reconstruction of the current view and can be used to extend existing point cloud viewing algorithms. The presented method is tested against previous methods, demonstrating marked improvements in both rendering quality and interactivity. This algorithm and rendering application could serve as a tool to enable virtual rehabilitation within 3D models of one's own home from a remote location.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007521","","Rendering (computer graphics);Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Graphics processing units;Virtual reality;Hardware;Solid modeling","data acquisition;medical computing;virtual reality","home environments;self-management role;LiDAR scanning;three dimensional data acquisition;virtual reality;high-quality render;progressive feedback-driven rendering algorithm;virtual rehabilitation;3D models;cloud viewing algorithms","","","","34","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, previous methods have a high computational complexity and are not robust for 3D point cloud with low precision. Thus, a projection-based registration is presented. First, depth are refined based on temporal property by excluding 3D points with a large variation, and spatial property by filling holes referring neighboring 3D points. Second, 3D point clouds acquired at two views are projected onto the same image plane, and two-step integer mapping enables the modified KLT to find correspondences. Then, fine registration is carried out by minimizing distance errors. Finally, a final color is evaluated using colors of corresponding points and an indoor environment is reconstructed by applying the above procedure to consecutive scenes. The proposed method reduces computational complexity by searching for correspondences within an image plane. It not only enables an effective registration even for 3D point cloud with low precision, but also need only a few views. The generated model can be adopted for interaction with as well as navigation in a virtual environment.","1550-6185","0-7695-2327-7","10.1109/3DIM.2005.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443282","","Cameras;Layout;Image reconstruction;Clouds;Indoor environments;Computational complexity;Robustness;Filling;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Navigation","virtual reality;image reconstruction;image registration;cameras;computational complexity","projection-based image registration;multiview camera;indoor scene reconstruction;computational complexity;3D point cloud;distance error minimization;virtual environment","","1","","14","","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we describe a discrete-time dynamic system to model spin dynamics, and derive an estimation-theoretic bound, i.e., the Cramér-Rao bound, to characterize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency of an MR fingerprinting experiment. We then formulate an optimal experiment design problem, which determines a sequence of acquisition parameters to encode MR tissue parameters with the maximal SNR efficiency, while respecting the physical constraints and other constraints from the image decoding/reconstruction process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo experiments. We demonstrate that the optimized experiments substantially reduce data acquisition time and/or improve parameter estimation. For example, the optimized experiments achieve about a factor of two improvement in the accuracy of T2 maps, while keeping similar or slightly better accuracy of T1 maps. Finally, as a remarkable observation, we find that the sequence of optimized acquisition parameters appears to be highly structured rather than randomly/pseudo-randomly varying as is prescribed in the conventional MR fingerprinting experiments.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2018.2873704","National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481484","Optimal experiment design;Cramér-Rao bound;spin dynamics;system identification;statistical inference;quantitative imaging","Magnetization;Mathematical model;Signal to noise ratio;Biomedical imaging;Image reconstruction;Maximum likelihood decoding","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;data acquisition;image reconstruction;medical image processing;parameter estimation;phantoms","Cramér-Rao bound meets spin dynamics;magnetic resonance fingerprinting;quantitative imaging paradigm;multiple MR tissue parameter maps;single experiment;estimation-theoretic framework;discrete-time dynamic system;signal-to-noise ratio efficiency;MR fingerprinting experiment;optimal experiment design problem;MR tissue parameters;maximal SNR efficiency;image decoding/reconstruction process;phantom experiments;optimized experiments;data acquisition time;parameter estimation;optimized acquisition parameters;conventional MR fingerprinting experiments;in vivo experiments","Brain;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Likelihood Functions;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Signal-To-Noise Ratio","3","","69","","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The platform robustness has been evaluated with respect to input variable variations, but for any clinical implementation model flow validation is essential. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the patient-specific CFD model against multimodal image-based flow measurements. For the validation, 4D echocardiography was acquired from two healthy subjects, from which LV velocity fields were simulated. In-vivo flows from the same two subjects were then acquired by pulsed wave (PW) Doppler imaging over both LV-valves, and by cine phase-contract magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) at eight defined anatomical planes in the LV. By fusing PC-MRI and the ultrasound acquisitions using a three-chamber alignment algorithm, simulated and measured flows were quantitatively compared. General flow pattern correspondence was observed, with a mean error of 1.4 cm/s and root mean square deviation of 5.7 cm/s for all measured PC-MRI LV-planes. For the PW-Doppler comparison, a mean error of 3.6 cm/s was reported. Overall, the following work represents a validation of the proposed patient-specific CFD platform, and the agreement with clinical data highlight the potential for future clinical use of the models.","1948-5727","978-1-4673-9897-8","10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728802","Computational Fluid Dynamics;CFD;Validation;4D Echocardiography;Flow Simulations;Hemodynamics;MRI","Magnetic resonance imaging;Doppler effect;Computational fluid dynamics;Computational modeling;Blood flow;Echocardiography","biomedical MRI;computational fluid dynamics;Doppler measurement;echocardiography;flow simulation;haemodynamics;image fusion;medical image processing","multimodal validation;patient-specific intraventricular flow simulations;4D echocardiography;refined medical imaging techniques;computational fluid dynamics;patient-specific CFD modelling;complex flow behavior;blood flow;left ventricle;multimodal image-based flow measurements;LV velocity fields;pulsed wave Doppler imaging;cine phase-contract magnetic resonance imaging;PC-MRI;image fusion;ultrasound acquisitions;three-chamber alignment algorithm;flow pattern correspondence;root mean square deviation;PW-Doppler comparison","","3","","16","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Safety education of citizens could be a particularly promising domain for immersive serious games, because people tend not to pay attention to and benefit from current safety materials. In this paper, we propose an HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing learning immediately after the experience but we extend our attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger. A knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover, subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we discuss in the paper.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391853","Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014255","Immersive VR;serious games;user evaluation;knowledge retention;physiological measurements;aviation safety;Immersive VR;serious games;user evaluation;knowledge retention;physiological measurements;aviation safety","Games;Safety;Aircraft;Education;Materials;Avatars;Engines","avionics;computer aided instruction;computer games;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","knowledge retention;consumer head-mounted displays;educational applications;immersive VR;gaming elements;immersive serious games;safety materials;HMD-based immersive game;aircraft emergency;aviation safety education method;airlines;safety knowledge acquisition;safety procedures;knowledge test;safety card;physiological measurements;superior retention","Accidents, Aviation;Aviation;Computer Graphics;Humans;User-Computer Interface;Video Games","99","","59","","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In conventional Fourier transform-based imaging methods, each of these images is acquired independently. As a result, the temporal resolution possible is limited by the number of data points collected for each data set, or one often was to sacrifice spatial resolution for temporal resolution. To overcome this problem, several ""data-sharing"" methods have been proposed which acquire one or more high-resolution reference images and a sequence of reduced dynamic data sets. This paper is devoted to the discussion of a generalized series-based dynamic imaging method, which is an optimal implementation of the data-sharing principle.

They are generally based on the response of static scatterers inside the imaged region. However, scatterer motion, for example in blood vessels, has an inevitable influence on multi-pulse techniques, which can either enhance or degrade the technique involved. This paper investigates the response of static nonlinear media insonated by multi-pulses with various phase shifts, and the influence of scatterer motion on multi-pulse techniques. Simulations and experimental results from a single bubble and clouds of bubbles show that the phase shift of the echoes backscattered from bubbles is dependent on the transmissions' phase shift, and that the bubble motion influences the efficiency of multi-pulse techniques: fundamental and second-harmonic amplitudes of the processed signal change periodically, exhibiting maximum or minimum values, according to scatterer motion. Furthermore, experimental results based on the second-harmonic inversion (SHI) technique reveal that bubble motion can be taken into account to regulate the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). With the optimal PRF, the CTR of SHI images can be improved by about 12 dB compared with second-harmonic images.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6604538","","Harmonic analysis;Frequency conversion;Imaging;Radio frequency;Ultrasonic imaging;Media;Power harmonic filters","biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;bubbles","ultrasound contrast imaging;scatterer motion;multipulse techniques;multiple transmissions;contrast-to-tissue ratio;blood vessels;static nonlinear media;phase shifts;bubble motion;second-harmonic inversion technique;SHI technique;pulse repetition frequency;second-harmonic images","Blood Vessels;Computer Simulation;Contrast Media;Humans;Microbubbles;Models, Biological;Motion;Phantoms, Imaging;Regional Blood Flow;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","8","","39","","20 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Researchers uses mathematical or physical models while the industry uses test vehicle or high-fidelity test rigs. However, both have a common objective: reducing the gap between the model and the reality. Accurate estimation of energy losses is necessary to provide a better estimate of the amount of energy that can be harvested and to determine project feasibility. This paper presents an off-line Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation wherein physical models and realtime data are used to estimate the kinetic energy losses in the urban driving cycle. A physical model of an drive-train of a passenger car is modeled using Bond Graph which also estimates the kinetic energy losses at the wheels. This model is further modified to include a modulated input with real-time urban driving cycle, thus forming a off-line HIL model. The real-time urban driving cycle is generated for representative road network using a passenger car fitted with a data acquisition unit. The physical model with modulated effort provides an estimate the amount of energy that can be gainfully harvested using Parallel Regenerative Braking System (PRBS). Using physical models and real data from actual vehicles in a low cost, general, off-line Hardware-in-the Loop (HIL) simulation, we show that designers can validate new automotive concepts even before prototypes become available while maintaining strict performance, quality requirements and time-to-market constraints.","","978-1-4799-3975-6","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238428","Energy Harvesting;Off-line Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation;Pneumatic drive train;Regenerative Braking;Acceleration Assist;Light Motor Vehicles","Vehicles;Wheels;Acceleration;Computational modeling;Data models;Engines;Kinetic energy","automobiles;automotive engineering;bond graphs;data acquisition;digital simulation;power transmission (mechanical);regenerative braking;traffic engineering computing;Unified Modeling Language","hardware-in-the-loop estimation;kinetic energy loss estimation;urban driving cycles;bond graph based unified modeling framework;physical models;mathematical models;high-fidelity test rigs;off-line hardware-in-the-loop simulation;off-line HIL simulation;passenger car drive-train;off-line HIL model;representative road network;data acquisition unit;parallel regenerative braking system;PRBS;time-to-market constraints;automotive concepts;quality requirements","","","","19","","7 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This visual grammar constitutes a reference based on which designers may then build projects whose narrative and/or emotional content captivates the end-user. The research presented starts from an artistic approach through design and derives generic principles. The starting point is the development of actual AR installations and their presentation to the general public in the form of an evolving exhibition entitled Give Me More.

The analysis process generally takes the form of a qualitative and discrete simulation process that answers various 'what-if' questions. The input to the qualitative simulation is a logically complete set of guidewords, such as 'more flow', 'less flow', 'more temperature' etc. The results of the simulation are used to determine all possible states of plant units thereby helping to find the potential hazards.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=182419","","Simulation;Manufacturing automation;Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge based systems;Process control;Safety","digital simulation;factory automation;knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;process control;safety","hazard analysis;digital simulation;knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;intelligent simulation architecture;operability analysis;large-scale process plant;knowledge-based simulation;HAZOP;safety analysis","","4","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"
"Interactive Motion Recovery of Chinese Kung-Fu for Computer Games","H. Yi","Wuhan Polytech., Wuhan, China","2013 International Conference on Computer Sciences and Applications","19 Jun 2014","2013","","","402","405","As a kind of Chinese culture, Chinese Kung-fu has been very popular in movies and TV programs and attracted the interest of people all over the world. The paper address the problem to recover Chinese Kung-fu from video sequence for further use in computer games. Human motion capture for animation and VR has reached a level of capturing real motion data from people using various visual and non-visual sensors. However, most of the available systems require special devices and environment, or even attach extra things onto an actor. To realize a personal system, this paper developed a general software to acquire arbitrary motion from a video sequence. A general 3D articulate human model with changeable size, color and surface shape is prepared. This model is then driven either automatically or manually to match with the moving body in the consecutive image frames. This matching starts from key frames that contain key poses. A specific orientation interpolation is used to get the motion status in in-between frames and finally a smooth motion is obtained. This approach is suitable for personal use to meet wide needs of human motion acquisition.","","978-0-7695-5125-8","10.1109/CSA.2013.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835628","Video Sequences;Human motion capture;Chinese Kung-fu;Computer Games;Key Frames","Interpolation;Solid modeling;Video sequences;Biological system modeling;Quaternions;Computers;Three-dimensional displays","computer games;image motion analysis;image sequences;solid modelling;video signal processing","interactive motion recovery;Chinese Kung Fu;computer games;Chinese culture;video sequence;human motion capture;animation;VR;virtual reality;visual sensors;nonvisual sensors;general 3D articulate human model;image frames;smooth motion;human motion acquisition","","","","6","","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We view the problem of hypotheses formation for classification as a search problem. Whereas previous research acquiring classification knowledge have used a deterministic bias for forming generalizations, we use a more random bias for taking inductive leaps. We re-formulate the supervised classification problem as a function optimization problem, the goal of which is to search for a hypotheses that minimizes the number of incorrect classifications of training instances. We use a simulated annealing based classifier (SAC) to optimize the hypotheses used for classification. The particular variation of simulated annealing algorithm that we have used is known as Very Fast Simulated Re-annealing (VFSR). We use a batch-incremental mode of learning to compare SAC with a genetic algorithm based classifier, GABIL, and a traditional incremental machine learning algorithm, ID5R. By using a set of artificial target concepts, we show that SAC performs better on more complex target concepts.<>","","0-8186-6785-0","10.1109/TAI.1994.346392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=346392","","Simulated annealing;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Industrial training;Computational modeling;Business;Stochastic processes","search problems;learning (artificial intelligence);knowledge acquisition;generalisation (artificial intelligence);simulated annealing;classification;genetic algorithms","simulated annealing based classification;attribute based classification;machine learning research;hypotheses formation;search problem;classification knowledge;deterministic bias;generalizations;random bias;inductive leaps;supervised classification problem;function optimization problem;incorrect classifications;training instances;simulated annealing algorithm;Very Fast Simulated Reannealing;batch-incremental mode;SAC;genetic algorithm based classifier;GABIL;incremental machine learning algorithm;ID5R","","2","","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system will enable unprecedented spatiotemporal control of the TMS-induced electric fields (E-fields) with simultaneous rapid whole-head MRI acquisition to record the brain activity. A critical design question is how TMS coil elements interact with the transmit field (B1+) of the volume coil integrated in 3T MRI systems. In general, the TMS coils are not designed to have any resonant characteristics at the MRI frequency, they may potentially disturb the RF field due to the eddy currents induced. This is especially a concern with a multichannel TMS setup where the subject's head will be largely covered with the stimulation coils. Therefore, we investigated this problem by computational simulations with realistic TMS coil geometries and a birdcage transmit coil in conjunction with a human body model. We compared the B1+ interaction effects of a commercially available MR-compatible TMS coil with our coil prototype. In both cases, the results show small local changes in the transmit field B1+ of the birdcage coil. Maximal Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values over 1g tissue were found to be slightly lower when the TMS elements were present. We conclude that it should be feasible and safe to use the conventional body transmit coil even when an array of TMS coils is used.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513208","","Phantoms;Radio frequency;Magnetic resonance imaging;Head;Standards;Magnetic heads","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;brain;coils;medical image processing;radiation therapy;transcranial magnetic stimulation","birdcage coil B;human body model;integrated multichannel Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator;Magnetic Resonance Imaging system;TMS-induced electric fields;whole-head MRI acquisition;volume coil;MRI frequency;RF field;multichannel TMS setup;birdcage transmit coil;MR-compatible TMS coil;coil prototype;MRI systems;body transmit coil;TMS coil geometries;multichannel TMS-MRI head coil array;specific absorption rate;brain activity","","","","10","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are still some problems. Along with the improvement of hydrological telemetering systems, more and more data could be acquired. The inconsistencies in data, as well as bulk information processing would intensify the pressure of clients noticeably. Besides, water resources information systems are usually not intuitionistic enough, and it is difficult for users to recognize underlying surface features comprehensively. This paper explored the integration of data warehouse (DW), virtual reality (VR) and GIS in water resources information system to solve the problems mentioned above, while Yinzhou District, located in Ningbo, Eastern China, was selected as the research area to develop the system. Firstly, DW was built in this system to integrate hydrological data from ultra-short wave (USW) telemetering system with those from general packet radio service (GPRS) telemetering system, providing the system with desirable data without massive calculation in clients. Secondly, remote sensing image was utilized as the base map of the system, which was also used for three-dimensional animations generation so that watershed characteristics could be demonstrated more intuitively. Finally, with the help of GIS, water resources information system was developed which could meet diverse practical requirements of water conservancy management.","","978-1-4244-8351-8","10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5969095","Water resources information system;data warehouse;virtual reality;geographical information system;integration","Water resources;Geographic Information Systems;Water conservation;Databases;Animation;Data warehouses","computer animation;data warehouses;environmental management;geographic information systems;geophysics computing;hydrology;remote sensing;telemetry;virtual reality;water resources","data warehouse;virtual reality;geographical information system;water resources management;GIS;water resources information system;water conservancy management;hydrological telemetering system;Yinzhou District;hydrological data;ultra-short wave telemetering system;USW telemetering system;general packet radio service;GPRS telemetering system;remote sensing image;three-dimensional animation","","1","","18","","1 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although fine and isotropic cross-sectional images can be obtained by using the most advanced MRI facilities, sparse sampling is commonly performed in the clinical examination. Intensive feasibility study was performed with three regular grid volume data sets, whose sources include an analytic function; a numerical simulation; and measurements. In either case, the Voxel Stuffing algorithm generates a higher-quality volume data from triple sequences of cross-sectional images in comparison with any volume data reconstructed linearly from a single sequence of class-sectional images. The Voxel Stuffing algorithm is extended to reconstruct a rectilinearly structured volume data set from triple non-orthogonal sequences of cross-sectional images, which are taken commonly in the general MRI clinical examination. The effectiveness of the extended Voxel Stuffing algorithm is illustrated with an MRI data set for a human brain containing a tumor.","","0-7695-1113-9","10.1109/MIAR.2001.930293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930293","","Interpolation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image reconstruction;Image sampling;Performance evaluation;Magnetic analysis;Performance analysis;Numerical simulation;Volume measurement;Humans","medical image processing;biomedical MRI;interpolation;image sequences;image reconstruction;brain;tumours","Voxel Stuffing algorithm;high-quality volume interpolation;cross-sectional image sequences;image reconstruction;high-quality volume data;magnetic resonance imaging;MRI;sparse sampling;grid volume data sets;analytic function;numerical simulation;measurements;human brain;tumor;medical image processing;volume modeling","","","","4","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since such vision-based human motion capturing systems are essentially unstable and can only acquire partial information because of self-occlusion, we have to introduce a robust pose estimation strategy, or an appropriate human motion synthesis based on motion filtering.

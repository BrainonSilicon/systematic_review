*Virtual Reality","INTRODUCTION: Simulation-integrated tutoring in virtual reality (VR) simulation training by green lighting is a common learning support in simulation-based temporal bone surgical training. However, tutoring overreliance can negatively affect learning. We therefore wanted to investigate the effects of simulator-integrated tutoring on performance and learning.

METHODS: A prospective, educational cohort study of a learning intervention (simulator-integrated tutoring) during repeated and distributed VR simulation training for directed, self-regulated learning of the mastoidectomy procedure. Two cohorts of novices (medical students) were recruited: 16 participants were trained using the intervention program (intermittent simulator-integrated tutoring) and 14 participants constituted a nontutored reference cohort. Outcomes were final-product performance assessed by 2 blinded raters and simulator-recorded metrics.

RESULTS: Simulator-integrated tutoring had a large and positive effect on the final-product performance while turned on (mean difference = 3.8 points, P < 0.0001). However, this did not translate to a better final-product performance in subsequent nontutored procedures. The tutored cohort had a better metrics-based score, reflecting higher efficiency of drilling (mean difference = 3.6%, P = 0.001). For the individual metrics, simulator-integrated tutoring had mixed effects both during procedures and on the tutored cohort in general (learning effect).

CONCLUSIONS: Simulator-integrated tutoring by green lighting did not induce a better final-product performance but increased efficiency. The mixed effects on learning could be caused by tutoring overreliance, resulting from a lack of cognitive engagement when the tutor function is on. Further learning strategies such as feedback should be explored to support novice learning and cognitive engagement.",,1559-713X,1559-2332,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0000000000000414,Journal Article,"10.1097/SIH.0000000000000414 [doi]

Virtual Reality","Importance: Video learning prior to surgery is common practice for trainees and surgeons, and immersive virtual reality (IVR) simulators are of increasing interest for surgical training. The training effectiveness of IVR compared with video training in complex skill acquisition should be studied.

Objectives: To evaluate whether IVR improves learning effectiveness for surgical trainees and to validate a VR rating scale through correlation to real-world performance.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This block randomized, intervention-controlled clinical trial included senior (ie, postgraduate year 4 and 5) orthopedic surgery residents from multiple institutions in Canada during a single training course. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Data were collected from January 30 to February 1, 2020.

Intervention: An IVR training platform providing a case-based module for reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) for advanced rotator cuff tear arthropathy. Participants were permitted to repeat the module indefinitely.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was a validated performance metric for both the intervention and control groups (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills [OSATS]). Secondary measures included transfer of training (ToT), transfer effectiveness ratio (TER), and cost-effectiveness (CER) ratios of IVR training compared with control. Additional secondary measures included IVR performance metrics measured on a novel rating scale compared with real-world performance.

Results: A total of 18 senior surgical residents participated; 9 (50%) were randomized to the IVR group and 9 (50%) to the control group. Participant demographic characteristics were not different for age (mean [SD] age: IVR group, 31.1 [2.8] years; control group, 31.0 [2.7] years), gender (IVR group, 8 [89%] men; control group, 6 [67%] men), surgical experience (mean [SD] experience with RSA: IVR group, 3.3 [0.9]; control group, 3.2 [0.4]), or prior simulator use (had experience: IVR group 6 [67%]; control group, 4 [44%]). The IVR group completed training 387% faster considering a single repetition (mean [SD] time for IVR group: 4.1 [2.5] minutes; mean [SD] time for control group: 16.1 [2.6] minutes; difference, 12.0 minutes; 95% CI, 8.8-14.0 minutes; P < .001). The IVR group had significantly better mean (SD) OSATS scores than the control group (15.9 [2.5] vs 9.4 [3.2]; difference, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.3-9.7; P < .001). The IVR group also demonstrated higher mean (SD) verbal questioning scores (4.1 [1.0] vs 2.2 [1.7]; difference, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.1-3.3; P = .03). The IVR score (ie, Precision Score) had a strong correlation to real-world OSATS scores (r = 0.74) and final implant position (r = 0.73). The ToT was 59.4%, based on the OSATS score. The TER was 0.79, and the system was 34 times more cost-effective than control, based on CER.

Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, surgical training with IVR demonstrated superior learning efficiency, knowledge, and skill transfer. The TER of 0.79 substituted for 47.4 minutes of operating room time when IVR was used for 60 minutes.

The aims of this study were to determine (1) if a VR curriculum for training residents to perform anterior approach total hip replacement (AA-THR) was feasible, (2) if VR enabled residents' performance to be measured objectively, and (3) if cognitive and motor skills that were learned with use of VR were transferred to the physical world.

METHODS: The performance of 32 orthopaedic residents (surgical postgraduate years [PGY]-1 through 4) with no prior experience with AA-THR was measured during 5 consecutive VR training and assessment sessions. Outcome measures were related to procedural sequence, efficiency of movement, duration of surgery, and visuospatial precision in acetabular component positioning and femoral neck osteotomy, and were compared with the performance of 4 expert hip surgeons to establish competency-based criteria. Pretraining and post-training assessments on dry bone models were used to assess the transfer of visuospatial skills from VR to the physical world.

RESULTS: Residents progressively developed surgical skills in VR on a learning curve through repeated practice, plateauing, on average, after 4 sessions (4.1 +/- 0.6 hours); they reached expert VR levels for 9 of 10 metrics (except femoral osteotomy angle). Procedural errors were reduced by 79%, assistive prompts were reduced by 70%, and procedural duration was reduced by 28%. Dominant and nondominant hand movements were reduced by 35% and 36%, respectively, and head movement was reduced by 44%. Femoral osteotomy was performed more accurately, and acetabular implant orientation improved in VR assessments. In the physical world assessments, experts were more accurate than residents prior to simulation, but were matched by residents after simulation for all of the metrics except femoral osteotomy angle. The residents who performed best in VR were the most accurate in the physical world, while 2 residents were unable to achieve competence despite sustained practice.

CONCLUSIONS: For novice surgeons learning AA-THR skills, fully immersive VR technology can objectively measure progress in the acquisition of surgical skills as measured by procedural sequence, efficiency of movement, and visuospatial accuracy. Skills learned in this environment are transferred to the physical environment.",,1535-1386,0021-9355,https://dx.doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.19.00629,Journal Article,"10.2106/JBJS.19.00629 [doi]

*Virtual Reality","AIMS: Arthroplasty skills need to be acquired safely during training, yet operative experience is increasingly hard to acquire by trainees. Virtual reality (VR) training using headsets and motion-tracked controllers can simulate complex open procedures in a fully immersive operating theatre. The present study aimed to determine if trainees trained using VR perform better than those using conventional preparation for performing total hip arthroplasty (THA).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 24 surgical trainees (seven female, 17 male; mean age 29 years (28 to 31)) volunteered to participate in this observer-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled trial. They had no prior experience of anterior approach THA. Of these 24 trainees, 12 completed a six-week VR training programme in a simulation laboratory, while the other 12 received only conventional preparatory materials for learning THA. All trainees then performed a cadaveric THA, assessed independently by two hip surgeons. The primary outcome was technical and non-technical surgical performance measured by a THA-specific procedure-based assessment (PBA). Secondary outcomes were step completion measured by a task-specific checklist, error in acetabular component orientation, and procedure duration.

RESULTS: VR-trained surgeons performed at a higher level than controls, with a median PBA of Level 3a (procedure performed with minimal guidance or intervention) versus Level 2a (guidance required for most/all of the procedure or part performed). VR-trained surgeons completed 33% more key steps than controls (mean 22 (sd 3) vs 12 (sd 3)), were 12degree more accurate in component orientation (mean error 4degree (sd 6degree) vs 16degree (sd 17degree)), and were 18% faster (mean 42 minutes (sd 7) vs 51 minutes (sd 9)).

CONCLUSION: Procedural knowledge and psychomotor skills for THA learned in VR were transferred to cadaveric performance. Basic preparatory materials had limited value for trainees learning a new technique. VR training advanced trainees further up the learning curve, enabling highly precise component orientation and more efficient surgery. VR could augment traditional surgical training to improve how surgeons learn complex open procedures.

Virtual Reality","INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of skills between various levels of force feedback (FFB) using the Simodont dental trainer (Moog, Nieuw-Vennep, the Netherlands). Students practiced a manual dexterity exercise in a virtual reality environment at a standard level of FFB and then were tested at the standard and an altered level of FFB. In addition, the students' satisfaction with the training exercise was evaluated.

METHODS: One hundred twenty-six first-year dental students were randomly distributed into four groups and underwent a manual dexterity test in the virtual reality environment with automatic assessment after a 3-month period of practicing with standard FFB. The test consisted of drilling with the standard FFB and an altered level of FFB to evaluate the effect on performance. After the test, the participants completed a questionnaire.

RESULTS: The results showed that 74% of the students who passed completed between one of three and three of three successful attempts at FFB levels at which they had not previously practiced.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study imply that if students practice a sufficient amount of time at one level of FFB, a skill is transferable from one level of FFB to another.",,1559-713X,1559-2332,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0000000000000370,Journal Article,10.1097/SIH.0000000000000370 [doi],ppublish,English,,2019 Jun,5/23/19 6:00,01/03/2020 06:00,5/23/19 6:00,2019,20200102,20200102,20201215,Click here for full text options,SFX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*Virtual Reality","BACKGROUND: Endoscopy has traditionally been taught with novices practicing on real patients under the supervision of experienced endoscopists. Recently, the growing awareness of the need for patient safety has brought simulation training to the forefront. Simulation training can provide trainees with the chance to practice their skills in a learner-centred, risk-free environment. It is important to ensure that skills gained through simulation positively transfer to the clinical environment. This updated review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation training in gastrointestinal endoscopy.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether virtual reality simulation training can supplement and/or replace early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following health professions, educational, and computer databases until 12 July 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, AMED, ERIC, Education Full Text, CBCA Education, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Abstracts in New Technology and Engineering, Computer and Information Systems Abstracts, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. We also searched the grey literature until November 2017.

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing VR endoscopy simulation training versus any other method of endoscopy training with outcomes measured on humans in the clinical setting, including conventional patient-based training, training using another form of endoscopy simulation, or no training. We also included trials comparing two different methods of VR training.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials, and extracted data on the trial characteristics and outcomes. We pooled data for meta-analysis where participant groups were similar, studies assessed the same intervention and comparator, and had similar definitions of outcome measures. We calculated risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes when studies reported the same or different outcome measures, respectively. We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.

MAIN RESULTS: We included 18 trials (421 participants; 3817 endoscopic procedures). We judged three trials as at low risk of bias. Ten trials compared VR training with no training, five trials with conventional endoscopy training, one trial with another form of endoscopy simulation training, and two trials compared two different methods of VR training. Due to substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity across our four comparisons, we did not perform a meta-analysis for several outcomes. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, low, or very low due to risk of bias, imprecision, and heterogeneity.Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus no training: There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect on composite score of competency (MD 3.10, 95% CI -0.16 to 6.36; 1 trial, 24 procedures; low-quality evidence). Composite score of competency was based on 5-point Likert scales assessing seven domains: atraumatic technique, colonoscope advancement, use of instrument controls, flow of procedure, use of assistants, knowledge of specific procedure, and overall performance. Scoring range was from 7 to 35, a higher score representing a higher level of competence. Virtual reality training compared to no training likely provides participants with some benefit, as measured by independent procedure completion (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.26; 6 trials, 815 procedures; moderate-quality evidence). We evaluated overall rating of performance (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75; 1 trial, 18 procedures), visualisation of mucosa (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.00; 1 trial, 55 procedures), performance time (MD -0.20 minutes, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.30; 2 trials, 29 procedures), and patient discomfort (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.35; 2 trials, 145 procedures), all with very low-quality evidence. No trials reported procedure-related complications or critical flaws (e.g. bleeding, luminal perforation) (3 trials, 550 procedures; moderate-quality evidence). Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus conventional patient-based training: One trial reported composite score of competency but did not provide sufficient data for quantitative analysis. Virtual reality training compared to conventional patient-based training resulted in fewer independent procedure completions (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; 2 trials, 174 procedures; low-quality evidence). We evaluated performance time (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.80; 2 trials, 34 procedures), overall rating of performance (MD -0.90, 95% CI -4.40 to 2.60; 1 trial, 16 procedures), and visualisation of mucosa (MD 0.0, 95% CI -6.02 to 6.02; 1 trial, 18 procedures), all with very low-quality evidence. Virtual reality training in combination with conventional training appears to be advantageous over VR training alone. No trials reported any procedure-related complications or critical flaws (3 trials, 72 procedures; very low-quality evidence). Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus another form of endoscopy simulation: Based on one study, there were no differences between groups with respect to composite score of competency, performance time, and visualisation of mucosa. Virtual reality training in combination with another form of endoscopy simulation training did not appear to confer any benefit compared to VR training alone.Two methods of virtual reality training: Based on one study, a structured VR simulation-based training curriculum compared to self regulated learning on a VR simulator appears to provide benefit with respect to a composite score evaluating competency. Based on another study, a progressive-learning curriculum that sequentially increases task difficulty provides benefit with respect to a composite score of competency over the structured VR training curriculum.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: VR simulation-based training can be used to supplement early conventional endoscopy training for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. However, we found insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of VR simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training. The quality of the current evidence was low due to inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment, and/or blinding of outcome assessment in several trials. Further trials are needed that are at low risk of bias, utilise outcome measures with strong evidence of validity and reliability, and examine the optimal nature and duration of training.",,1469-493X,1361-6137,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008237.pub3,"Journal Article

Walking/ed [Education]","Objective: Pedestrian injury is a leading cause of injury-related mortality for children. This pilot randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of a training program to teach where and how to cross safely.

Methods: Using fully immersive virtual reality technology, 142 children 7-10 years of age were recruited, with 130 completing crossing measures before (pretest) and immediately after (posttest) training. Training comprised 1.5 hr, was tailored to each child's performance over trials, and focused on either where to cross (n = 44 children completed testing) or how to cross safely (n = 43); corresponding control groups comprised 22 and 21 children, respectively. Following training, children in the intervention groups completed additional tasks to test conceptual knowledge and generalization of learning. Children in the control groups spent the same time as those in training groups but played a video game that used the same game controller but provided no training in street crossing.

Results: The primary outcomes were errors in crossing at posttest, controlling for pretest error scores. Children in the intervention group made from 75% to 98% fewer errors at posttest than control children for all pedestrian safety variables related to where and how to cross safely, with effect sizes (incidence rate ratios) varying between 0.02 and 0.25. They also showed a generalization of what they had learned and applied this knowledge to novel posttraining situations.

Conclusion: Training within a virtual pedestrian environment can successfully improve children's conceptual understanding and crossing behaviors for both where and how to cross streets safely.",Curated,1465-735X,0146-8693,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsy056,"Journal Article

Young Adult","OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess whether computerized attentional training improves dual-tasking abilities in older adults and whether its effect and transfer are modulated by age and the type of training provided. This study also used virtual reality (VR) as a proxy to measure transfer in a real life related context.

METHOD: Sixty participants (30 older and 30 younger adults) were randomized to either: (a) single-task training (two tasks practiced in focused attention; visual detection and alphanumeric equation task); or (b) divided attention variable-priority training (varying the amount of attention to put on each task when performed concurrently). Training effects were assessed at pre- and post-training with tasks similar to the one used in training. Transfer was measured with the virtual car ride, an immersive dual-task scenario and a self-reported questionnaire.

RESULTS: In older adults, variable-priority improved attentional control abilities and led to better transfer in the VR dual-task scenario compared with single-task. Younger adults benefited equally from the two types of training and transfer was found on the Alpha span task when performed concurrently in VR. Single-task improved the ability of all participants to carry out the tasks in the focused attention condition. No transfer effects were found on the self-reported measure for either training type or age.

CONCLUSION: Attention remains plastic in old age and programs designed to improve attentional control might be beneficial to older adults. Importantly, training can produce transfer to more real life related tasks and transfer remains possible throughout the life span.

Phantom heads provide an efficient way to teach preclinical students dental procedures safely while increasing their dexterity skills considerably. Modern computerized phantom head training units incorporate features of virtual reality technology and the ability to offer concurrent augmented feedback. The aims of this review were to examine and evaluate the dental literature for evidence supporting their use and to discuss the role of augmented feedback versus the facilitator's instruction. Adjunctive training in these units seems to enhance student's learning and skill acquisition and reduce the required faculty supervision time. However, the virtual augmented feedback cannot be used as the sole method of feedback, and the facilitator's input is still critical. Well-powered longitudinal randomized trials exploring the impact of these units on student's clinical performance and issues of cost-effectiveness are warranted.",,1559-713X,1559-2332,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0000000000000250,"Journal Article

Young Adult","BACKGROUND: Work-hour restrictions as set forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and other governing bodies have forced training programs to seek out new learning tools to accelerate acquisition of both medical skills and knowledge. As a result, competency-based training has become an important part of residency training. The purpose of this study was to directly compare arthroscopic skill acquisition in both high-fidelity and low-fidelity simulator models and to assess skill transfer from either modality to a cadaveric specimen, simulating intraoperative conditions.

METHODS: Forty surgical novices (pre-clerkship-level medical students) voluntarily participated in this trial. Baseline demographic data, as well as data on arthroscopic knowledge and skill, were collected prior to training. Subjects were randomized to 5-week independent training sessions on a high-fidelity virtual reality arthroscopic simulator or on a bench-top arthroscopic setup, or to an untrained control group. Post-training, subjects were asked to perform a diagnostic arthroscopy on both simulators and in a simulated intraoperative environment on a cadaveric knee. A more difficult surprise task was also incorporated to evaluate skill transfer. Subjects were evaluated using the Global Rating Scale (GRS), the 14-point arthroscopic checklist, and a timer to determine procedural efficiency (time per task). Secondary outcomes focused on objective measures of virtual reality simulator motion analysis.

RESULTS: Trainees on both simulators demonstrated a significant improvement (p < 0.05) in arthroscopic skills compared with baseline scores and untrained controls, both in and ex vivo. The virtual reality simulation group consistently outperformed the bench-top model group in the diagnostic arthroscopy crossover tests and in the simulated cadaveric setup. Furthermore, the virtual reality group demonstrated superior skill transfer in the surprise skill transfer task.

CONCLUSIONS: Both high-fidelity and low-fidelity simulation trainings were effective in arthroscopic skill acquisition. High-fidelity virtual reality simulation was superior to bench-top simulation in the acquisition of arthroscopic skills, both in the laboratory and in vivo. Further clinical investigation is needed to interpret the importance of these results.",,1535-1386,0021-9355,https://dx.doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.16.00324,"Comparative Study

Young Adult","This study compared virtual reality (VR) training with low cost-blended learning (BL) in a structured training program.Training of laparoscopic skills outside the operating room is mandatory to reduce operative times and risks.Laparoscopy-naive medical students were randomized in 2 groups stratified for sex. The BL group (n = 42) used E-learning for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and practiced basic skills with box trainers. The VR group (n = 42) trained basic skills and LC on the LAP Mentor II (Simbionix, Cleveland, OH). Each group trained 3 x 4 hours followed by a knowledge test concerning LC. Blinded raters assessed the operative performance of cadaveric porcine LC using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS). The LC was discontinued when it was not completed within 80 min. Students evaluated their training modality with questionnaires. The VR group completed the LC significantly faster and more often within 80 min than BL (45% v 21%, P = .02). The BL group scored higher than the VR group in the knowledge test (13.3 +/- 1.3 vs 11.0 +/- 1.7, P < 0.001). Both groups showed equal operative performance of LC in the OSATS score (49.4 +/- 10.5 vs 49.7 +/- 12.0, P = 0.90). Students generally liked training and felt well prepared for assisting in laparoscopic surgery. The efficiency of the training was judged higher by the VR group than by the BL group.VR and BL can both be applied for training the basics of LC. Multimodality training programs should be developed that combine the advantages of both approaches.",,1536-5964,0025-7974,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000000764,"Journal Article

Texas","INTRODUCTION: Surgical residents have learned flexible endoscopy by practicing on patients in hospital settings under the strict guidance of experienced surgeons. Simulation is often used to ""pretrain"" novices on endoscopic skills before real clinical practice; nonetheless, the optimal method of training remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare endoscopic virtual reality and physical model simulators and their respective roles in transferring skills to the clinical environment.

METHODS: At the beginning of a skills development rotation, 27 surgical postgraduate year 1 residents performed a baseline screening colonoscopy on a real patient under faculty supervision. Their performances were scored using the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills (GAGES). Subsequently, interns completed a 3-week flexible endoscopy curriculum developed at our institution. One-third of the residents were assigned to train with the GI Mentor simulator, one-third trained with the Kyoto simulator, and one-third of the residents trained using both simulators. At the end of their rotations, each postgraduate year 1 resident performed one posttest colonoscopy on a different patient and was again scored using GAGES by an experienced faculty.

RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in the GAGES total score (p < 0.001) and on each of its subcomponents (p = 0.001) was observed from pretest to posttest for all groups combined. Subgroup analysis indicated that trainees in the GI Mentor or both simulators conditions showed significant improvement from pretest to posttest in terms of GAGES total score (p = 0.017 vs 0.024, respectively). This was not observed for those exclusively using the Kyoto platform (p = 0.072). Nonetheless, no single training condition was shown to be a better training modality when compared to others in terms of total GAGES score or in any of its subcomponents.

CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy simulator training with the GI Mentor platform exclusively or in combination with a physical model simulator improves skill performance in real colonoscopy cases when measured with the GAGES tool.

United Kingdom","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an entire hospital simulation in imparting skills to expert healthcare providers, encompassing both retention and transfer to clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Studies demonstrating the effectiveness of simulation do not concentrate upon expert multidisciplinary teams. Moreover, their focus is confined to a single clinical setting, thereby not considering the complex interactions across multiple hospital departments.

METHODS: A total of 288 participants (Attending surgeons, anesthesiologists, physicians, and nurses) completed this largest simulation study to date, set in the UK Defence Medical Services' Hospital Simulator and the conflict zone in Afghanistan. The simulator termed ""Hospital Exercise"" (HOSPEX) is a fully immersive live-in simulation experience that covers the entire environment of a military hospital with all departments. Participants undertook a 3-day training program within HOSPEX before deployment to war zones. Primary outcome measures were assessed with IMPAcT (the Imperial Military Personnel Assessment Tool). IMPAcT measures crisis management, trauma care, hospital environment, operational readiness, and transfer of skills to civilian practice. Reliability, skills learning, and retention in the conflict zone were assessed statistically.

RESULTS: Reliability in skills assessment was excellent (Cronbach alpha: nontechnical skills = 0.87-0.94; environment/patient skills = 0.83-0.95). Pre/post-HOSPEX comparisons revealed significant improvements in decision making (M = 4.98, SD = 1.20 to M = 5.39, SD = 0.91; P = 0.03), situational awareness (M = 5.44, SD = 1.04 to M = 5.74, SD = 0.92; P = 0.01), trauma care (M = 5.53, SD = 1.23 to M = 5.85, SD = 1.09; P = 0.05), and knowledge of hospital environment (M = 5.19, SD = 1.17 to M = 5.42, SD = 0.97; P = 0.04). No skills decayed over time when assessed several months later in the real conflict zone. All skills transferred to civilian clinical practice.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the value of a full-hospital simulation across the entire patient pathway. Such macrosimulations may be the way forward for integrating the complex training needs of expert clinicians and testing organizational ""fitness for purpose"" of entire hospitals.",,1528-1140,0003-4932,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0000000000000305,"Journal Article

In this article, we report on the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of using the VR augmented cycling kit to improve cardiorespiratory (CR) fitness of individuals in the chronic phase poststroke.

METHODS: Four individuals with chronic stroke (47-65 years old and >=3 years poststroke), with residual lower extremity impairments (Fugl-Meyer 24-26/34), who were limited community ambulators (gait speed range 0.56-1.1 m/s) participated in this study. Safety was defined as the absence of adverse events. Feasibility was measured using attendance, total exercise time, and ""involvement"" measured with the presence questionnaire (PQ). Efficacy of CR fitness was evaluated using a submaximal bicycle ergometer test before and after an 8-week training program.

RESULTS: The intervention was safe and feasible with participants having 1 adverse event, 100% adherence, achieving between 90 and 125 minutes of cycling each week, and a mean PQ score of 39 (SD 3.3). There was a statistically significant (13%; P = 0.035) improvement in peak VO(2), with a range of 6% to 24.5%.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: For these individuals, poststroke, VR augmented cycling, using their heart rate to set their avatar's speed, fostered training of sufficient duration and intensity to promote CR fitness. In addition, there was a transfer of training from the bicycle to walking endurance. VR augmented cycling may be an addition to the therapist's tools for concurrent training of mobility and health promotion of individuals poststroke.",,1557-0584,1557-0576,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/NPT.0b013e3182a0a078,"Journal Article

User-Computer Interface","OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effectiveness of ToT from VR laparoscopic simulation training in 2 studies. In a second study, we also assessed the TER. ToT is a detectable performance improvement between equivalent groups, and TER is the observed percentage performance differences between 2 matched groups carrying out the same task but with 1 group pretrained on VR simulation. Concordance between simulated and in-vivo procedure performance was also assessed.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, and blinded.

PARTICIPANTS: In Study 1, experienced laparoscopic surgeons (n = 195) and in Study 2 laparoscopic novices (n = 30) were randomized to either train on VR simulation before completing an equivalent real-world task or complete the real-world task only.

RESULTS: Experienced laparoscopic surgeons and novices who trained on the simulator performed significantly better than their controls, thus demonstrating ToT. Their performance showed a TER between 7% and 42% from the virtual to the real tasks. Simulation training impacted most on procedural error reduction in both studies (32-42%). The correlation observed between the VR and real-world task performance was r > 0.96 (Study 2).

User-Computer Interface","INTRODUCTION: Virtual-reality (VR) simulation provides a safe and effective learning environment prior to practicing on patients. However, existing bronchoscopy simulators are expensive and not easily portable.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of self-directed training on a new, portable, simple simulator measured by transfer of skills to performance of more complex bronchoscopy procedures on an advanced VR simulator.

METHODS: Twenty medical students participated in the study. After a general introduction to bronchoscopy, they were randomised into two groups, receiving either self-directed bronchoscopy training using a portable, simple simulator or no manual training. Subsequently, all participants were tested on complex scenarios in an advanced VR simulator using a validated bronchoscopy quality test. Bronchoscopy quality scores were compared using independent samples t-test and correlated with a previously established pass-fail standard.

RESULTS: The intervention group spent an average of 71-min training on the new simulator. The intervention group performed significantly better than the control group, mean bronchoscopy quality score 0.55 [standard deviation (SD) 0.16] vs 0.36 (SD 0.10), P = 0.005, effect size = 1.47. Eight out of 10 participants in the intervention group passed the test compared with only 1 out of 10 in the control group.

CONCLUSION: The effect of a brief, self-directed training session using a portable, simple simulator was substantial and transferred to performance of more complex skills.

Task Performance and Analysis","BACKGROUND: Despite valuable supplemental training resources for surgical skill acquisition, utility of virtual reality simulators to improve skills relevant to performing cardiac catheterization has not been evaluated.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Post baseline cardiac catheterization performance assessment, 27 cardiology trainees were randomized to either mentored training on a virtual reality simulator (n=12) or no simulator training (control; n=15). Cardiac catheterization performance was reassessed 1 week post baseline assessment. Performance scores at 1 week were compared with baseline within each group, and change in score from baseline to 1 week was compared between groups. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess the effect of simulator training as a function of baseline performance. Technical performance improved postintervention in the simulator group (24 versus 18; P=0.008) and changed marginally in the control group (20 versus 18; P=0.054). Improvement in technical performance was greater in the simulator group (6 versus 1; P=0.04). Global performance improved postintervention in both groups (simulator, 24 versus 17, P=0.01; control, 20 versus 18, P=0.02), with a trend toward greater improvement in the simulator group (5 versus 2; P=0.11). Lower scores at baseline were associated with larger differences in postintervention scores between the simulator and control groups (technical performance, P=0.0006; global performance, P<0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Skills required to perform cardiac catheterization can be learned via mentored simulation training and are transferable to actual procedures in the catheterization laboratory. Less proficient operators derive greater benefit from simulator training than more proficient operators.",,1941-7632,1941-7640,https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.112.970772,"Journal Article

Rotation","After extensive practice with motor tasks sharing structural similarities (e.g., different dancing movements, or different sword techniques), new tasks of the same type can be learned faster. According to the recent ""structure learning"" hypothesis (Braun et al., 2009a), such rapid generalization of related motor skills relies on learning the dynamic and kinematic relationships shared by this set of skills. As a consequence, motor adaptation becomes constrained, effectively leading to a dimensionality reduction of the learning problem; at the same time, adaptation to tasks lying outside the structure becomes biased toward the structure. We tested these predictions by investigating how previously learned structures influence subsequent motor adaptation. Human subjects were making reaching movements in 3D virtual reality, experiencing perturbations either in the vertical or in the horizontal plane. Perturbations were either visuomotor rotations of varying angle or velocity-dependent forces of varying strength. We found that, after extensive training with both kinematic or dynamic perturbations, adaptation to unpracticed, diagonal, perturbations happened along the previously learned structure (vertical or horizontal), and resulting adaptation trajectories were curved. This effect is robust, can be observed on the single-subject level, and occurs during adaptation both within and across trials. Additionally, we demonstrate that structure learning changes involuntary visuomotor reflexes and therefore is not exclusively a high-level cognitive phenomenon.",,1529-2401,0270-6474,https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0958-12.2012,"Journal Article

Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","BACKGROUND: Traditionally, training in gastrointestinal endoscopy has been based upon an apprenticeship model, with novice endoscopists learning basic skills under the supervision of experienced preceptors in the clinical setting. Over the last two decades, however, the growing awareness of the need for patient safety has brought the issue of simulation-based training to the forefront. While the use of simulation-based training may have important educational and societal advantages, the effectiveness of virtual reality gastrointestinal endoscopy simulators has yet to be clearly demonstrated.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether virtual reality simulation training can supplement and/or replace early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience.

SEARCH METHODS: Health professions, educational and computer databases were searched until November 2011 including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Biosis Previews, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, ERIC, Education Full Text, CBCA Education, Career and Technical Education @ Scholars Portal, Education Abstracts @ Scholars Portal, Expanded Academic ASAP @ Scholars Portal, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Abstracts in New Technologies and Engineering and Computer & Information Systems Abstracts. The grey literature until November 2011 was also searched.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing virtual reality endoscopy (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy) simulation training versus any other method of endoscopy training including conventional patient-based training, in-job training, training using another form of endoscopy simulation (e.g. low-fidelity simulator), or no training (however defined by authors) were included. Trials comparing one method of virtual reality training versus another method of virtual reality training (e.g. comparison of two different virtual reality simulators) were also included. Only trials measuring outcomes on humans in the clinical setting (as opposed to animals or simulators) were included.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (CMS, MES) independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials, and extracted data on the trial characteristics and outcomes. Due to significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity it was not possible to pool study data in order to perform a meta-analysis. Where data were available for each continuous outcome we calculated standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis. Where data were available for dichotomous outcomes we calculated relative risk with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat-analysis.

MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials, with 278 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Four trials compared simulation-based training with conventional patient-based endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) whereas nine trials compared simulation-based training with no training. Only three trials were at low risk of bias. Simulation-based training, as compared with no training, generally appears to provide participants with some advantage over their untrained peers as measured by composite score of competency, independent procedure completion, performance time, independent insertion depth, overall rating of performance or competency error rate and mucosal visualization. Alternatively, there was no conclusive evidence that simulation-based training was superior to conventional patient-based training, although data were limited.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review indicate that virtual reality endoscopy training can be used to effectively supplement early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. However, there remains insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of virtual reality simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. There is a great need for the development of a reliable and valid measure of endoscopic performance prior to the completion of further randomised clinical trials with high methodological quality.",,1469-493X,1361-6137,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008237.pub2,"Journal Article

User-Computer Interface","OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and cost of 2 ex vivo training curricula for laparoscopic suturing.

BACKGROUND: Although simulators have been developed to teach laparoscopic suturing, a barrier to their wide implementation in training programs is a lack of knowledge regarding their relative training benefit and their associated cost.

METHOD: This prospective single-blinded randomized trial allocated 24 surgical residents to train to proficiency using either a virtual reality (VR) simulator or box trainer. All residents then placed intracorporeal laparoscopic stitches during a Nissen fundoplication on a patient. The operating room (OR) cases were video-recorded and technical proficiency was assessed using 2 validated tools. OR performance of both groups was compared to that of conventionally trained residents and to fellowship-trained surgeons. A cost analysis of box training, VR training, and conventional residency training across Canadian surgical programs was performed.

RESULTS: After ex vivo training, no significant differences in laparoscopic suturing in the OR were found between the 2 groups with respect to time (P = 0.74)-global rating score (P = 0.65) or checklist score (P = 0.97). It took conventionally trained residents 6 practice attempts in the OR to achieve the technical proficiency of the ex vivo trained groups (P = 0.83). VR training was more efficient than box training (transfer effectiveness ratio of 2.31 vs 1.13). The annual cost of training 5 residents on the FLS trainer box was $11,975.00, on the VR simulator was $77,500.00, and conventional residency training was $17,380.00. Over 5 years, box training was the most cost-effective option for all programs, and VR training was more cost-effective for programs with more 10 residents.

CONCLUSIONS: Training on either a VR simulator or on a box trainer significantly decreased the learning curve necessary to learn laparoscopic suturing. VR training, however, is the more efficient training modality, whereas box training the more cost-effective option.",,1528-1140,0003-4932,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0b013e31824aca09,"Comparative Study

Young Adult","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were (1) to compare different methods of learning basic laparoscopic skills using box trainer (BT), virtual reality simulator (VRS) and mental training (MT); and (2) to determine the most effective method of learning laparoscopic skills.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.

SETTING: King's College, London.

METHODS: 41 medical students were included in the study. After randomization, they were divided into 5 groups. Group 1 was the control group without training; group 2 was box trained; group 3 was also box trained with an additional practice session; group 4 was VRS trained; and group 5 was solely mentally trained. The task was to cut out a circle marked on a stretchable material. All groups were assessed after 1 week on both BT and VRS. Four main parameters were assessed, namely time, precision, accuracy, and performance.

RESULTS: Time: On BT assessment, the box-trained group with additional practice group 3 was the fastest, and the mental-trained group 5 was the slowest. On VRS assessment, the time difference between group 3 and the control group 1 was statistically significant. Precision: On BT assessment, the box-trained groups 2 and 3 scored high, and mental trained were low on precision. On VRS assessment, the VRS-trained group ranked at the top, and the MT group was at the bottom on precision. Accuracy: On BT assessment, the box-trained group 3 was best and the mental-trained group was last. On VRS assessment, the VRS-trained group 4 scored high closely followed by box-trained groups 2 and 3. Performance: On BT assessment, the box-trained group 3 ranked above all the other groups, and the mental-trained group ranked last. On VRS assessment, the VRS group 4 scored best, followed closely by box-trained groups 2 and 3.

CONCLUSIONS: The skills learned on box training were reproducible on both VRS and BT. However, not all the skills learned on VRS were transferable to BT. Furthermore, VRS was found to be a reliable and the most convenient method of assessment. MT alone cannot replace conventional training. Copyright A© 2012 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Walking/ph [Physiology]","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of virtual reality (VR) treadmill training on the balance skills of patients who have had a stroke.

DESIGN: A total of 14 patients with strokes were recruited and randomly assigned to receive VR treadmill or traditional treadmill training. The outcome measures that were included for the study were center of pressure (COP) sway excursion, COP maximum sway in anterior-posterior direction, COP maximum sway in medial-lateral direction, COP sway area, bilateral limb-loading symmetric index, the sway excursion values for the paretic foot (sway excursion/P), paretic limb stance time (stance time/P), number of steps of the paretic limb (number of steps/P), and contact area of the paretic foot (contact A/P) during quiet stance, sit-to-stand transfer, and level walking.

RESULTS: There were no significant improvements in COP-related measures and symmetric index during the quiet stance, either in the VR treadmill or traditional treadmill training group (P > 0.05). However, the difference between groups after training in COP maximum sway in medial-lateral direction during the quiet stance was significant (P = 0.038). Traditional treadmill training failed to improve sit-to-stand performance, whereas VR treadmill training improved symmetric index (P = 0.028) and sway excursion (P = 0.046) significantly during sit-to-stand transfer. The changes of symmetric index between groups were markedly different (P = 0.045). Finally, both groups improved significantly in stance time/P, but only VR treadmill training increased contact A/P (P = 0.034) after training during level walking. The difference between groups during level walking was not significant.

CONCLUSIONS: Neither traditional treadmill nor VR treadmill training had any effect on balance skill during quiet stance, but VR treadmill training improved balance skill in the medial-lateral direction better than traditional training did. VR treadmill training also improved balance skill during sit-to-stand transfers and the involvement of paretic limb in level walking more than the traditional one did.",,1537-7385,0894-9115,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0b013e3182389fae,"Comparative Study

Young Adult","Although social skills training (SST) is an effective approach for improving social skills for schizophrenia, the motivational deficit attenuates its efficacy. Virtual reality (VR) applications have allowed individuals with mental disabilities to enhance their motivation for rehabilitation. We compared SST using VR role-playing (SST-VR) to SST using traditional role-playing (SST-TR). This randomized, controlled trial included 91 inpatients with schizophrenia who were assigned to either SST-VR (n=46) or SST-TR (n=45). Both groups were administered over 10 semiweekly group sessions. An experienced, blinded rater assessed vocal, nonverbal and conversational skills. We also obtained data on motivation for SST and various social abilities. Throughout the 10 sessions, the SST-VR group (n=33) showed greater interest in SST and generalization of the skills than the SST-TR group (n=31). After SST, the SST-VR group improved more in conversational skills and assertiveness than the SST-TR group, but less in nonverbal skills. The VR application in role-plays of SST for schizophrenia may be particularly beneficial in terms of improving the conversational skills and assertiveness, possibly through its advantages in enhancing motivation for SST and generalization of the skills, and thus it may be a useful supplement to traditional SST.

METHODS: Twenty-six inexperienced surgeons underwent a training program for LC on a VR simulator. Trainees were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 specific protocols of 10 sessions comprising a total of 20 LCs. For each session, the control group performed 2 LCs separated by 30 minutes of occupational activities; the DP group were assigned 30 minutes of DP activities in between 2 LCs. Each participant then performed 2 LCs on a cadaveric porcine model. Quantitative parameters were recorded from the simulator and a motion tracking device; qualitative assessment utilized validated rating scales.

RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects completed training. Learning curves on the VR simulator were significant for time taken and number of movements in both groups. The DP group was slower from the third LC (1373 vs. 872 seconds, P = 0.022) and utilized more movements from the seventh (942 vs. 701, P = 0.033). Global rating scores improved significantly in both groups over repeated LCs. The DP group revealed higher scores than control from tenth (19.5 vs. 14, P = 0.014) until the twentieth LC (22 vs. 16, P = 0.003). On the porcine model, the DP group also achieved higher global rating scores (25.5 vs. 19.5, P = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS: VR training improved dexterity for both groups, and led to transfer of skill onto a porcine LC model. The DP group achieved higher quality, and demonstrated superior transfer onto real tissues.",,1528-1140,0003-4932,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182197016,"Journal Article

BACKGROUND: Implementation of simulation-based training into clinical practice remains limited despite evidence to show that the improvement in skills is transferred to the OR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a short virtual reality warm-up training program on laparoscopic performance in the OP.

METHODS: Sixteen Laparoscopic Cholecystectomies were performed by 8 surgeons in the OR. Participants were randomized to a group which received a preprocedure warm-up using a virtual reality simulator and no warm-up group. After the initial laparoscopic cholecystectomy all surgeons served as their own controls by performing another procedure with or without preoperative warm-up. All OR procedures were videotaped and assessed by 2 independent observers using the generic OSATS global rating scale (from 7 to 35).

RESULTS: There was significantly better surgical performance on the laparoscopic Cholecystectomy following preoperative warm-up, median 28.5 (range = 18.5-32.0) versus median 19.25 (range = 15-31.5), P = 0.042. The results demonstrated excellent reliability of the assessment tool used (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92).

CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant beneficial impact of warm-up on laparoscopic performance in the OP. The suggested program is short, easy to perform, and therefore realistic to implement in the daily life in a busy surgical department. This will potentially improve the procedural outcome and contribute to improved patient safety and better utilization of OR resources.",,1528-1140,0003-4932,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181deb630,"Journal Article

Task Performance and Analysis","BACKGROUND: To help optimize the use of limited resources in trainee education, we developed a prospective randomized trial to determine the most effective means of teaching laparoscopic suturing to novices.

METHODS: Forty-one medical students received rudimentary instruction in intracorporeal suturing, then were pretested on a pig enterotomy model. They then were posttested after completion of 1 of 4 training arms: laparoscopic suturing, laparoscopic drills, open suturing, and virtual reality (VR) drills. Tests were scored for speed, accuracy, knot quality, and mental workload (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] Task Load Index).

RESULTS: Paired t tests were used. Task time was improved in all groups except the VR group. Knot quality improved only in the open or laparoscopic suturing groups. Mental workload improved only for those practicing on a physical laparoscopic trainer.

CONCLUSIONS: For novice trainees, the efficacy of VR training is questionable. In contrast, the other training methods had benefits in terms of time, quality, and perceived workload.

Over the past 20 years, surgical simulators have been developed, initially for training of minimally invasive surgery and more recently for open surgical simulation. The key effort in today's surgical simulation field is to develop metrics to evaluate how well the skills learned in a simulator translate to improvement in real surgical skills, execution of procedures, and team cooperation in the operating room. The American College of Surgeons has begun implementing a phased approach to introduce simulation in training and education for general surgery. The authors believe that a similar training plan should be mandated for plastic surgery, to take advantage of the use of computers, virtual reality, and simulation in the training of plastic surgery residents and to explore the value of this technology for continuing medical education and maintenance of certification. This article gives a brief background and history of surgical simulation and its technology, followed by a detailed description of the three phases of the American College of Surgeons' plan and how the authors propose that each phase be implemented, with modifications as applicable for trainees in plastic surgery.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the transfer of training of LE movements to locomotion was greater using a virtual environment coupled with a robot or with the robot alone.

METHODS: A single, blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted. Eighteen individuals poststroke participated in a 4-week training protocol. One group trained with the robot virtual reality (VR) system and the other group trained with the robot alone. Outcome measures were temporal features of gait measured in a laboratory setting and the community.

RESULTS: Greater changes in velocity and distance walked were demonstrated for the group trained with the robotic device coupled with the VR than training with the robot alone. Similarly, significantly greater improvements in the distance walked and number of steps taken in the community were measured for the group that trained with robot coupled with the VR. These differences were maintained at 3 months' follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS: The study is the first to demonstrate that LE training of individuals with chronic hemiparesis using a robotic device coupled with VR improved walking ability in the laboratory and the community better than robot training alone.",,1524-4628,0039-2499,https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.516328,"Comparative Study

The purpose of this study was to determine which of two educational interventions allows learners to gain greater capacity for performing the procedure.

METHODS: Respiratory therapists were randomly assigned to a low-fidelity or high-fidelity training model group. The low-fidelity group was guided by experts, on a nonanatomic model designed to refine fiberoptic manipulation skills. The high-fidelity group practiced their skills on a computerized virtual reality bronchoscopy simulator. After training, subjects performed two consecutive FOIs on healthy, anesthetized patients with predicted ""easy"" intubations. Each subject's FOI was evaluated by blinded examiners, using a validated global rating scale and checklist. Success and time were also measured.

RESULTS: Data were analyzed using a two-way mixed design analysis of variance. There was no significant difference between the low-fidelity (n = 14) and high-fidelity (n = 14) model groups when compared with the global rating scale, checklist, time, and success at achieving tracheal intubation (all P = not significant). Second attempts in both groups were significantly better than first attempts (P < 0.001), and there was no interaction between ""fidelity of training model"" and ""first versus second attempt"" scores.

CONCLUSIONS: There was no added benefit from training on a costly virtual reality model with respect to transfer of FOI skills to intraoperative patient care. Second attempts in both groups were significantly better than first attempts. Low-fidelity models for FOI training outside the operating room are an alternative for programs with budgetary constraints.",,1528-1175,0003-3022,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ALN.0b013e31818d6c3c,"Comparative Study

Radiosurgery","The emerging future of cerebral surgery will witness the refined evolution of current techniques, as well as the introduction of numerous novel concepts. Clinical practice and basic science research will benefit greatly from their application. The sum of these efforts will result in continued minimalism and improved accuracy and efficiency of neurosurgical diagnostic and therapeutic methodologies. Initially, the refinement of current technologies will further enhance various aspects of cerebral surgery. Advances in computing power and information technology will speed data acquisition, storage, and transfer. Miniaturization of current devices will impact diverse areas, such as modulation of endoscopy and endovascular techniques. The increased penetrance of surgical technologies such as stereotactic radiosurgery, neuronavigation, intraoperative imaging, and implantable electrodes for neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy will enhance the knowledge and experience in these areas and facilitate refinements and advances in these technologies. Further into the future, technologies that are currently relatively remote to surgical events will fundamentally alter the complexity and scale at which a neurological disease may be treated or investigated. Seemingly futuristic concepts will become ubiquitous in the daily experience of the neurosurgeon. These include diverse fields such as nanotechnology, virtual reality, and robotics. Ultimately, combining advances in multiple fields will yield progress in diverse realms such as brain tumor therapy, neuromodulation for psychiatric diseases, and neuroprosthetics. Operating room equipment and design will benefit from each of the aforementioned advances. In this work, we discuss new developments in three parts. In Part I, concepts in minimalism important for future cerebral surgery are discussed. These include concrete and abstract ideas in miniaturization, as well as recent and future work in microelectromechanical systems and nanotechnology. Part II presents advances in computational sciences and technological fields dependent on these developments. Future breakthroughs in the components of the ""computer,"" including data storage, electrical circuitry, and computing hardware and techniques, are discussed. Additionally, important concepts in the refinement of virtual environments and the brain-machine interface are presented, as their incorporation into cerebral surgery is closely linked to advances in computing and electronics. Finally, Part III offers insights into the future evolution of surgical and nonsurgical diagnostic and therapeutic modalities that are important for the future cerebral surgeon. A number of topics relevant to cerebral surgery are discussed, including the operative environment, imaging technologies, endoscopy, robotics, neuromodulation, stem cell therapy, radiosurgery, and technical methods of restoration of neural function. Cerebral surgery in the near and distant future will reflect the application of these emerging technologies. As this article indicates, the key to maximizing the impact of these advancements in the clinical arena is continued collaboration between scientists and neurosurgeons, as well as the emergence of a neurosurgeon whose scientific grounding and technical focus are far removed from those of his predecessors.",,1524-4040,0148-396X,https://dx.doi.org/10.1227/01.neu.0000333820.33143.0d,Journal Article,"10.1227/01.neu.0000333820.33143.0d [doi]

Video Recording","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic suturing is one of the most difficult tasks in endoscopic surgery, requiring extensive training. The aim of this study was to determine the transfer validity of knot-tying training on a virtual-reality (VR) simulator to a realistic laparoscopic environment.

METHODS: Twenty surgical trainees underwent basic eye-hand coordination training on a VR simulator (SIMENDO, DelltaTech, Delft, The Netherlands) until predefined performance criteria were met. Then, they were randomized into two groups. Group A (the experimental group) received additional training with the knot-tying module on the simulator, during which they had to tie a double laparoscopic knot ten times. Group B (controls) did not receive additional manual training. Within a week the participants tied a double knot in the abdominal cavity of an anaesthetized porcine model. Their performance was captured on digital video and coded. Objective analysis parameters were: time taken to tie the knot and number of predefined errors made. Subjective assessments were also made by two laparoscopic surgeons using a global rating list with a five-point Likert scale.

RESULTS: Trainees in group A (n = 9) were significantly faster than the controls (n = 10), with a median of 262 versus 374 seconds (p = 0.034). Group A made a significantly lower number of errors than the controls (median of 24 versus 36 errors, p = 0.030). Subjective assessments by the laparoscopic experts did not show any significant differences in economy of movement and erroneous behavior between the two groups.

CONCLUSION: Surgical trainees who received knot-tying training on the VR simulator were faster and made fewer errors than the controls. The VR module is a useful tool to train laparoscopic knot-tying. Opportunities arose to improve simulator-based instruction that might enhance future training.",,1432-2218,0930-2794,,"Journal Article

The objective of this review was to study different virtual reality training applications as well as their clinical implication for patients with mobility problems. Computerized literature searches were performed using the MEDLINE, Cochrane, CIRRIE and REHABDATA databases. This resulted in eight peer reviewed journal articles. The included studies could be divided into three categories, on the basis of their study objective. Five studies were related to training driving skills, two to physical exercise training and one to leisure activity. This review suggests that virtual reality is a potentially useful means to improve the use of a mobility device, in training one's driving skills, for keeping up the physical condition and also in a way of leisure time activity. Although this field of research appears to be in its early stages, the included studies pointed out a promising transfer of training in a virtual environment to the real-life use of mobility devices.

METHOD: A flat-screen 2DVR based training programme and a corresponding, typical psycho-educational programme with video modelling were developed for comparison through a research design that involved a randomised control group pre-test and post-test.

RESULTS: Twenty and sixteen subjects respectively received 10 training sessions using the 2DVR strategy and a video-based psycho-educational programme. An additional 22 subjects formed the control group. They were assessed by using a behavioural checklist of MTR skills and a newly validated MTR self-efficacy scale. The subjects of both training groups showed a significant improvement in their knowledge, skills and self-efficacy in using the MTR (p<0.01), whereas, the MTR skills and self-efficacy of the control group remained stable over a four-week interval.

CONCLUSION: Though both training programmes were effective in training the patients with stroke, they demonstrated differential improvements in MTR skills and related self-efficacy. Additional studies are recommended to identify the most effective training procedures for maintaining these skills and the best transfer ratio in the training of VR-based community living skills of people with stroke.",,,1053-8135,,"Journal Article

In this overview we aim to update the current knowledge in the field of laparoscopic urological training and to highlight the potential dangers of using simulation for accreditation and selection purposes at this stage.

RECENT FINDINGS: Physical simulators are widely available and seem to be equally efficient as virtual reality simulators. Transfer of training has been proven to be beneficial in randomized controlled trials for virtual reality and cholecystectomy. A model for the vesico-urethral suture has been described and integrated in a skills laboratory program. The program has construct validity and can discriminate at least between beginners and advanced laparoscopists. Efforts have still to be made in defining appropriate tools to assess competence and evidence for reliability, and validity must be obtained before including simulators in accreditation programs.

SUMMARY: In spite of the abundant literature there is still little evidence about the learning mechanism involved in acquiring laparoscopic skills. Physical and virtual reality simulators have been proven to be efficient in improving dexterity and some evidence exists of a positive transfer from virtual reality to the operating room in cholecystectomy. Very few models, however, have been described for reconstructive urology, and effective transfer to the operating room has not yet been proven, although validation work is in progress in the field of urology.

This review will focus on arm movements and address the following questions: (i) What is motor learning? (ii) Do patients with hemiparesis have a learning deficit? (iii) Is recovery after injury a form of motor learning? (iv) Are approaches based on motor learning principles useful for rehabilitation?

RECENT FINDINGS: Motor learning can be broken into kinematic and dynamic components. Studies in healthy subjects suggest that retention of motor learning is best accomplished with variable training schedules. Animal models and functional imaging in humans show that the mature brain can undergo plastic changes during both learning and recovery. Quantitative motor control approaches allow differentiation between compensation and true recovery, although both improve with practice. Several promising new rehabilitation approaches are based on theories of motor learning. These include impairment oriented-training (IOT), constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), electromyogram (EMG)-triggered neuromuscular stimulation, robotic interactive therapy and virtual reality (VR).

SUMMARY: Motor learning mechanisms are operative during spontaneous stroke recovery and interact with rehabilitative training. For optimal results, rehabilitation techniques should be geared towards patients' specific motor deficits and possibly combined, for example, CIMT with VR. Two critical questions that should always be asked of a rehabilitation technique are whether gains persist for a significant period after training and whether they generalize to untrained tasks.

RECENT FINDINGS: Increased support has been generated for the efficacy of a minimal, home-based vertigo-habituation program for adults with peripheral vestibular disorders. Vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be associated with improvements in independence and dynamic visual acuity. Community-based vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be efficacious for selected patients, after careful screening, when trained personnel provide intervention. Vestibular rehabilitation has been incorporated into the rehabilitation program for head-injured military personnel who will be returned to duty, and multifactorial balance rehabilitation has been shown to be useful for children with hearing and balance impairments. Virtual reality techniques have made significant advances, so immersive environments have potential for rehabilitation for patients with vestibular disorders and for developing training regimens for astronauts to ameliorate some effects of exposure to microgravity. Driving skill, in general, is affected by use of benzodiazepines. For many patients with vestibular impairments driving is a particularly problematic activity of daily living.

SUMMARY: Progress has been made in studies of acute care, community-based, and pediatric vestibular rehabilitation. Work on simulator-based paradigms has moved toward readiness for implementation. Studies of driving have provided some insight into the problems of these patients. More work remains to be done on all of these problems. [References: 64]",,,1350-7540,,"Journal Article

The simulator displays realistic human knee anatomy derived from the Visible Human Dataset developed by the National Library of Medicine and incorporates active force-feedback haptic technology. Our premise is that postgraduate year 2 residents completing a formal virtual education program who are trained to reach a proficiency standard in the techniques and protocol for an arthroscopic knee examination will complete a diagnostic arthroscopy on an actual patient in less time with greater accuracy, less iteration of movement of the arthroscope, and less damage to the patient's tissue compared with residents in the control group learning and practicing the arthroscopic knee examination procedures through the residency program's established education and training program. The validation study, done at eight orthopaedic residency programs, will commence in early 2006 and will take one year to complete. We anticipate that proficiency obtained on the simulator will transfer to surgical skills in the operating room.",,,0009-921X,,Journal Article,"00003086-200601000-00005 [pii]

METHOD: Children participated in a study by using a multiple baseline, multiple probe design. Before the game, no child could correctly describe what actions to take during a home fire. A computerized game allowed them to learn the recommended safety steps in a virtual world. Skill learning and real-world generalization were tested immediately after the intervention and at 1-week post-test.

RESULTS: All children reached 100% accuracy on the computer intervention, defined as successfully completing each of the safety steps. At the 1-week follow-up, all the children were able to perform the steps correctly in a real world simulation.

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that this method of intervention warrants further study as an educational delivery system for children with FAS.",,,0146-8693,,"Journal Article

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: For surgical training in laparoscopic surgery, new training methods have to be developed that allow surgeons to first practice in a simulated setting before operating on real patients. A virtual endoscopic surgery trainer (VEST) has been developed within the framework of a joint project. Because of principal limitations of simulation techniques, it is essential to know whether training with this simulator is comparable to conventional training.

METHODS: Devices used were the VEST system and a conventional video trainer (CVT). Two basic training tasks were constructed identically (a) as virtual tasks and (b) as mechanical models for the CVT. Test persons were divided into 2 groups each consisting of 12 novices and 4 experts. Each group carried out a defined training program over the course of 4 consecutive days on the VEST or the CVT, respectively. To test the transfer of skills, the groups switched devices on the 5th day. The main parameter was task completion time.

RESULTS: The novices in both groups showed similar learning curves. The mean task completion times decreased significantly over the 4 training days of the study. The task completion times for the control task on Day 5 were significantly lower than on Days 1 and 2. The experts' task completion times were much lower than those of the novices.

CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that training with a computer simulator, just as with the CVT, resulted in a reproducible training effect. The control task showed that skills learned in virtual reality are transferable to the physical reality of a CVT. The fact that the experts showed little improvement demonstrates that the simulation trains surgeons in basic laparoscopic skills learned in years of practice.",,,0003-4932,,"Clinical Trial

The learning and practice of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) makes unique demands on surgical training programs. A decade ago Satava proposed virtual reality (VR) surgical simulation as a solution for this problem. Only recently have robust scientific studies supported that vision

METHODS: A review of the surgical education, human-factor, and psychology literature to identify important factors which will impinge on the successful integration of VR training into a surgical training program.

RESULTS: VR is more likely to be successful if it is systematically integrated into a well-thought-out education and training program which objectively assesses technical skills improvement proximate to the learning experience. Validated performance metrics should be relevant to the surgical task being trained but in general will require trainees to reach an objectively determined proficiency criterion, based on tightly defined metrics and perform at this level consistently. VR training is more likely to be successful if the training schedule takes place on an interval basis rather than massed into a short period of extensive practice. High-fidelity VR simulations will confer the greatest skills transfer to the in vivo surgical situation, but less expensive VR trainers will also lead to considerably improved skills generalizations.

CONCLUSIONS: VR for improved performance of MIS is now a reality. However, VR is only a training tool that must be thoughtfully introduced into a surgical training curriculum for it to successfully improve surgical technical skills.",,,0003-4932,,Journal Article,"00000658-200502000-00024 [pii]

METHODS: Twenty four novices were tested to determine their baseline laparoscopic skills and then randomized into the following three group: LapSim, box trainer, and no training (control). After 3 weekly training sessions lasting 30-min each, all subjects were reassessed. Assessment included motion analysis and error scores. Nonparametric tests were applied, and p < 0.05 was deemed significant.

RESULTS: Both trained groups made significant improvements in all parameters measured ( p < 0.05). Compared to the controls, the box trainer group performed significantly better on most of the parameters, whereas the LapSim group performed significantly better on some parameters. There were no significant differences between the LapSim and box trainer groups.

CONCLUSIONS: LapSim is effective in teaching skills that are transferable to a real laparoscopic task. However, there appear to be no substantial advantages of one system over the other.",,1432-2218,0930-2794,,"Clinical Trial

A randomized pre/posttest experimental design was used. Seventy-seven baccalaureate nursing students in a required, senior-level critical-care course at a large midwestern university were recruited for the study. Two teaching methods were compared. The traditional method included a self-study module, a brief lecture and demonstration by an instructor, and hands-on experience using a plastic manikin and a real 12-lead ECG machine in the learning laboratory. The second method covered the same content using an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM embedded with virtual reality and supplemented with a self-study module. There were no significant (p < .05) baseline differences in pretest scores between the two groups and no significant differences by group in cognitive gains, student satisfaction with their learning method, or perception of self-efficacy in performing the skill. Overall results indicated that both groups were satisfied with their instructional method and were similar in their ability to demonstrate the skill correctly on a live, simulated patient. This evaluation study is a beginning step to assess new and potentially more cost-effective teaching methods and their effects on student learning outcomes and behaviors, including the transfer of skill acquisition via a computer simulation to a real patient.",,,1536-5026,,"Clinical Trial

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The use of VR surgical simulation to train skills and reduce error risk in the OR has never been demonstrated in a prospective, randomized, blinded study.

METHODS: Sixteen surgical residents (PGY 1-4) had baseline psychomotor abilities assessed, then were randomized to either VR training (MIST VR simulator diathermy task) until expert criterion levels established by experienced laparoscopists were achieved (n = 8), or control non-VR-trained (n = 8). All subjects performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an attending surgeon blinded to training status. Videotapes of gallbladder dissection were reviewed independently by two investigators blinded to subject identity and training, and scored for eight predefined errors for each procedure minute (interrater reliability of error assessment r > 0.80).

RESULTS: No differences in baseline assessments were found between groups. Gallbladder dissection was 29% faster for VR-trained residents. Non-VR-trained residents were nine times more likely to transiently fail to make progress (P <.007, Mann-Whitney test) and five times more likely to injure the gallbladder or burn nontarget tissue (chi-square = 4.27, P <.04). Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group (1.19 vs. 7.38 errors per case; P <.008, Mann-Whitney test).

CONCLUSIONS: The use of VR surgical simulation to reach specific target criteria significantly improved the OR performance of residents during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This validation of transfer of training skills from VR to OR sets the stage for more sophisticated uses of VR in assessment, training, error reduction, and certification of surgeons.",,,0003-4932,,"Clinical Trial

METHODS: Thirty medical students underwent a pretest using a real laparoscopic trainer. They were then randomized to the following three groups: group I received no training; group II received training using the Minimal Invasive Surgical Trainer in Virtual Reality (MIST-VR); and group III received training using conventional training exercises. Each group then underwent a posttest. Using the Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device (ICSAD), scores were generated for time taken, distance traveled, number of movements made, and speed of instrument movement.

RESULTS: Significant changes between the MIST-VR group (group II) and the conventionally trained group (group III), were observed in the speed of movement of the left hand and the numbers of movements taken by each hand, when compared to the untrained group (group I).

CONCLUSION: The training of novices using MIST-VR yields quantifiable changes in skill that are transferable to a simple real task and are similar to the results achieved with conventional training.",,1432-2218,0930-2794,,"Clinical Trial

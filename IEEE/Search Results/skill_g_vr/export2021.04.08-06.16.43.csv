We explored how visual feedback influenced the coordinate frame in which the CNS stores and recalls these memories of learned skills in a reaching-generalization task. Four groups of subjects trained to perform reaching movements in a perturbing force field, two with aligned (first person) visual feedback and two with non-aligned (vertical screen). After 170 trials of practice, we asked subjects to extrapolate (generalize) what they learned to a new part of the workspace in novel force environments (endpoint-based versus joint-based extrapolated force fields). Regardless of the test condition, all subjects improved their ability to generalize skills to the new workspace. There was evidence that the extrapolation of their learned skills was based on both object-centered and joint-based coordinates. Consistent with previous studies, subjects performed significantly better in joint-extrapolated force field, but only if the visual feedback was vertical. Subjects performed equivalently in both force fields with aligned (first person) feedback. These findings suggest that the type of visual feedback biases the way subjects perform, and that learning results can be significantly influenced by feedback.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091668","","Training;Visualization;Force;Joints;Adaptation models;Robots;Trajectory","cognition;neurophysiology","simultaneous coordinate representation;visual feedback;motor learning task;coordinate reference frame;learned skill;reaching generalization task;perturbing force field","Adult;Algorithms;Biomechanics;Central Nervous System;Computers;Equipment Design;Feedback, Sensory;Humans;Models, Statistical;Motor Activity;Motor Skills;Movement;Psychomotor Performance;Range of Motion, Articular;Robotics;User-Computer Interface;Viscosity","4","","36","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Self-organization problems, intrinsic behaviors as well as effective learning and skill transfer processes in the context of robotic systems have been significantly investigated by researchers. Our work presents a new framework of developmental skill learning process by introducing a hierarchical nested multi-agent architecture. A neuro-dynamic learning mechanism employing function approximators in a fuzzified state-space is utilized, leading to a collaborative control scheme among the distributed agents engaged in a continuous space, which enables the multi-agent system to learn, over a period of time, how to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner without any prior task model. The agents comprising the system manage to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform by continuously exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space. For the specific problem setting, the proposed theoretical framework is employed in the case of two simulated e-Puck robots performing a collaborative box-pushing task. This task involves active cooperation between the robots in order to jointly push an object on a plane to a specified goal location. We should note that 1) there are no contact points specified for the two e-Pucks and 2) the shape of the object is indifferent. The actuated wheels of the mobile robots are considered as the independent agents that have to build up cooperative skills over time, in order for the robot to demonstrate intelligent behavior. Our goal in this experimental study is to evaluate both the proposed hierarchical multi-agent architecture, as well as the methodological control framework. Such a hierarchical multi-agent approach is envisioned to be highly scalable for the control of complex biologically inspired robot locomotion systems.","","978-1-4244-9318-0","10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5723346","Developmental Robotics;Multi-Agent Architectures;Neuro-Dynamic Learning","Mobile robots;Computer architecture;Joints;Robot kinematics;Function approximation;Collaboration","dynamic programming;fuzzy set theory;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems","fuzzy rule based neuro-dynamic programming;mobile robot skill acquisition;nested multiagent architecture;biologically inspired architectures;intelligent robots;self-organization problems;effective learning;skill transfer processes;developmental skill learning process;neuro-dynamic learning mechanism;function approximators;collaborative control scheme;distributed agents;multiagent system;e-Puck robots;collaborative box-pushing task;complex biologically inspired robot locomotion systems","","2","","31","","3 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Projective simulation agents have been applied successfully in the context of complex skill learning in robotics and the design of the state-of-the-art quantum experiments. In this paper, we study the performance of projective simulation in two benchmarking problems in navigation, namely, the grid world and the mountain car problem. The performance of projective simulation is compared to standard tabular reinforcement learning approaches, Q-learning, and SARSA. Our comparison demonstrates that the performance of projective simulation and standard learning approaches are qualitatively and quantitatively similar, while it is much easier to choose optimal model parameters in the case of projective simulation with reduced computational effort of one to two orders of magnitude. Our results show that the projective simulation model stands out for its simplicity in terms of the number of model parameters, which makes it simple to set up the learning agent in unknown task environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876494","Austrian Science Fund; Templeton World Charity Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8494753","Reinforcement learning;projective simulation;benchmarking tasks;navigation problems;random processes;quantum mechanics;learning;delayed rewards;Markov decision processes","Computational modeling;Task analysis;Navigation;Benchmark testing;Standards;Automobiles;Learning (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)","episodic memory;complex skill learning;robotics;computational effort;mountain car problem;Q-learning;quantum mechanical generalization;reinforcement learning agents;projective simulation model;standard tabular reinforcement learning approaches;projective simulation agents","","","","35","","17 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are many examples of the use of various software products, which are used to create educational materials in the form of electronic lectures, simulators, presentations, virtual objects based on ideas of augmented reality, etc. In addition to the methodical effects of using these technologies for achieving the best results in mastering the studied material by the students, each technology can be evaluated by the complexity and cost of creating a complete educational product, as well as the time it takes to create it. And often it turns out that an externally effective, expensive solution in practice does not lead to a noticeable improvement in mastering the material at the required level, estimated by the appropriate consolidation of knowledge, skills and competencies.The ability to use the calculator dexterously cannot replace the oral account and the knowledge of the multiplication table, and colorful films - traditional reading of books. The explanation for this lies in the peculiarities of human perception of the surrounding reality and the complex processes of its psycho-emotional perception.Noting this provision, at the same time it should be emphasized that this does not mean denying the effective use of infocommunications in education, or rather in learning. This should be understood as a call for reasonable coexistence of new and traditional methods with their justified and natural modernization and transformation with the use of infocommunications.Based on scientific articles, monographs, meetings, discussions of various scientific problems, the most qualified and experienced educators create the basis of learning - textbooks. It seems that they should provide a description of the relevant discipline at the high scientific level, taking into account the existing multi-level system of education in Russia.Modern infocommunication technologies offer new opportunities in the creation of so-called electronic textbooks, where a broad interconnected educational space is actually organized with the use of multimedia capabilities for displaying information and creating hyperlinks. However, due to this fact, namely the need for mutual linking and coordination, the creation of full-fledged electronic textbooks, in fact global network structures, becomes a complicated and slow process. Therefore, tactically and with understanding of the perspective, it is advisable at present to focus on the formation of electronic fragments of the future global educational infrastructure.To solve this problem, we will assume that the textbook on a particular discipline exists in traditional or some other form. It is necessary to create on its basis the additional, but no less important, methodical materials in the form of lectures for students, testing and controlling complexes, control works and tasks, laboratory work, and so on.","","978-1-5386-6474-2","10.1109/SYNCHROINFO.2018.8457003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457003","educational environment;educational materials;electronic lectures (e-lectures);electronic courses (e-courses);infocommunication technologies;presentation","Standards organizations;Organizations;Testing;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning","computer aided instruction;educational institutions","scientific level;multilevel system;Russia;electronic textbooks;hyperlinks;educational product;infocommunication technologies;interconnected educational space;psycho-emotional perception;human perception;oral account;augmented reality;virtual objects;electronic lectures;educational materials;software products;modern educational institutions;methodical materials;future global educational infrastructure;electronic fragments;full-fledged electronic textbooks;qualified experienced educators;scientific problems;scientific articles;natural modernization;infocommunications","","","","12","","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The package offers pin counts in excess of 1800 with higher electrical performance compared to traditional BGA package. To develop the widest range of flip chip interconnect packages to meet consumer's demand is first target. In flip-chip packaging technology, the underfill encapsulation is one of the important processes to obtain a significant improvement in fatigue lifetime for the solder joints between IC chip and substrate. The advanced design of electronic devices aiming at the enhancement of the performance involves the increase of the number of solder bumps, smaller size of the IC chip and smaller gap height between IC chip and substrate. That leads to various problems caused by the flow behavior, such as voids in underfill process. In general, the product process engineer needs to take long time to do short-shot to find out well underfill flow pattern of dispensation parameter that balance flow pattern means underfill melt-front is with small difference gap between center and edge less than 10 bumps. Therefore, we want to use simulation skill to do underfill process prediction and find out good solution to provide well dispense parameter to control void issue and support product process engineer with underfill simulation result to reduce manpower resource. In this paper, we study FCBGA with die size as 22×20 mm and bump counts about more than 7000, and we compare different dispensation of three different I-pass lengths of 30%, 50%, 70% along die edge with different underfill weight (mg).

Besides, the mobility of teachers and students among European universities has increased notably, which is a very positive experience for both communities. In this regard, new educational alternatives have to be found for this purpose, not only to provide the possibility of studying a subject abroad, but also to improve cross-curricular capabilities. It is also a reality to be taken into account that an increasing number of students are already working in the industry while following up their studies. E-learning environments are the perfect answer to these requirements, where a varied range of activities and methodologies can be used for allowing to follow the subject virtually as well as promote general cross-curricular skills such as addressing an audience, team work and preparing documentation. In this sense this paper describes the author's experiences with e-learning environments in the situations described above, which have been carried out with positive results: students have improved their general cross- curricular skills and were able to follow the subject from outside the university campus.","","978-0-7695-3163-2","10.1109/ICIW.2008.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545591","Virtual Environments;EHEA;Teaching Experience;Cross-Curricular Capacities;Mobility-related learning","Virtual environment;Educational institutions;Education;Electronic learning;Qualifications;Web and internet services;Application software;Software engineering;Documentation;Electrical capacitance tomography","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;teaching","virtual environment;educational curricula;European Higher Education Area;teaching;European university;e-learning;cross-curricular skills","","1","","10","","20 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a driver behavior characteristics identification strategy based on bionic intelligent algorithms. First, a driver behavior data acquisition system is established to be used with test subjects of different driving skill levels for driving data acquisition. The preview optimal curvature model, which directly reflects the driver's behavior characteristics based on its parameters, is then chosen as the ideal driver behavior model and is identified through the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and back propagation neural network. Moreover, this paper discusses the application of driver behavior characteristics identification in an integrated chassis control system (ICC), which integrates active front steering with electronic stability control. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the identification results and the application in the ICC by PanoSim and MATLAB/Simulink software. Based on the results, the proposed identification strategy precisely characterized the driver behavior. As a result, its application in the ICC improved the path-following ability and vehicle stability performance of the drivers.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2018.2861225","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key R&D Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8435925","Bionic intelligent algorithms;back propagation (BP) neural network (NN);driver behavior characteristics identification;genetic algorithm (GA);integrated chassis control (ICC);particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Particle swarm optimization;Hidden Markov models;Genetic algorithms;Real-time systems;Backpropagation;Monitoring;Neural networks","backpropagation;behavioural sciences computing;data acquisition;driver information systems;genetic algorithms;neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;psychology;road traffic","bionic intelligent algorithms;active safety control system;advanced driver assistance system;intelligent traffic system;driver behavior characteristics identification strategy;driver behavior data acquisition system;genetic algorithm;particle swarm optimization;integrated chassis control system;electronic stability control;driver behavior model;driving skill levels;back propagation neural network;psychological signals","","2","","29","","14 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: The system is first described, followed by an experimental study of 20 experts from four clinical specialties performing ten DREs each on a benchtop model using the proposed system. Analysis of the constitutive steps was conducted to improve understanding of the examination. A Markov model representing executed tasks and analysis of pressure applied is also introduced. Results: The proposed system successfully allowed the visualization and analysis during the experimental study. General practitioners and nurses were found to execute more tasks compared to urologists and colorectal surgeons. Urologists executed the least number of tasks and were the most consistent group compared to others. Conclusion: The ability to “see through” allowed us to better characterize the performance of experts when conducting a DRE on a benchtop model, comparing the performance of relevant specialties, and studying executed tasks and the pressure applied. The Markov model presented summarizes task execution of experts and could be used to compare the performance of novices against that of experts.

The need to deliver smart transmitters with accompanying control data at low cost is highly dependent on reliable, high-speed test and measurement (T+M). We report principle of operation and performance for a suite of T+M modules that deliver look-up-table (LUT) data that is individual to each device-under-test. This LUT accompanies the laser for its 20-year life-cycle and even incorporates adaptive control to cater for potential ageing. Examples that relate to DBR (10 nm tunability or quarter C-band) and full C-band lasers will be given where the test platform relies on the PXI (PCI derivative) bus with a ""de-skilling"" graphical user interface. The general concept has also been deployed for HB-LED screening. Optical outputs are power and wavelength while inputs are multiple analogue drive currents that control each laser section; there may be up to eleven electrodes on these laser diode chips. The chip-on-carrier (C-on-C) is first screened by a fast probe station to ascertain full tunability with high power. The butterfly-packaged device is fully characterised later through another application producing the individual digital LUT. Fast wavelength mapping for a multitude of control possibilities is essential at 100 kHz sweeps and slow GPIB must be substituted by PXI bus, which is extended PCI for instrumentation. Custom optics allows photodiodes to work in the wavelength domain. The complete platform, deployable R/D to production, and illustrative results will be described.","","0-7803-8722-8","10.1109/LTIMC.2004.1370998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370998","","Tunable circuits and devices;Optical transmitters;High speed optical techniques;Table lookup;Semiconductor lasers;Testing;Semiconductor device measurement;Optical devices;Semiconductor devices;Automatic control","laser tuning;semiconductor lasers;optical transmitters;optical testing;modules;table lookup;adaptive control;distributed Bragg reflector lasers;peripheral interfaces;graphical user interfaces;light emitting diodes;packaging;photodiodes;automatic testing","automated screening;PXI-based screening;tunable lasers;fast measurement;rugged measurement;optical output measurement;complex semiconductor devices;optoelectronics industry;smart transmitters;control data;reliable measurement;high-speed test;look-up-table data;device-under-test;adaptive control;DBR lasers;C-band lasers;graphical user interface;HB-LED screening;multiple analogue drive currents;electrodes;laser diode chips;chip-on-carrier;fast probe station;butterfly-packaged device;digital LUT;fast wavelength mapping;GPIB;PXI bus;photodiodes;automatic testing","","2","1","3","","27 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been shown that when a single reaching movement is repeated in unstable dynamics, the central nervous system (CNS) learns an impedance internal model to compensate for the environment instability. However, there is still no explanation for how humans can learn to move in various directions in such environments. In this study, we investigated whether and how humans compensate for instability while learning two different reaching movements simultaneously. Results show that when performing movements in two different directions, separated by a 35° angle, the CNS was able to compensate for the unstable dynamics. After adaptation, the force was found to be similar to the free movement condition, but stiffness increased in the direction of instability, specifically for each direction of movement. Our findings suggest that the CNS either learned an internal model generalizing over different movements, or alternatively that it was able to switch between specific models acquired simultaneously.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4650425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650425","","","","","Adult;Arm;Computer Simulation;Elastic Modulus;Feedback;Humans;Learning;Models, Biological;Motor Skills;Movement;Stress, Mechanical;Task Performance and Analysis;Viscosity;Young Adult","3","2","15","","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to 1.5 cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment.

To facilitate the establishment of the GIM, in this paper, we further explored algorithms for detecting periodicity of and phase difference between rhythmic movements, and neural network structures suitable for learning motion patterns.

In both cases, a learner has to resolve concurrently multiple types of ambiguities while learning how to act in response to particular contexts through the observation of a teacher's demonstrations. We argue that computational models of language acquisition and models of motor skill learning by demonstration have so far only considered distinct subsets of these types of ambiguities, leading to the use of distinct families of techniques across two loosely connected research domains. We present a computational model, mixing concepts and techniques from these two domains, involving a simulated robot learner interacting with a human teacher. Proof-of-concept experiments show that: 1) it is possible to consider simultaneously a larger set of ambiguities than considered so far in either domain; and 2) this allows us to model important aspects of language acquisition and motor learning within a single process that does not initially separate what is “linguistic” from what is “nonlinguistic.” Rather, the model shows that a general form of imitation learning can allow a learner to discover channels of communication used by an ambiguous teacher, thus addressing a form of abstract Gavagai problem (ambiguity about which observed behavior is “linguistic”, and in that case which modality is communicative).","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2013.2279277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588874","Discovering linguistic channels;imitation learning;language acquisition;motor Gavagai problem;robot learning by demonstration;sensorimotor learning","Context;Pragmatics;Acoustic waves;Computational modeling;Speech;Robot sensing systems","human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;robot programming","motor learning by demonstration;ambiguous teacher;simulated robot learner;proof-of-concept experiments;motor skill learning;teacher demonstrations;human teachers;multiple context-dependent sensorimotor skills;language acquisition;Gavagai problem;nonlinguistic sensorimotor skills;multiple linguistic skills;unified imitation learning","","2","","69","","4 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The process model is a pair of highly interactive components that together mimic the behavior of the human-environment system. One component is a representation of the external environment as a dynamically changing set of opportunities for action. The second component is a dynamic representation of skilled human decision making and planning behavior within the environment so described. The process model is an expression of a general theory of skilled interaction assuming that perception and action mechanisms sensitive to environmental constraints are responsible for generating much of behavior, and where the need for additional cognitive processing of internal representations may result from environmental designs that do not adequately support the perceptual guidance of activity.<>","2168-2909","","10.1109/21.247880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=247880","","Supervisory control;Humans;Psychology;Man machine systems;Systems engineering and theory;Environmental factors;Laboratories;Biological system modeling;Constraint theory;Systems, man, and cybernetics","human factors;man-machine systems;sensitivity analysis","supervisory control;uncertain environment;dynamic environment;skilled human-environment interaction;process model;psychological factor;environmental factors;human decision making;planning behavior;perception;action mechanisms","","45","","59","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve typhoon forecast, the “Global 7-km mesh nonhydrostatic model inter-comparison project for improving typhoon forecast (TYMIP-G7)” has been conducted under the JAMSTEC Earth Simulator Strategic Project with Special Support. In the project, ensemble of the 5-day typhoon forecast experiments in September and October 2013 were conducted by using three nonhydrostatic global atmospheric models. Preliminary results indicate that the nonhydrostatic models significantly improve the forecast skill in terms of typhoon intensity. However, the atmospheric models used in TYMIP-G7 are not fully coupled with ocean. This study aims to investigate the impact of ocean coupling on typhoon simulation by using a nonhydrostatic global ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation model. It was found that the forecast error of typhoon intensity ranged from - 10 hPa to 10 hPa at the forecast time of 60 hours in the coupled model. We also found that there is no marked difference in the modeled typhoon intensity at the forecast lead time of 36 hours between the coupled model and standalone atmospheric model; however, the typhoon intensity was weakened after the forecast lead time of 36 hours in the coupled model compared to the standalone model. On the other hand, the forecast error of typhoon track was not changed by ocean coupling, indicating that large scale atmospheric circulations were not changed by ocean coupling in the 5-day simulation.","","978-1-5090-2445-2","10.1109/Techno-Ocean.2016.7890683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890683","typhoon;ocean-atmosphere coupled model","Atmospheric modeling;Tropical cyclones;Predictive models;Couplings;Computational modeling;Ocean temperature","storms;weather forecasting","typhoon intensity;typhoon track;typhoon disasters;Global 7-km mesh nonhydrostatic model inter-comparison project for improving typhoon forecast;JAMSTEC Earth Simulator Strategic Project with Special Support;typhoon forecast experiments;AD 2013 09 to 10;typhoon simulation;nonhydrostatic models;forecast skill;atmospheric models;ocean coupling;nonhydrostatic global ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation model;forecast error;atmospheric circulations","","1","","20","","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach to the design of human-centered decision aids is ecological interface design, which focuses on visualizing the boundaries of safe system performance rather than prescribing predetermined strategies or discrete solutions. Previous studies with ecological interfaces in the aviation domain revealed that humans sometimes opted for control actions close to these boundaries, giving rise to a general concern about the robustness of control actions. The goal of this study has been to empirically investigate how effectively an ecological interface for 4-D trajectory management, as developed in a previous study, supports the preservation of airspace robustness. For this purpose, a metric has been developed to evaluate both minimum and average sector-based and control-based robustness. Special attention was paid to quantifying and measuring the effect of expertise level on the robustness of human-generated control actions. Results of a human-in-the-loop experiment indicate that expert participants were most robust in their control actions, as compared with either skilled or novice participants. This result suggests that boundary-seeking control actions with ecological interfaces are mainly dependent on the level of expertise and the control strategies of the end user.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2015.2417535","EUROCONTROL; SESAR Joint Undertaking (the SJU); European Union; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095573","Air traffic management;automation;control space robustness;ecological interface design;human–machine interaction;Air traffic management;automation;control space robustness;ecological interface design;human–machine interaction","Robustness;Aircraft;Trajectory;Aerospace control;Measurement;Visualization;Aerospace electronics","aerospace computing;air traffic control;decision support systems;ecology","expertise level;control strategies;air traffic control decision aiding;4D trajectory-based operations;human-centered decision support tools;human-centered decision aids;ecological interface design;4D trajectory management;airspace robustness preservation;average sector-based robustness;control-based robustness;human-in-the-loop experiment;boundary-seeking control actions;ecological interfaces","","8","","23","","27 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome these problems above, in this paper, we propose a Memory-based Parameterized Skills Learning (MPSL) model for mapless visual navigation. The parameterized skills in our MPSL are learned to predict critic parameters for un-trained tasks in actor-critic reinforcement learning, which can be achieved by transferring memory sequence knowledge from long short term memory network. In order to generalize into un-trained tasks, MPSL aims to capture more discriminative features by using a scene-specific layer.

Numerous factors, however, make instilling teamwork skills into deep-space astronauts extremely challenging. First, due to communication difficulties and mission duration, teams must be trained in a wide variety of domains - from maintenance procedures throughout the ship, to extremely thorough medical training, to science evaluations. Second, there may be a significant delay between when such knowledge is acquired and when it is needed; for instance, several years may pass between an astronaut learning how to diagnose, and to treat, a collapsed lung. Third, training must anticipate a huge range of conditions; the sheer length of deep-space missions when compared to shuttle missions vastly increases the number, and scope, of possible situations that could arise, making it virtually impossible to train for every scenario. To face the myriad challenges of deep-space flight, inflight training must be readily available. Our solution is a low-fidelity simulation using game-based training that leverages our experience with intelligent tutoring system (ITS) technology. Game-based training is engaging - it provides an entertaining break from the more onerous aspects of deep-space flight. Moreover, it incentivizes practice of amorphous, but critical, teamwork skills, motivating crews to practice more frequently for either mission-related team training or generalizable team skills training. Finally, a game-based solution addresses the problem of finding the physical space in which to train when a small crew is constrained in a cramped environment for extended periods of time. This paper reviews the process of creating games based on firefighting on the International Space Station (ISS) and Medical Training. We review the process of analyzing the firefighting procedure to determine the teamwork skills involved; how those skills were mapped to game mechanics; what changes were made to try to make the experience more engaging; and finally, whether these changes were effective.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500503","","Training;Games;Measurement;Teamwork;Fires;Space missions;Engines","aerospace computing;aerospace simulation;biomedical education;computer based training;intelligent tutoring systems;medical computing;serious games (computing)","serious games;knowledge retention;long-duration space missions;NASA Johnson Space Center;deep-space astronauts;maintenance procedures;ship;medical training;science evaluations;astronaut learning;deep-space missions;sheer length;low-fidelity simulation;game-based training;intelligent tutoring system;ITS technology;deep-space flight;mission-related team training;generalizable team skills training;International Space Station;ISS;firefighting procedure;teamwork skills","","3","","9","","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Working towards these goals, a master-apprentice model is presented and is evaluated during a grasping task for effectiveness and human perception. The apprenticeship model augments self-supervised learning with learning by demonstration, efficiently using the human's time and expertise while facilitating future scalability to supervision of multiple robots; the human provides demonstrations via virtual reality when the robot cannot complete the task autonomously. Experimental results indicate that the robot learns a grasping task with the apprenticeship model faster than with a solely self-supervised approach and with fewer human interventions than a solely demonstration-based approach; 100% grasping success is obtained after 150 grasps with 19 demonstrations. Preliminary user studies evaluating workload, usability, and effectiveness of the system yield promising results for system scalability and deployability. They also suggest a tendency for users to overestimate the robot's skill and to generalize its capabilities, especially as learning improves.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196754","","Robots;Grasping;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Virtual reality;Pipelines","control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-robot systems;robot programming;telerobotics;virtual reality","grasping task;human perception;human-robot master-apprentice model;virtual reality teleoperation;artificial intelligence;self-supervised learning","","1","","50","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These young people are very prompt to be influenced by technology, they are constantly immersed in smartphones, connected 24/7. This raises the question; how can we interest a well-connected student to learn programming? Some years ago, we used to have paper and pencil to teach ”algorithms” while trying to bring a quick start to programming activities on basic science and engineering. Nowadays this approach is not viable, we need to use the same tools and platforms used by the students to access social media and the Internet in general, we need to use the computer directly to show them a programming language and simple tools for development. This paper describes the main goal of this course, bring the tools a student needs from simple to complex stage, based in case study methodology. In the first sessions, students are being monitored and guided by the teacher at all times. Later on, and progressively reaching the end of the course, the students will have less time with the teachers and more independence in order to develop self-learning skills.","2375-141X","978-1-7281-4752-9","10.1109/ICVRV47840.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212918","Teaching;Programming;Algorithms;Python Computer Science Engineering","Programming;Data structures;Tools;Standards;Python;Education","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;Internet;programming;teaching","smartphones;first-year students;programming course;millennials;programming teaching;self-learning skills;programming language;social media;programming activities","","","","7","","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This student model has several advantages: flexibility, user adaptability, high modularity and facilities for model construction for different scenarios. The model keeps track of the students' knowledge at different levels of granularity, combining the performance and exploration behavior in several experiments, to decide the best way to guide the student in following experiments, and to re-categorize the students based on the results.

This problem presents a number of major challenges. Video demonstrations without teleoperation are easy for humans to provide, but do not provide any direct supervision. Learning policies from raw pixels enables full generality but calls for large function approximators with many parameters to be learned. Finally, compound tasks can require impractical amounts of demonstration data, when treated as a monolithic skill. To address these challenges, we propose a method that learns both how to learn primitive behaviors from video demonstrations and how to dynamically compose these behaviors to perform multi-stage tasks by “watching” a human demonstrator.

Using an optimum interpolation method, weekly mean various data are created from sea surface height anomaly, sea surface temperature, and subsurface temperature/salinity profiles. To consistently assimilate those data into the model, the multivariate optimum interpolation method is adopted to estimate the analysis data of temperature/salinity in vertical column. The analysis data are smoothly introduced into the model using the Incremental Analysis Update. Two months forecast run driven by the monthly mean climatological surface forcing is weekly updated.

Our method can handle these situations; we plan the continuous parameters of each subtask and skill, as well as select skills. Our method is based on stochastic differential dynamic programming. We use stochastic neural networks to learn dynamical systems when they are unknown. Our method is a form of reinforcement learning.

Participants interact using a web-interface (skype-like) developed to record videos of two participants separately and stream real-time. This platform allows interviews and group discussions to be conducted at any place without the need of colocation of all participants. Towards studying communication skill in such a setting, we collected 72 dyadic interactions of participants discussing on general topics. Manual rating of these interaction videos have been obtained from two external observers. Multimodal features related to non-verbal behavior: prosody, speaking activity, visual and verbal behavior are automatically extracted. The experimental results show that the multimodal fusion of features with reliefF feature ranking perform best with an accuracy of 74%.

The integration of optical and electronic devices to achieve lower costs and higher functionality is attractive for a wide variety of opto-electronic applications. The key to innovation at the design level for these circuits is the availability of highly skilled personnel able to take advantage of sophisticated computer aided design (CAD) platforms. These tools enable them to undertake quick iterations of the design and simulation loop. The creation of such tools will need two interrelated initiatives: 1) The development of novel simulation and modelling techniques that will enable a robust and efficient simulation capability. These capabilities will include distributed thermal effects; modeling of non-linear optical devices; and the development of robust models for simulating circuits containing resonant devices. 2) The simulation and analysis of general, large and complex mixed electro-optic circuits. An important part of the development of these tools is physically based, fast and flexible compact models for devices such as integrated lasers.

A movement that can be demonstrated well by a human may not be kinematically feasible for robot reproduction. A common approach to solve this kinematic mapping is to retarget predefined corresponding parts of the human and the robot kinematic structure. When such a correspondence is not available, manual scaling of the movement amplitude and the positioning of the demonstration in relation to the reference frame of the robot may be required. This letter's contribution is a method that eliminates both the need of human-robot structural associations-and therefore is less sensitive to the type of robot kinematics-and searches for the optimal location and adaptation of the human demonstration, such that the robot can accurately execute the optimized solution. The method defines a cost that quantifies the quality of the kinematic mapping and decreases it in conjunction with task-specific costs such as via-points and obstacles. We demonstrate the method experimentally where a real golf swing recorded via marker tracking is generalized to different speeds on the embodiment of a 7 degree-of-freedom (DoF) arm.

In this paper, game-based learning using LEGO block building is applied to improve the descriptively verbal skill. The special model, such as a half bird-half dinosaur creature or something that is not a general object, is used as the prototype model. All members of each team cannot see this model except the team leader which will describe the model information to two sub-leaders one by one. The model information will be divided into two parts for each sub-leader which will carry this information to the members of each subgroup. Finally, the finished 3D figure from all teams will be compared with the prototype model. Results show that most of them quite similar to the prototype. However, allowing the opportunity to talk with the team leader again can increase the similarity of the model.

However, the use of virtual reality tools does not provide a complete sense of realism for the trainees, so the topical problem is to develop and integrate into the training complexes various simulation systems that increase the degree of human immersion into the virtual world. In this study the problem of simulation of physical loads and realistic movement of the user in the virtual world is considered. In order to solve it, it is proposed to develop a universal software and hardware platform based on an automated treadmill, which allows organizing the user's natural movement in a virtual environment with the ability to programmatically control various movement parameters, such as speed and incline of the running belt. Thus, it is required to implement the software of the control system, as well as the algorithmic support necessary for its work for the realization of these functions. This paper considers the general scheme of functioning of the software and hardware platform, its hardware and software components, as well as the algorithm of controlling the hardware actuating elements of the platform.

We demonstrate that the algorithm selects an appropriate space for a sequence of demonstration skills on a physically realistic simulated mobile robot, and that the resulting initial policies closely match the sample trajectory.","2161-9476","978-1-4244-2661-4","10.1109/DEVLRN.2008.4640821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4640821","","Robots;Robot sensing systems;Trajectory;Visualization;Robot kinematics;Sensors;Wrist","learning (artificial intelligence);robots","sensorimotor abstraction selection;autonomous robot skill acquisition;learning;incremental algorithm;state space","","5","","13","","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To avoid major pitfalls, it is important to conduct analyses of feasibility and alternative solutions to simulation model reuse and, optimally, involve a team of experts possessing broad skill sets. Consequent investigative activities encompass the following: Gaining familiarity with model parameters and construction; Identifying difficulties in the validation of development methods and model inputs; and, Justifying the time and cost of modifying existing models to new applications. Competencies to address these challenges include the application of project management techniques; the comprehension of the intricacies inherent in simulation modeling, programming and scripting language; the ability to transform data and design appropriate statistical experiments; and when appropriate, the capacity to conduct literature research and communicate findings in the form of written technical reports and in-person presentations. Defining the elements of these wide-ranging proficiencies forms the basis of this paper which chronicles the possible reuse of four discrete-event simulation models designed to compare internal patient queueing methods in a Veterans Administration Health System specialty cardiac clinic.

Features of a learning environment do not act in isolation; other factors such as the concepts or skills to be learned, individual characteristics, the learning experience, and the interaction experience all play a role in shaping the learning process and its outcomes.

The potential users of the system can vary by their skills, expertise level, habits and psycho-motional characteristics. To make a multimodal interface user-friendly is a crucial issue. In this paper we introduce an approach to develop such an efficient, user-friendly multi-modal interaction system.

Hands-on class activities effectively convey an understanding of a complex model without equations. Computer simulations promote visual comprehensions for highly dynamic systems. In our course, general ecology for biologists, mathematical complexity is a crucial element required for transitioning from the real world to the world of numbers pertaining both linear and non-linear relationships. We designed indoor activities to initiate analytical thinking and to extend appreciations of outdoor experiences to abstract reasoning in numerical terms and computer models. Our approach fulfills the objectives of guiding biology students to construct scenarios reflecting complex interactions among organisms in the natural world. They overcame their primarily negative mindset, feeling intimidated by mathematics and uncomfortably unfamiliar with computer technology. To evaluate our teaching method, students were asked to qualitatively write an after action evaluation. They expressed enjoyment in their learning. Though struggling at times, the experience was very rewarding and worthwhile. Students came to a realization of the importance of mathematics and information literacy skills, while drawing appreciation and awareness from outdoor experiences.

However, such hands pose a major challenge for autonomous control, due to the high dimensionality of their configuration space and complex intermittent contact interactions. In this work, we propose deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) as a scalable solution for learning complex, contact rich behaviors with multi-fingered hands. Deep RL provides an end-to-end approach to directly map sensor readings to actions, without the need for task specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich manipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by directly training with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world, with minimal additional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We learn to perform a variety of tasks on two different low-cost hardware platforms entirely from scratch, and further study how the learning can be accelerated by using a small number of human demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that complex multi-fingered manipulation skills can be learned in the real world in about 4-7 hours for most tasks, and that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3 hours, indicating that direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable and practical alternative to simulation and model-based control. https:// sites.google.com/view/deeprl-handmanipulation.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794102","","Task analysis;Valves;Acceleration;Reinforcement learning;Robot sensing systems;Hardware","control engineering computing;dexterous manipulators;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;robot programming","deep reinforcement learning;multifingered hands;contact-rich manipulation behavior;model-free deep RL algorithms;complex multifingered manipulation skills;direct deep RL training;model-based control;dexterous manipulation;dexterous multifingered robotic hands;general-purpose robotic manipulators;autonomous control;complex intermittent contact interactions","","6","","30","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201889","virtual patients;simulations;serious games;non-player characters;agent-based models","Games;Medical services;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Switches;Biological neural networks","computer aided instruction;decision support systems;diseases;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;multi-agent systems;patient care;serious games (computing);teaching;virtual reality","agent-based models;nonplayer characters;serious game;medical simulations;standardized patient;healthcare professional students;clinical condition;simulated interactions;clinical decision support;patient care;simulated virtual patient;virtual patient simulation","","","","64","","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simplified models that provide tractable formulas are unrealistic in general. In this paper we explore an intermediate solution, based on an approximate continuous-time Markov chain model of the call center. This model is more accurate than the commonly used approximations, and yet can be simulated faster than a more realistic simulation (based on non-exponential distributions and additional details). To speed up the simulation, we uniformize the Markov chain and simulate only its discrete-time version. We show how performance measures such as the fraction of calls of each type answered within a given waiting time limit can be recovered from this simulation, how to synchronize common random numbers in this setting, and how to use this in the first phase of an optimization algorithm based on the cutting plane method. We also discuss various implementation issues and provide empirical results.","1558-4305","978-1-4244-2707-9","10.1109/WSC.2008.4736250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4736250","","Scheduling;Computational modeling;Internet telephony;Length measurement;Phase measurement;Time measurement;Optimization methods;Postal services;Electronic mail;Gallium nitride","call centres;continuous time systems;discrete time systems;Markov processes;scheduling;service industries","call center simulation;Markov chain uniformization;staffing optimization;scheduling optimization;continuous-time Markov chain model;discrete-time version;random numbers;cutting plane method","","2","","23","","30 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The space of possible parameter settings can be seen as a search space, and we can therefore use a Random Mutation Hill Climbing algorithm or other search methods to find the parameter settings that induce the best games. One of the hardest parts of this approach is defining a suitable fitness function. In this paper we explore the possibility of using one of a growing set of General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating the skill-depth of a game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat the effects of noise.","","978-1-5090-4601-0","10.1109/CEC.2017.7969583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7969583","Automatic game design;game tuning;optimisation;RMHC;GVG-AI","Games;Missiles;Artificial intelligence;Marine vehicles;Evolutionary computation;Optimization;Algorithm design and analysis","computer games;multi-agent systems;optimisation","game skill-depth;general video game AI agents;random mutation hill climbing algorithm;automatic play-testing;multi armed bandit random mutation hill-climber;space-battle game","","10","","24","","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To learn structured policies for continuous control, the graph neural networks (GNN) was previously applied to incorporate explicitly the robot structure into the policy network. In this work, we tackle the problem of robotic skill learning in high-dimensional state space with the help of graph neural networks. Instead of utilizing a general purpose multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a unified controller to output actions for all joints of the robot, we construct a separate controller for each joint of the robot by using the individual features that have been extracted by GNN model. Empirical results on simulated continuous systems, including applications to PR2 task and Centipede task, demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve satisfactory learning performance, and more importantly, it significantly reduces the parameters of the policy network.","1948-9447","978-1-7281-5855-6","10.1109/CCDC49329.2020.9164162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9164162","Robotic Skill Learning;Graph Neural Networks;State Decomposition","Robots;Task analysis;Aerospace electronics;Feature extraction;Training;Biological neural networks","continuous systems;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;robot programming","robotic skill learning;robotic tasks;state space;graph neural networks;robot structure;continuous control;general purpose multilayer perceptron;continuous systems","","","","28","","11 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these potential benefits may only be realized if the corresponding motion synthesis procedure is suitably flexible. This paper presents a flexible trajectory generation algorithm that utilizes a geometric representation of humanoid skills (e.g., walking) - in the form of skill manifolds. These manifolds are learnt from demonstration data that may be obtained from off-line optimization algorithms (or a human expert).We demonstrate that this model may be used to produce approximately optimal motion plans as geodesics over the manifold and that this allows us to effectively generalize from a limited training set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated 3-link planar arm, and then the more challenging example of a physical 19-DoF humanoid robot. We show that our algorithm produces a close approximation of the much more computationally intensive optimization procedure used to generate the data. This allows us to present experimental results for fast motion planning on a realistic - variable step length, width and height - walking task on a humanoid robot.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509819","","Humanoid robots;Legged locomotion;Robotics and automation;USA Councils;Informatics;Humans;Computational modeling;Approximation algorithms;Motion planning;Skeleton","differential geometry;humanoid robots;legged locomotion;motion control","geodesic trajectory generation;learnt skill manifold;humanoid robots;motion synthesis procedure;flexible trajectory generation algorithm;geometric representation;humanoid skills;off-line optimization algorithm;simulated 3-link planar arm;physical 19-DoF humanoid robot;motion planning;walking task","","3","","17","","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system in its current configuration is designed to enable distance training of students in real scenarios of robot manipulator programming. From a technological perspective, the research work presented in this paper is directed towards the adaptation of concepts and techniques developed in the field of telerobotics and virtual reality, and their integration in such e-laboratory settings. This paper focuses particularly on the educational impact of such systems. The goal is to assess the performance of e-laboratory scenarios in terms of the efficacy of training provided to students. The results of a pilot experimental study are presented, providing a comparative evaluation for three training modalities: real, remote, and virtual training on robot manipulator programming. The experiments were conducted according to an evaluation protocol specially designed for the considered target training task, using scoring charts to obtain quantitative performance measures and assess the performance of the student groups participating in the course. Training, as a dynamic process, is approached according to a classical three dimensional model, and performance scores are accordingly assessed in these dimensions (namely: low-level versus mid and high-level skills and understanding). The obtained results reveal certain differences between the three groups, particularly as related to the low-level skill training score, giving some insight about the training `dimensions' that are expected to be mostly affected by the absence of physical (or realistic virtual) presence in a real hands-on experimentation. Statistical analysis indicates, however, that, despite these apparent differences, such e-laboratory modules can be integrated quite effectively in practical scenarios, creating virtual training environments that can provide adequate learning elements, as related particularly to mid and high-level skill acquisition. Further work and large-scale studies are still needed, though, in order to explore the extent to which such a general conclusion is valid in different training settings, and to form the basis of a more theoretical evaluation for a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical differences between real, virtual, and remote learning/training methodologies and experiences","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2006.879255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668280","Distance training;evaluation methodology;remote laboratory;telerobotics;virtual robotic laboratory","Manipulators;Telerobotics;Virtual reality;Control engineering education;Statistics;Student experiments","computer based training;control engineering education;distance learning;educational courses;manipulators;statistical analysis;student experiments;telerobotics;virtual reality","virtual robotic laboratory;remote robotic laboratory;e-laboratory;distance training;robot manipulator programming;telerobotics;virtual reality;scoring charts;statistical analysis;virtual training environments;high-level skill acquisition","","103","","24","","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

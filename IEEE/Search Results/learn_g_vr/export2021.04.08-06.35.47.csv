Such non-stationary contexts may appear in many robotic tasks: in particular, the changing of the context due to the use of tools with different lengths and shapes is herein studied. We model the robot forward kinematics as a multi-valued function, in which different outputs for the same input query are related to actual different hidden contexts. To do that, we employ IMLE, a recent online learning algorithm that fits an infinite mixture of linear experts to the online stream of training data. This algorithm can directly provide multi-valued regression in a online fashion, while having, for classic single-valued regression, a performance comparable to state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. The context varying forward kinematics is learned online through exploration, not relying on any kind of prior knowledge. Using the proposed approach, the robot can dynamically learn how to use different tools, without forgetting the kinematic mappings concerning previously manipulated tools. No information is given about such tool changes to the learning algorithm, nor any assumption is made about the tool kinematics. To our knowledge this is the most general and efficient approach to learning and control under discrete varying contexts. Some experimental results obtained on a high-dimensional simulated humanoid robot provide a strong support to our approach.","1050-4729","978-1-4673-5643-5","10.1109/ICRA.2013.6631263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6631263","","Context;Robots;Training;Kinematics;Aerospace electronics;Joints;Predictive models","humanoid robots;learning systems;regression analysis;robot kinematics","nonstationary context;robotic task;robot forward kinematics;multivalued function;input query;IMLE;online learning algorithm;linear experts;online training data stream;multivalued regression;classic single-valued regression;context varying forward kinematics learning;exploration;dynamic learning;kinematic mappings;tool kinematics;switching contexts;task space control;switching tools;humanoid robot kinematics","","6","","18","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Lyapunov function candidate is derived that links the energy function and the transient stability of the integrated system with the wide-area controller. The proposed wide-area controller augments the excitation system of the synchronous generator and local Maximum Power Point (MPP) tracking control of wind generator Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The theoretical results are validated by conducting simulation studies on 2-Area Kundur power system for damping the inter-area oscillations. It was observed that the method improves transient stability of the integrated system due to the active and reactive support from the DFIG and thus damping the inter-area oscillations much faster. It was also observed that the speed oscillations of DFIG is within the limits.","1944-9933","978-1-5090-4168-8","10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7741876","Wide-Area Controller;Wind Energy;DFIG","Damping;Power system stability;Transient analysis;Oscillators;Synchronous generators","adaptive control;asynchronous generators;control system synthesis;intelligent control;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;Lyapunov methods;machine control;maximum power point trackers;optimal control;position control;power generation control;power grids;power system transient stability;synchronous generators;wind power plants","inter-area oscillations;2-area Kundur power system;DFIG;wind generator doubly fed induction generator;MPPT tracking control;local maximum power point tracking control;synchronous generator excitation system;integrated power system transient stability;Lyapunov function candidate;reinforcement learning technique;adaptive critic design;energy function based intelligent optimal controller;wind integrated power grid;wind integrated power system;direct intelligent wide-area damping controller","","5","","12","","14 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"QoS provisioning and energy saving scheme for distributed cognitive radio networks using deep learning","M. C. Hlophe; B. T.

Since future network infrastructure will host real-time services requiring immediate satisfaction, the issue of high energy consumption will hinder the full realization of CRs. This means that to offer the required quality of service (QoS) in an energy-efficient manner, resource management strategies need to allow for effective trade-offs between QoS provisioning and energy saving. To address this issue, this paper focuses on single base station (BS) management, where resource consumption efficiency is obtained by solving a dynamic resource allocation (RA) problem using bipartite matching. A deep learning (DL) predictive control scheme is used to predict the traffic load for better energy saving using a stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Considered here was a base station (BS) processor with both processor sharing (PS) and first-come-first-served (FCFS) sharing disciplines under quite general assumptions about the arrival and service processes. The workload arrivals are defined by a Markovian arrival process while the service is general. The possible impatience of customers is taken into account in terms of the required delays. In this way, the BS processor is treated as a hybrid switching system that chooses a better packet scheduling scheme between mean slowdown (MS) FCFS and MS PS. The simulation results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed predictive control scheme achieves better energy saving as the traffic load increases, and that the processing of workload using MS PS achieves substantially superior energy saving compared to MS FCFS.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143571","Bipartite matching;cognitive radio networks;deep learning;energy saving;mean slowdown;quality of service;resource allocation;resource percentage threshold;traffic prediction","Quality of service;Energy consumption;Resource management;Wireless networks;Delays","cognitive radio;control engineering computing;energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;predictive control;quality of service;queueing theory;radio networks;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication control;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","first-come-first-served sharing discipline;processor sharing discipline;stacked auto-encoder;energy saving scheme;MS PS;mean slowdown FCFS;packet scheduling scheme;BS processor;Markovian arrival process;base station processor;predictive control scheme;dynamic resource allocation problem;resource consumption efficiency;single base station management;management strategies;real-time services;future network infrastructure;high energy consumption;wireless communications;future mobile communications;deep learning;distributed cognitive radio networks;QoS provisioning","","","","","","17 Jul 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

A method of fingertip mapping is developed based on virtual fingers in Cartesian space. Using the data glove as human machine interface, joint angles are recorded and digit trajectories are computed using forward kinematics. The kinematics of movement of all digits is analyzed during grasp. In order to give an evaluation of the mapping algorithm we quantify the motion mapping results by using a general distance as a characterization of comparability between human hand and robot hand posture. Our method considers the grasping posture between all the fingers not only the fingertip positions. The fingertip trajectories during grasp are recorded in Cartesian space. A virtual environment is developed to visualize the motion of the human hand and the robot hands. Visualization of the 3D workspace is accomplished. The mapping results are verified in the virtual environment, illustrate the validity of the mapping algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1761-2","10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4522270","dexterous hands;grasp planning;master/slave manipulation;motion mapping","Humans;Robots;Orbital robotics;Motion planning;Master-slave;Fingers;Kinematics;Virtual environment;Visualization;Data gloves","data gloves;data visualisation;dexterous manipulators;manipulator kinematics;virtual reality","human hand motion mapping;dexterous robotic hand;human grasp planning;master-slave manipulation;fingertip mapping method;virtual finger;Cartesian space;data glove;human machine interface;forward kinematics;virtual environment;motion visualization","","8","","23","","16 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, a subset of the antennas of virtual wireless networks transmits pilot symbols for estimating the CSI and use the estimated CSI dataset to train and estimate the remaining channels and future CSI for virtual networks using machine learning algorithms. This helps not only to predict the CSI with least overhead and fulfills the service demands of users but also to reduce the power consumption and computation overhead in the network. Predicted CSI is leveraged for RF slicing for virtual wireless networks. Simulation results show that the proposed SBLR for predicting CSI results in lower BER and higher data rate for the wireless users.

Over time the movements and actions of these robots are likely to require modification for different scenarios and environments. Therefore being able to `teach' the robot new tasks and motions without tedious programming is highly useful. The operational space formulation is a highly elegant robot manipulator control method that has parallels with human motion strategies, with prioritization of task achievement and redundant degrees of freedom control via effort optimisation. In this paper, we combine a novel method of learning by observation with the operational space framework. This has created a learning controller that is able to generalise a small set of example reaching motions in order to reach to new targets while maintaining human like motion trajectories in the posture space via a novel sliding mode optimal controller. The trajectories are executed on a (dynamically) simulated robot arm which performs human like reaching to arbitrary locations. Trajectories are minimally encoded as the coefficients of fitted polynomials and the learning is performed by three neural networks that learn and generalise. Initial results are presented for this early stage of research on this proposed framework.","2164-0580","978-1-4244-8690-8","10.1109/ICHR.2010.5686835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5686835","","Trajectory;Humans;Joints;End effectors;Polynomials;Aerospace electronics","humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;legged locomotion;manipulator dynamics;neural nets;optimal control;optimisation;polynomials;variable structure systems","neural network;human motion;learning by observation;humanoid robot;robot manipulator;task prioritization;freedom control;effort optimisation;motion trajectory;posture space;sliding mode control;optimal control","","","","14","","13 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modeling errors in general degrade the convergence performance of NO-ILC, and hence ensuring RMC against model uncertainties is important. Although the robustness of NO-ILC has been studied in the literature, determining the allowable range of modeling errors for a given NO-ILC design is still an open research question. To fill this gap, a frequency-domain analysis with a multiplicity formulation of model uncertainty is developed in this paper to quantify and visualize the allowable modeling errors. Compared with the traditional formulation, the proposed new uncertainty formulation provides a less conservative representation of the allowable model uncertainty range by taking additional phase information into account and thus allows for a more complete evaluation of the robustness of NO-ILC. The analysis also clarifies how the RMC region changes as a function of NO-ILC weighting parameters and therefore can be used as a frequency-domain design tool to achieve RMC for given model uncertainties. Simulation examples are given to confirm the theoretical conclusions and demonstrate the utility of the developed analysis.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2017.2692729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7926339","Frequency-domain analysis;norm-optimal iterative learning control (NO-ILC);robust monotonic convergence (RMC)","Uncertainty;Frequency-domain analysis;Robustness;Convergence;Analytical models;Tools;Asymptotic stability","control system analysis;control system synthesis;convergence;frequency-domain analysis;iterative methods;learning systems;linear systems;robust control;uncertain systems","general degrade the convergence performance;allowable range;NO-ILC design;allowable modeling errors;uncertainty formulation;allowable model uncertainty range;RMC region changes;NO-ILC weighting parameters;frequency-domain design tool;developed analysis;model uncertainties;single-input-single-output linear time-invariant systems;norm-optimal iterative learning control;robust monotonic convergence;frequency-domain analysis","","7","","29","","11 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a general approach to playing video games, this has many inviting properties: no need for specialized modifications to the game, no lengthy training sessions and the ability to re-use the same tools across different games. However, related work includes game-specific engineering to achieve the results. We take a step towards a general approach and study the general applicability of behavioural cloning on twelve video games, including six modern video games (published after 2010), by using human demonstrations as training data.

In this developmental context, we investigate here the use of the recently proposed PICMAES2 episodic reinforcement learning algorithm, which is able to learn high-dimensional motor tasks through adaptive control of exploration. By studying PICMAES2 in a reaching task on a simulated arm, we observe two developmental properties. First, we show how PICMAES2 autonomously and continuously tunes the global exploration/exploitation tradeoff, allowing it to re-adapt to changing tasks. Second, we show how PICMAES2 spontaneously self-organizes a maturational structure whilst exploring the degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of the motor space. In particular, it automatically demonstrates the so-called proximo-distal maturation observed in humans: after first freezing distal DOFs while exploring predominantly the most proximal DOF, it progressively frees exploration in DOFs along the proximo-distal body axis. These emergent properties suggest the use of PICMAES2 as a general tool for studying reinforcement learning of skills in life-long developmental learning contexts.","2161-9476","978-1-4673-4965-9","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400586","","Joints;Covariance matrix;Robots;Trajectory;Vectors;Acceleration;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);robots","emergent proximo distal maturation;adaptive exploration;robot learning;structured exploration mechanisms;reinforcement learning algorithm;degrees-of-freedom;DOF;motor space","","5","","22","","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This enables the use of general function approximators to approximate the linearizing controller for the system without having to worry about singularities. The overall learning system is stochastic, due to the random nature of the policy gradient updates, thus we combine analysis techniques commonly employed in the machine learning literature alongside stability arguments from adaptive control to demonstrate that with high probability the tracking and parameter errors concentrate near zero, under a standard persistency of excitation condition.

In general, compressive sensing techniques leverage the assumption of sparsity of the wideband spectrum to recover the spectrum by solving a set of ill-posed linear equations. In this paper, we adopt the framework of a generative adversarial neural network (GAN) in deep learning and propose a deep compressive spectrum sensing GAN (DCSS-GAN), where two neural networks are trained to compete with each other to recover the spectrum from undersampled samples in the time domain. The proposed DCSS-GAN is a data-driven learning approach that does not require a priori statistics about the radio environment. In addition, it is an end-to-end algorithm that directly recovers the information of spectrum occupancy from raw samples and without the need of energy detection. Various simulations show that the proposed DCSS-GAN has a 12.3% to 16.2% performance gain on prediction accuracy at a 1/8th compression ratio compared to the conventional LASSO approach.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149195","","Sensors;Training;Generators;Wideband;Neural networks;Gallium nitride;Cognitive radio","cognitive radio;compressed sensing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio spectrum management;signal detection;signal sampling;telecommunication computing","secondary user;wideband spectrum;sub-Nyquist sampling rate;ill-posed linear equations;generative adversarial neural network;deep learning;deep compressive spectrum sensing GAN;DCSS-GAN;neural networks;radio environment;end-to-end algorithm;spectrum occupancy;cognitive radio networks;end-to-end deep learning-based compressive spectrum sensing;data-driven learning approach;energy detection","","","","18","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To obtain greater visibility into its diagnostic reasoning, the eStudent is trained to create an external representation of its reasoning about the current problem - a diagnostic rationale. This includes describing potential problems, hypothesizing possible events and states, positing possible causal explanations as rationale assertions, seeking evidence for or against these assertions, projecting possible risks, and using possible risks to focus attention when developing a rationale.

Fuzzy logic systems have been successfully applied to deal with traffic-control-related problems and have provided a robust mathematical framework for dealing with real-world imprecision. However, there is no clear and general technique to map domain knowledge on traffic control onto the parameters of a fuzzy logic system. Neural networks have learning and adaptive capabilities that can be used to construct intelligent computational algorithms for traffic control. However, the knowledge embodied in conventional methods is difficult to incorporate into the design of neural networks. The proposed neural fuzzy connection admission control (NFCAC) scheme is an integrated method that combines the linguistic control capabilities of a fuzzy logic controller and the learning abilities of a neural network. It is an intelligent implementation so that it can provide a robust framework to mimic experts' knowledge embodied in existing traffic control techniques and can construct efficient computational algorithms for traffic control. We properly choose input variables and design the rule structure for the NFCAC controller so that it can have robust operation even under dynamic environments. Simulation results show that compared with a conventional effective-bandwidth-based CAC, a fuzzy-logic-based CAC, and a neural-net-based CAC, the proposed NFCAC can achieve superior system utilization, high learning speed, and simple design procedure, while keeping the QoS contract.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.759332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=759332","","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Traffic control;Neural networks;Fuzzy neural networks;Admission control;Computational intelligence;Robust control;High-speed networks;Communication system traffic control","quality of service;telecommunication congestion control;fuzzy logic;feedforward neural nets;multimedia communication;telecommunication traffic;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;neural net architecture","QoS-provisioning;neural fuzzy connection admission controller;multimedia high-speed networks;QoS guarantee;fuzzy logic systems;traffic control;intelligent computational algorithms;integrated method;linguistic control;learning abilities;input variables;rule structure;simulation results;effective-bandwidth-based CAC;fuzzy-logic-based CAC;neural-net-based CAC;NFCAC;high learning speed","","61","1","22","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The issue requires that mobile network income be optimized while simultaneously satisfying QoS constraints that prevent getting into specific states and utilization of specific actions. However, supporting QoS requirements of different traffic types is more complicated due to the need to minimize two performance indicators - the probability of discarding a handover call and the probability of hindering a new call. Several approaches proposed recently try to provide efficient model-based solution to the problem by formulating it as an average reward neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) optimization problem together with decomposition function, but this is limited by Bellman's curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid optimization scheme to address the problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Markov Decision Process (MDP) and adaptive joint call admission control (AJCAC) respectively. In the proposed scheme, two classes of arrival traffic at the base station (BS) are considered; voice (real-time) and data (non-real-time) calls. Furthermore, traffic is classified as new and handoff according to the type of request. The scheme introduces an adaptive threshold value, which dynamically adjusts the network resources under high traffic intensity.

The most common choice of cost function is the sum of squares (SS). An alternative choice of cost function is the log likelihood (LL). An analytical comparison of the SS and LL has suggested that the latter should lead to improved generalization when a multilayer perception trained on non-separable data by back-propagation. This is confirmed by results from simulated data, where the LL-trained networks result in a significant reduction in test-set errors. Moreover, a good generalizing solution appears to be achievable in fewer iterations, with a smaller network, or with fewer training samples.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=263737","","","iterative methods;learning systems;neural nets","neural network training;multi-layer perceptrons;log-likelihood cost function;synaptic weights;iterative algorithm;sum of squares;analytical comparison;non-separable data;back-propagation;test-set errors;fewer iterations;smaller network;fewer training samples","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Then, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework to estimate the model parameters of the sparse virtual channel. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to reduce complexity. Specifically, the factor graph and the general approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithms are used to compute the desired posterior statistics in the expectation step, so that high-dimensional integrals over the marginal distributions can be avoided. The non-zero supporting vector of the virtual channel is then obtained from channel statistics by a k-means clustering algorithm. After that, the reduced dimensional GAMP-based scheme is designed to make the full use of the channel temporal correlation so as to enhance the virtual channel tracking accuracy.

This paper studies the issues of quality of service (QoS) provisioning in such systems. In particular, call admission control and bandwidth adaptation are formulated as a constrained Markov decision problem. The rapid growth in the number of states and the difficulty in estimating state transition probabilities in practical systems make it very difficult to employ classical methods to find the optimal policy. We present a novel approach that uses a form of discounted reward reinforcement learning known as Q-learning to solve QoS provisioning for wireless adaptive multimedia. Q-learning does not require the explicit state transition model to solve the Markov decision problem, therefore more general and realistic assumptions can be applied to the underlying system model for this approach than in the previous schemes. Moreover, the proposed scheme can efficiently handle the large state space and action set of the wireless adaptive multimedia QoS provisioning problem. Handoff dropping probability and average allocated bandwidth are considered as QoS constraints in our model and can be guaranteed simultaneously.

In this new setting, the aim is to design some suitable adaptive pinning controllers on the chosen nodes of each followers' subnetwork, such that the nodes in each subnetwork can be exponentially synchronized onto their reference state. Then, some cluster synchronization criteria for multiple nonlinearly coupled dynamical subnetworks of complex networks are established, and a pinning control scheme that the nodes with very large or low degrees are good candidates for applying pinning controllers is presented.

Normally, network traffic usually needs to pass through several VNFs in a particular order. This phenomenon is known as Service Function Chaining (SFC). How to place SFCs with minimal resource is still an open problem. Most of the existing work thinks it's difficult to find the placement solution for all SFCs as a whole, they, instead, consider each demand sequentially, and deploy SFCs one by one. But such serial placement lacks consideration of the interrelations among demands and unable to minimize resource. In this paper, we innovatively propose a parallel deployment scheme based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). It satisfies demands with minimum resource. We design an overall SFC placement scheme for all demands, and deploy all SFCs simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using extensive simulations and prototype experiments. The result demonstrates that our parallel deployment approach minimized resource costs compared with other schemes.","","978-1-7281-4743-7","10.1109/ICCC47050.2019.9064448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064448","NFV;SFC;DRL;Parallel Placement","Servers;Resource management;Bandwidth;Machine learning;Network function virtualization;Noise measurement","computer network management;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication services;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","virtual network functions;deep reinforcement learning;hardware middle-boxes;parallel deployment approach;SFC placement scheme;parallel deployment scheme;serial placement;service function chaining;network traffic;general-purpose servers;service flexibility;network function virtualization;parallel placement approach","","","","13","","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike most previous approaches on saturated systems, which assumed affine nonlinear systems, in this paper, tracking control problem is solved for uncertain nonaffine nonlinear systems with input saturation. To deal with the saturation constraint, an auxiliary system is constructed and a modified tracking error is defined. Then, by employing implicit function theorem, mean value theorem, and modified tracking error, updating rules are derived based on the well-known back-propagation (BP) algorithm, which has been proven to be the most relevant updating rule to control problems. However, most of the previous approaches on BP algorithm suffer from lack of stability analysis. By injecting a damping term to the standard BP algorithm, uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the signals of the closed-loop system is ensured via Lyapunov's direct method. Furthermore, the presented approach employs nonlinear in parameter neural networks. Hence, the proposed scheme is applicable to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearity. Using a high-gain observer to reconstruct the states of the system, an output feedback controller is also presented.

Here, the continuous controllers are originally designed by using the control theory in the linear time-invariant (LTI) continuous-time setting, while the neural algorithms approximate the input/output behavior of the continuous controllers through deep learning. Then, stability problem of the hybrid feedback system is formulated as that of a corresponding LTI feedback system subject to nonlinear perturbation in term of learning error. Stability conditions in bounded-input/bounded-output (BIBO) are proved. In general, when stability robustness is concerned, the suggested stability conditions show that the learning error should be as small as possible. To illustrate the theoretical results, a continuous-time PID controller being replaced with a deep belief network (DBN) controller in a DC-motor system is stimulated. That is, the input/output time responses of the PID controller are used as the training data and target data, respectively, for creating the DBN controller. This yields an DC-motor feedback system based on DBN-driving control strategy. Numerical simulations and comparisons of the DC-motor system under the PID controller and under the suggested DBN one validate the expected performances and high efficacy.","","978-1-5386-3524-7","10.1109/CAC.2017.8243110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8243110","neural network control;deep learning;deep belief network;PID controller;hybrid control system","Machine learning;Stability analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Biological neural networks;Linear systems;Numerical stability","adaptive control;belief networks;continuous time systems;control system synthesis;DC motors;discrete time systems;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);linear systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;robust control;stability criteria;three-term control;time-varying systems","linear continuous-time systems;deep belief network controller;hybrid feedback control systems;continuous controllers;neural-network controllers;control theory;linear time-invariant continuous-time setting;deep learning;stability problem;hybrid feedback system;learning error;bounded-input/bounded-output;stability robustness;continuous-time PID controller;DC-motor system;input/output behavior;stability conditions;LTI feedback system;DBN-driving control strategy;DC-motor feedback system;DBN controller;input/output time responses","","1","","19","","1 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, the task space representation provides a first generalization, for example wrt. differing absolute positions, if bi-manual movements are represented in relation to each other. Although task spaces are widely used, even if they are not mentioned explicitly, they are mostly defined a priori. This work is a step towards an automatic selection of task spaces. Observed movements are mapped into a pool of possibly even conflicting task spaces and we present methods that analyze this task space pool in order to acquire task space descriptors that match the observation best. As statistical measures cannot explain importance for all kinds of movements, the presented selection scheme incorporates additional criteria such as an attention-based measure. Further, we introduce methods that make a significant step from purely statistically-driven task space selection towards model-based movement analysis using a simulation of a complex human model. Effort and discomfort of the human teacher is being analyzed and used as a hint for important task elements.

For a preliminary demonstration of these concepts, a simulation in which a two-link manipulator is taught how to make a tennis-like swing has been constructed. The control system first determines how to make a successful swing using rules alone. It then teaches a neural network how to accomplish the task by having the network observe and generalize on rule-based task execution. Following initial training, a rule-based execution monitor evaluates the neural network performance and reengages rule-based swing-maneuver control whenever errors due to changes in the manipulator or its operating environment necessitate retraining of the network. The rule-based system thereby ensures proper task completion while neural network relearning takes place. The simulation shows the interaction between rule-based and network-based system components during various phases of training and supervision.<>","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=118652","","Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Neural networks;Robots","knowledge based systems;learning systems;neural nets;robots","robots;knowledge-based system;neural network;autonomous learning machines;rule-based system;two-link manipulator;swing-maneuver control","","5","2","23","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads. The dyads experiment in a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) scenario to move an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment to reach predefined goal configurations. In this study, we propose a sliding-window approach for feature extraction and demonstrate the online classification methodology to identify interaction patterns. We evaluate our approach using 1) a support vector machine classifier (SVMc) and 2) a Gaussian Process classifier (GPc) for multi-class classification, and achieve over 80% accuracy with both classifiers when identifying general interaction types.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2945261","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854968","Classification;Feature Extraction;Force and Tactile Sensing;Haptics and Haptic Interfaces;Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop;Learning and Adaptive Systems;Physical Human-Human Interaction;Physical Human-Robot Interaction;Recognition","Task analysis;Collaboration;Haptic interfaces;Feature extraction;Robots;Microsoft Windows;Taxonomy","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;image classification;robot vision;support vector machines;virtual reality","interaction state;physical interactions;interaction patterns;physical human-human interaction;general interaction types;interaction behaviors;collaborative object transfer;joint object transfer;online identification;haptic data;industrial settings;object co-manipulation;haptics-enabled virtual environment;sliding-window approach;feature extraction;online classification methodology;support vector machine classifier;SVMc;Gaussian process classifier;multiclass classification;general interaction type identification;automatic classification mechanism","","","","27","IEEE","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally speaking, routing enables Secondary Users (SUs) to select optimal routes, while minimizing interference to Primary Users (PUs), which is a key requirement of CRNs. Nevertheless, there has been limited research in the literature for routing schemes that consider both SUs' interference to PUs and network-wide performance of SUs. This paper proposes a novel Cognitive Radio Q-routing (CRQ-routing) scheme, which aims to take account of SU-to-PU interference and SUs' end-to-end delay. Traditionally, routing schemes have been designed for specific applications and may not achieve the optimum network-wide performance in most kinds of network scenarios. In this paper, CRQ-routing has been shown to achieve network-wide performance in scenarios with various levels of channel dynamicity and unpredictability in regards to PU activities. Furthermore, CRQ-routing is simple to implement since it does not require additional hardware or geographical information. Basically, CRQ-routing is a Reinforcement Learning- (RL-) based approach that provides intelligence to SUs so that they can learn to make dynamic and efficient routing decisions on the fly while addressing the important characteristics of CRNs namely, dynamicity and unpredictability of channel availability, and SUs' interference to PUs. Simulation results show that CRQ-routing reduces the interference to PUs for up to 43% compared to traditional routing schemes, and it achieves lower end-to-end delay under highly unpredictable PU activities.","","978-1-4673-5903-0","10.1109/CICommS.2013.6582850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6582850","cognitive radio;routing;reinforcement learning;Q-routing","Routing;Delays;Interference;Standards;Availability;Computational modeling;Cognitive radio","cognitive radio;delays;interference suppression;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;wireless channels","interference minimization;primary user;cognitive radio network;reinforcement learning approach;channel availability;CRN;routing selection scheme;secondary user;SU;PU;network-wide performance;CRQ-routing scheme;cognitive radio Q-routing scheme;end-to-end delay;RL","","5","","29","","22 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems form part of the vast world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) nowadays called more properly Artificial Sciences (AS). Artificial Sciences means those sciences for which an understanding of natural and/or cultural processes is achieved by the recreation of those processes through automatic models. In particular, Natural Computation tries to construct automatic models of complex processes, using the local interaction of elementary micro-processes, simulating the original process functioning. Such models organize themselves in space and time and connect in a non-linear way to the global process they are part of, trying to reproduce the complexity through the dynamic creation of specific and independent local rules that transform themselves in relation to the dynamics of the process. Natural Computation constitutes the alternative to Classical Computation (CC). This one, in fact, has great difficulty in facing natural/cultural processes, especially when it tries to impose external rules to understand and reproduce them, trying to formalize these processes in an artificial model. In Natural Computation ambit, Artificial Adaptive Systems are theories which generative algebras are able to create artificial models simulating natural phenomenon. The learning and growing process of the models is isomorphic to the natural process evolution, that is, it's itself an artificial model comparable with the origin of the natural process. We are dealing with theories adopting the ""time of development"" of the model as a formal model of ""time of process"" itself. Artificial Adaptive Systems comprise Evolutive Systems and Learning Systems. Artificial Neural Networks are the more diffused and best-known Learning Systems models in Natural Computation. For this reason we present in this paper an application of new Artificial Adaptive Systems to a very hard and pragmatic topic: drug trafficking. That because we think that ""real world"" is often the best theory.","","978-1-4244-2351-4","10.1109/NAFIPS.2008.4531358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531358","","Adaptive systems;Computational modeling;Artificial intelligence;Cultural differences;Learning systems;Taxonomy;Algebra;Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Drugs","adaptive systems;artificial intelligence;learning systems;neural nets","artificial adaptive systems;artificial intelligence;artificial sciences;natural computation;generative algebras;evolutive systems;learning systems;artificial neural networks","","1","","50","","28 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DCL systems learn only if the competing neurons change their competitive signal. Signal-velocity information provides unsupervised local reinforcement during learning. The sign of the neuronal signal derivative rewards winners and punishes losers. Standard competitive learning ignores instantaneous win-rate information. Synaptic fan-in vectors adaptively quantize the randomly sampled pattern space into nearest-neighbor decision classes. More generally, the synaptic-vector distribution estimates the unknown sampled probability density function p(x).

They can be used to extend wired networks coverage allowing connectivity anytime and anywhere. However, WMNs may suffer from drastic performance degradation (e.g., increased packet loss ratio and delay) because of interferences and congestion. Generally, the network may be unexpectedly congested at one or more gateways (GWs) since their number is limited and most traffic is oriented to/from Internet and passes through them. In this paper, we propose a combination between a selective gateway scheme and an adaptive routing scheme in WMNs, called SGRL (Selective Gateway and Reinforcement Learning-based routing). SGRL (1) considers a probabilistic gateway selection strategy to avoid route flapping which improves network stability and traffic fairness between gateways and (2) adaptively learns an optimal routing policy taking into account multiple metrics, such as loss ratio, interference ratio and load at the gateways.

To tackle this difficulty, a PRNN that consists of a number of simpler small-scale recurrent neural network (RNN) modules with less computational complexity is conducted to introduce the best nonlinear approximation capability into the minimum mean-squared error predictor model in order to accurately predict the future behavior of MPEG video traffic in a relatively short time period based on adaptive learning for each module from previous measurement data, in order to provide faster and more accurate control action to avoid the effects of excessive load situation. Since those modules of PRNN can be performed simultaneously in a pipelined parallelism fashion, this would lead to a significant improvement in the total computational efficiency of PRNN. In order to further improve the convergence performance of the adaptive algorithm for PRNN, a learning-rate annealing schedule is proposed to accelerate the adaptive learning process. Another advantage of the PRNN-based predictor is its generalization from learning that is useful for learning a dynamic environment for MPEG video traffic prediction in ATM networks where observations may be incomplete, delayed, or partially available. The PRNN-based predictor presented in this paper is shown to be promising and practically feasible in obtaining the best adaptive prediction of real-time MPEG video traffic.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.611161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=611161","","Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks;Pipeline processing;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Autoregressive processes;Signal processing;Computational complexity;Error correction;Communication system traffic control","asynchronous transfer mode;code standards;telecommunication standards;recurrent neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);prediction theory;pipeline processing;telecommunication computing;autoregressive moving average processes;least mean squares methods;computational complexity;multimedia communication;simulated annealing;adaptive systems;telecommunication traffic;visual communication;video coding","optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction;modeling;MPEG video;ATM networks;pipelined recurrent neural networks;adaptive traffic prediction;general nonlinear autoregressive moving average process;minimum mean-squared error predictor;NARMA model;video traffic signal;small-scale recurrent neural network modules;computational complexity;adaptive learning;excessive load;computational efficiency;convergence performance;learning-rate annealing schedule;dynamic environment","","55","1","27","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although it provides a more immersive experience of the visual content, it also introduces additional burden for viewers, awkward interfaces to navigate the video lead to suboptimal viewing experiences. Virtual cinematography is an appealing direction to remedy these problems, but conventional methods are limited to virtual environments or rely on hand-crafted heuristics. We propose a new algorithm for virtual cinematography that automatically controls a virtual camera within a 360° video. Compared to the state of the art, our algorithm allows more general camera control, avoids redundant outputs, and extracts its output videos substantially more efficiently.

To design the TurboNet, the original iterative structure is unfolded as deep neural network (DNN) decoding units, where trainable weights are introduced to the max-log-MAP algorithm and optimized through supervised learning. To efficiently train the TurboNet, a loss function is carefully designed to prevent tricky gradient vanishing issue.

However, the arrival process of a heavy-tailed flow is far more bursty than that of a light-tailed flow. In addition, flows having a similar tail distribution also require distinct QoSs. This is a NP-hard problem in general. We propose a scheduling scheme that consists of two separate and parallel algorithms, including dynamic-weight-earliest-deadline-first (DWEDF) and reinforcement learning (RL), called DWEDF- RL, to address it. Specifically, we provide delay-bound-based fairness to flows having similar tail distributions in intra-queue buffering process with DWEDF. Inter-queue scheduling process further maximizes the QoS provisioning efficiency by dynamically prioritizing light-tailed flows according to network environments and QoS requirements via reinforcement learning.

It uses the most efficient two-dimensional processor connections implemented by the VLSI technology to date and also has even greater expandability of performance and capacity of neurocomputers. The authors define the general neuron model that is the basis of the toroidal lattice architecture. Then they take a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a typical example of neural networks and describe the simulation of the MLP using error backpropagation learning algorithms on virtual processors with the toroidal lattice architecture. Then, mapping from the virtual processors to physical node processors with the same toroidal lattice architecture is done by row and column partitions. At the same time, the row and column permutations are carried out for node-processor load balancing.

Most existing works make the plan by solving optimization problems, which require high computational complexity when the number of users is large and the prediction window in long. In this paper, we design a deep neural network (DNN), which contains an autoencoder and a fully-connected neural network, to learn the resource allocation pattern in a prediction window.

In our proposed method, a virtual reality-based hand tracking controller known as Leap motion controller (LMC) has introduced to track the continuous motion of the hands. LMC provides a skeletal model of the hand with appropriate data of hand position, orientation, rotation, fingertips, grabbing and more non-linear features. This controller preprocessed all the motion features and provides error free data. This machine calibrates with the environment and builds a virtual hand in a space. LMC also calculates the rotation, orientation, and textures from hands to determine and to extract hand gesture. In the next process, an efficient method is established to proceed a sequence of frames for positional hand gestures and summarize them to a shorter and more generalized sequence of lines and curves which are added to a Hidden Markov Model. For each sign of expression, we considered a start and an end point of state and segmented the state transitions into segmented HMM. In the segmentation, we assumed the state scope of the hidden variables is discrete. The transition probabilities controlled the way of hidden state at a distinct time. If there is a histogram difference in any state, the transition state moved to new frame to achieve a new sign expression. If there is no hand gesture in the frame, the state has ended by moving to the end point of the model. In the end point, we evaluated the desired hand gesture for recognition. After evaluation, hand gesture data set are proceeded over the convolutional neural network (CNN) and built a decision network. Each neuron is built up by calculating the dot product of extracted features in the dataset. In CNN, a single vector of hand gesture data is received and connected through a series of hidden layers and in the end point computed as a single vector loss function. Each feature is considered as a hidden layer. Determining the least loss function, the network recognizes the expected sign expression. In our experiment, we considered training data first to create the neurons in our network as a supervised way. We achieved significant results from our basic sign expressions in a 3% rate of error where without distortion the rate reduced to 2%. This is an enormous achievement in the Bangla sign language recognition method.","","978-1-5090-6106-8","10.1109/ICICICT1.2017.8342533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8342533","Bangla Sign Language Recognition;Hidden Markov model;Convolution neural network;leap motion controller","Thumb;Hidden Markov models;Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Bones;Feature extraction","computer vision;convolution;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;gesture recognition;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);motion control;object detection;sign language recognition;virtual reality","LMC;skeletal model;hand position;motion features;error free data;positional hand gestures;shorter sequence;Hidden Markov Model;end point;state transitions;state scope;hidden state;transition state;desired hand gesture;hand gesture data;convolutional neural network;decision network;hidden layer;basic sign expressions;Bangla sign language recognition method;virtual reality;Leap motion controller;continuous motion;virtual hands;generalized sequence;sign expression;BdSL recognition;CNN","","","","19","","23 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The practice of HCTS continues to grow at rapid pace throughout all of the healthcare disciplines, however research in this field still in its early stage. Increasingly, decision makers and developer look forward to offer more sophisticated, much larger, and more complex HCTS to serve the desired outcome and improve the quality and safety of patient care. Due to the rapidly increasing usage of personal mobile devices and the need of executing HCTS applications in environments that have no previous network infrastructure available, Mobile Health Care Training-based System (MHCTS) is an expected future trend. In such systems, medical staff will share and collaborate in a 3D virtual environment through their mobile devices in an ad-hoc network (MANET) in order to accomplish specific missions' typically surgical emergency room. Users are organized into various groups (Radiologists, Maternity departments, and General surgery etc.), and need to be managed by a multicast scheme to save network bandwidth and offer immersive sense. MHCTS are sensitive to networking issues, since interactive 3D graphics requires additional load due to the use of mobile devices. Therefore, we need to emphasize on the importance and the improvement of multicast techniques for the effectiveness of MHCTS and the management of collaborative group interaction. Research so far has devoted little attention to the network communication protocols design of such systems which is crucial to preserve the sense of immersion for participating users. In this paper, we investigate the effect of multicast routing protocol in advancing the field of Health care Training-based System to the benefit of patient's safety, and health care professional. A comprehensive analysis about various ad-hoc multicast routing protocols is proposed. The selection key factors for the right protocol for MHCTS applications were safety and robustness.

Based on system dynamics, canonical parametric models require ad hoc derivations and sometimes simplification for a computable solution; on the other hand, due to the lack of prior knowledge in the system's structure, modern nonparametric models in machine learning face the curse of dimensionality, especially in learning large systems. In this paper, we bridge this gap by unifying the theories of Lagrangian systems and vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We reformulate Lagrangian systems with kernels that embed the governing Euler-Lagrange equation-the Lagrangian kernels-and show that these kernels span a subspace capturing the Lagrangian's projection as inverse dynamics. By such property, our model uses only inputs and outputs as in machine learning and inherits the structured form as in system dynamics, thereby removing the need for the mundane derivations for new systems as well as the generalization problem in learning from scratches. In effect, it learns the system's Lagrangian, a simpler task than directly learning the dynamics. To demonstrate, we applied the proposed kernel to identify the robot inverse dynamics in simulations and experiments. Our results present a competitive novel approach to identifying Lagrangian systems, despite using only inputs and outputs.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2501842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349197","Lagrangian systems;system identification;vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space","Kernel;Yttrium;Computational modeling;Hilbert space;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Correlation","Hilbert spaces;learning systems;robot dynamics","vector-valued RKHS;Lagrangian systems modeling;multiple degrees of freedom;system dynamics;canonical parametric models;ad hoc derivations;nonparametric models;machine learning;curse of dimensionality;vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space;Euler-Lagrange equation;Lagrangian kernels;Lagrangian projection;robot inverse dynamics;learning system","","5","","43","","8 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method combines the benefits of programming by human demonstration for teaching appropriate grasps with those of automatic 3D shape segmentation for object recognition and semantic modeling. The work is motivated by important studies on human manipulation suggesting that when an object is perceived for grasping it is first parsed in its constituent parts. Following these findings we present a manipulation planning system capable of grasping objects by their parts which learns new tasks from human demonstration. The central advantage over previous approaches is the use of a topological method for shape segmentation enabling both object retrieval and part-based grasp planning according to the affordances of an object. Manipulation tasks are demonstrated in a virtual reality environment using a data glove. After the learning phase, each task is planned and executed in a robot environment that is able to generalize to similar, but previously unknown, objects.","1050-4729","978-1-61284-385-8","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5979632","","Planning;Robots;Shape;Grasping;Humans;Three dimensional displays;Solid modeling","data gloves;image retrieval;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;object recognition;planning (artificial intelligence);solid modelling;task analysis;topology;virtual reality","part-based robot grasp planning;human demonstration;appropriate grasps teaching;automatic 3D shape segmentation;object recognition;semantic modeling;human manipulation;manipulation planning system;grasping objects;topological method;object retrieval;part-based grasp planning;manipulation tasks;virtual reality environment;data glove;learning phase;robot environment","","31","","30","","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this problem, authors present a novel technique that allows developers to create remote labs in a quick, didactical, and straightforward way. This framework is based on the use of two well-known software tools in the scope of engineering education, Easy Java Simulations and LabVIEW. The development exploits a new feature of Easy Java Simulations known as EJS-elements that enables Java developers to create and integrate their own authoring libraries (elements) into EJS, thus increasing its application possibilities. Particularly, the EJS element here presented allows to LabVIEW programs be controlled from EJS applications through a communication network. This paper presents the element creation details and how this can be used to create web-enabled experimentation environments for educational purposes.

In this context, the solution is to employ smart Radio Resource Management (RRM) in general and innovative packet scheduling in particular in order to offer high flexibility and cope with both current and upcoming QoS challenges. Given the increasing demand for bandwidth-hungry applications, conventional scheduling strategies face significant problems in meeting the heterogeneous QoS requirements of various application classes under dynamic network conditions. This paper proposes 5MART, a 5G smart scheduling framework that manages the QoS provisioning for heterogeneous traffic. Reinforcement learning and neural networks are jointly used to find the most suitable scheduling decisions based on current networking conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed 5MART framework can achieve up to 50% improvement in terms of time fraction (in sub-frames) when the heterogeneous QoS constraints are met with respect to other state-of-the-art scheduling solutions.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2960849","European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme for the NEWTON project; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Research Centres Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936987","5G;radio resource management;machine learning;scheduling;traffic prioritization;QoS optimization","Quality of service;Frequency-domain analysis;5G mobile communication;Delays;Time-domain analysis;Dynamic scheduling","5G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","5G SMART scheduling framework;reinforcement learning;mobile data traffic;quality of service;anticipated 5G networks;smart Radio Resource Management;general packet scheduling;bandwidth-hungry applications;heterogeneous QoS requirements;dynamic network conditions;QoS provisioning;heterogeneous traffic;neural networks;5MART framework;RRM","","","","28","IEEE","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In each time step, the success of attempted transmissions depends on interference conditions, which are captured by an interference model (e.g., the SINR model). Additionally, an adversarial jammer can render a (1-δ)-fraction of time steps in a time window unsuccessful. For this scenario, we analyze a framework for distributed no-regret learning algorithms to get provable approximation guarantees. We obtain an O(1/δ)-approximation for the problem of maximizing the number of successful transmissions. Our approach provides even a constant-factor approximation when the jammer exactly blocks a (1-δ)-fraction of time steps. In addition, we consider the parameters of the jammer being partially unknown to the algorithm, and we also consider a stochastic jammer, for which we obtain a constant-factor approximation after a polynomial number of time steps. We extend our results to more general settings, in which links arrive and depart dynamically, and where each sender tries to reach multiple receivers.

Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201889","virtual patients;simulations;serious games;non-player characters;agent-based models","Games;Medical services;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Switches;Biological neural networks","computer aided instruction;decision support systems;diseases;health care;medical computing;medical information systems;multi-agent systems;patient care;serious games (computing);teaching;virtual reality","agent-based models;nonplayer characters;serious game;medical simulations;standardized patient;healthcare professional students;clinical condition;simulated interactions;clinical decision support;patient care;simulated virtual patient;virtual patient simulation","","","","64","","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four related institutions were selected in this study: Taman Tamadun Islam (TTI) and Architectural Museum Malaysia (AMM) which display architectural wonders of past civilizations by means of large replicas; as well as National Museum (NM) and Museum of History and Ethnography (MHE) which are dedicated to safeguarding and preserving the national heritage and history. TTI and NM have adequate general information technology infrastructure and digital exhibits are installed in their exhibition halls. AMM and MHE have less digital exhibits and most exhibits consist of a mixture of posters, artefacts, and replica. During this study, a survey was conducted by means of interview with 311 respondents who are also visitors to these four institutions. The findings of this study suggest most visitors perceived the use of IDE in general will allow easy access to information on national history and cultural heritage. They recommended IDE to be used as interpretation methods in order to make national history and cultural heritage more attractive. Interestingly, when it comes to available exhibition techniques, visitors vary their preferences on IDE over traditional means of exhibits according to the nature of these institutions. These findings reflect that museum visitors welcome the use of IDE and nevertheless appreciate the aesthetic values of real artefacts.","","978-1-4799-6242-6","10.1109/ICT4M.2014.7020664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020664","Interactive digital exhibits;Learning experience;Museum experience;Interactive museum","Decision support systems","exhibitions;history;museums;psychology;virtual reality","visitor perception;interactive digital exhibits;history;IDE;visitor learning experience;cultural heritage institutions;historical institutions;Taman Tamadun Islam;Architectural Museum Malaysia;National Museum;Museum of IListory and Ethnography;NM;national heritage;TTI;information technology infrastructure;exhibition halls;AMM;MILE","","","","14","","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Domain Randomization is applied to capture the pushing trajectories of a generalized class of objects. When executed on the real robot, the trained recursive model adapts to the tracked object's real dynamics within a few steps. We propose the algorithm Recurrent Model Predictive Path Integral (RMPPI) as a variation of the original MPPI approach, employing state-dependent recurrent models. As a comparison, we also train a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) network as a model-free baseline, which is also used as the action generator in the data collection phase.

We present a novel heuristic approach to this problem based on the concept of learning automata in fuzzy environments. We call these automata the F type learning automata. Well known learning automata of P, Q and S types are special cases of F type automata. Among others we prove that these automata are nonabsorbing. A general routing scheme enabling implementation of different routing strategies including Best Quality Routing (BQR) and Least Cost Routing (LCR) has been defined and evaluated through simulation results obtained for connection oriented telecommunication network.

Despite of learning through simulation, student, especially in polytechnic, have to be more involved in the hands on practice. Z80 is one of the simplest microprocessor system for studied. Many of existing Z80 learning board came with tons of user friendly interfaces, such as a keypad and alphanumerical LCD, however, the most important basic of this subject, the data transfer signaling, is sometime difficult to show. In this paper, we present a Z80 microprocessor module as learning facility with a HMI chip that is designed using FPGA chip, which is allow us to gate and control the microprocessor signals. The HMI chip implanted several control functions; the STEP unit, DMA unit, control memory unit, I/O control unit, address and data control unit, and system reset unit. Units in the HMI chip works very structured, and interconnected. With the signal controlled from the HMI chip units, the microprocessor work process becomes more easily to be manipulated and observed. The process of storing and reading program using DMA also can be easier to understand. Simple layout of the main board greatly facilitate student in operate and analyze a running program. Since the HMI chip built on an LVCMOS technology, while the classic Z80 CPU is still a CMOS, two-way bus logic level converters from 3.3V to 5V have to be used. Working frequency achieved is from 3MHz to 10MHz.","","978-1-5090-1640-2","10.1109/ELECSYM.2016.7860998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860998","Z80 microprocessor Systems;DMA;Chip design;HMI;FPGA","Microprocessors;Field programmable gate arrays;Pins;Random access memory;Control systems;Arrays","educational courses;electrical engineering education;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;man-machine systems;microprocessor chips","two-way bus logic level converters;LVCMOS technology;running program;system reset unit;data control unit;I/O control unit;control memory unit;DMA unit;STEP unit;microprocessor signals;FPGA chip;HMI chip;learning facility;data transfer signaling;alphanumerical LCD;keypad;user friendly interfaces;Z80 learning board;electrical engineering;microprocessor system;Z80 microprocessor learning module;human-machine interface;FPGA technology;voltage 3.3 V to 5 V;frequency 3 MHz to 10 MHz","","2","","8","","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As opposed to point-sampled sound sources, our approach projects the area-volumetric source to the spherical domain centered at the listener and represents this projection area compactly using the spherical harmonic (SH) basis functions. By representing the head-related transfer function (HRTF) in the same basis, we demonstrate that spatial audio which corresponds to an area-volumetric source can be efficiently computed as a dot product of the SH coefficients of the projection area and the HRTF. This results in an efficient technique whose computational complexity and memory requirements are independent of the complexity of the sound source. Our approach can support dynamic area-volumetric sound sources at interactive rates. We evaluate the performance of our technique in large complex VR environments and demonstrate significant improvement over the naive point-sampling technique. We also present results of a user evaluation, conducted to quantify the subjective preference of the user for our approach over the point-sampling approach in VR environments.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2518134","Oculus & Facebook; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383327","Spatial audio;HRTF;area sources;volumetric sources;spherical harmonics;Spatial audio;HRTF;area sources;volumetric sources;spherical harmonics","Ear;Harmonic analysis;Rendering (computer graphics);Three-dimensional displays;Virtual environments;Transfer functions","audio signal processing;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","HRTF;spatial audio rendering technique;VR environments;point sampled sound sources;area-volumetric source;spherical harmonic;head related transfer function;spatial audio;computational complexity;memory requirements;sound source complexity;interactive rates;virtual reality","","34","1","38","","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At some point children will attempt to cross a road unsupervised, at that point in time their safety depends on the effectiveness of their road safety education. To date, various attempts to supplement road safety education with technology were made. Most common approach focus on addressing declarative knowledge, by delivering road safety theory in an engaging fashion. Apart from expanding on text based resources to include instructional videos and animations, some stakeholders (e.g.: Irish Road Safety Authority) attempt to take advantage of game-based learning [1]. However, despite the high capacity for interaction being common in Virtual Environments, available game-based solutions to road safety education are currently limited to delivering and assessing declarative knowledge. With recent advancements in the field of Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Displays, procedural knowledge might also be addressed in Virtual Environments. This paper describes the design and development process of a computer-supported learning system that attempts to address psycho-motor skills involved in crossing a road safely, changing learners' attitude towards road safety best practices, and enabling independent practice of transferable skills. By implementing game-based learning principles and following best practice for serious game design (such as making educational components essential to successful game-play, or instructional scaffolding) we hope to make it not only more effective, but also engaging, allowing us to rely on learners' intrinsic motivation [2], to increase their independent practice time and provide them with feedback that will help to condition safe behaviour and increase retention. Presence in Virtual Reality might evoke responses to Virtual Environment as if it was real (RAIR) [3] and enable learners to truly experience learning scenarios. In consequence leading to formation of autobiographical memories constructed from multisensory input, which should result in an increased knowledge retention and transfer [4].","","978-1-5386-6304-2","10.1109/GEM.2018.8516493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8516493","Virtual Reality;VR;Road Safety;Serious Game;Experiential Learning;Game-Based Learning;Virtual Environment","Games;Road safety;Virtual environments;Training","computer aided instruction;helmet mounted displays;road safety;serious games (computing);virtual reality","road safety education;declarative knowledge;road safety theory;road safety best practices;serious game design;virtual reality serious game;virtual environment;virtual reality head mounted displays;Woodlands;game-based learning","","4","","34","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Participants were asked to learn the location of a virtual object in a virtual environment (VE). After a short period of time they were asked to recall the location by placing a real version of the object in the real-world equivalent environment. Results indicate that the average placement error, or distance between original and recalled object location, is approximately 20cm for all locomotion technique conditions. This result is similar to the outcome of a previous study on spatial memory in VEs that used real walking. We report this unexpected finding and suggest further work on spatial memory in VR by recommending the replication of this study in different environments and using objects with a wider diversity of properties, including varying sizes and shapes.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-6647-6","10.1109/VR.2017.7892303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892303","H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems — Artificial, augmented, and Virtual Realities;I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism — Virtual Reality","Legged locomotion;Virtual environments;Navigation;Visualization;Standards","brain;human computer interaction;realistic images;virtual reality","object location memory error;virtual environment;real environment;spatial knowledge transfer;spatial memory;immersive virtual reality;locomotion technique;joystick;pointing-and-teleporting;walking-in-place;object location learning;object location recall;placement error","","3","","9","","6 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designing surgical simulators, however, poses the challenge of creating trainers that effectively instill not only high-level understanding of the steps to be taken in a given situation, but also the low-level “muscle-memory” needed to perform delicate surgical procedures. It is often impossible to build an ideal simulator that perfectly mimics the haptic experience of a surgical procedure, but by focussing on the aspects of the experience that are perceptually salient we can build simulators that effectively instill learning. We propose a general method for the design of surgical simulators that augment the perceptually salient aspects of an interaction. Using this method, we can increase skill-transfer rates without requiring expensive improvements in the capability of the rendering hardware or the computational complexity of the simulation. In this paper, we present our decomposition-based method for surgical simulator design, and describe a user-study comparing the training effectiveness of a haptic-search-task simulator designed using our method versus an unaugmented simulator. The results show that perception-based task decomposition can be used to improve the design of surgical simulators that effectively impart skill by targeting perceptually significant aspects of the interaction.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2011.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975145","Haptic I/O;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;life and medical sciences;surgical simulation.","Haptic interfaces;Surgery;Training;Needles;Rendering (computer graphics);Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","augmented reality;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;surgery","perceptually augmented simulator design;training simulator;air-traffic control;piloting;nuclear power station monitoring;surgical simulator;low-level muscle-memory;surgical procedure;haptic experience;salient interaction aspect;skill-transfer rate;rendering hardware;computational complexity;decomposition-based method;user study;haptic-search-task simulator;unaugmented simulator;perception-based task decomposition","","2","","21","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The availability of a camera and a large number of sensors in mobile devices will enable CV applications that understand the environment and enhance people's lives through augmented reality. One of the problems yet to solve is how to transfer demanding state-of-the-art CV algorithms -designed to run on powerful desktop computers with several GPUs- onto energy-efficient, but slow, processors and GPUs found in mobile devices. To accommodate to the lack of performance, current CV applications for mobile devices are simpler versions of more complex algorithms, which generally run slowly and unreliably and provide a poor user experience. In this paper, we investigate ways to speed up demanding CV applications to run faster on mobile devices. We selected KinectFusion (KF) as a representative CV application. The KF application constructs a 3D model from the images captured by a Kinect. After porting it to an ARM platform, we applied several optimisation and parallelisation techniques using OpenCL to exploit all the available computing resources. We evaluated the impact on performance and power and demonstrate a 4× speedup with just a 1.38× power increase. We also evaluated the performance portability of our optimisations by running on a different platform, and assessed similar improvements despite the different multi-core configuration and memory system. By measuring processor temperature, we found overheating to be the main limiting factor for running such high-performance codes on a mobile device not designed for full continuous utilisation.","","978-1-4673-7311-1","10.1109/SAMOS.2015.7363653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363653","","Graphics processing units;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Optimization;Computational modeling;Performance evaluation","augmented reality;cameras;computer vision;graphics processing units;image capture;mobile computing;mobile handsets;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation","high-performance codes;memory system;multicore configuration;computing resources;ARM platform;image capture;3D model;KF application;KinectFusion;CV algorithms;augmented reality;CV applications;mobile devices;sensors;computer vision applications;mobile computing platforms","","4","","17","","28 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The BTA must have a sufficiently large buffer, called a virtual channel queue (VCQ), to temporarily store multiple, partially received packets from different virtual channels. The buffer requirement of a shared-memory VCQ is studied for different packet loss probabilities and virtual channel numbers. Two different architectures for implementing the shared-memory VCQ are compared. The second architecture with multiple linked queues in the shared-memory requires less memory and has better scalability to accommodate a large number of virtual channels and is adopted in the analysis. Several possible error conditions, such as shared-memory overflow, the received packet exceeding its maximum length, and the corruption of the pointer in the logical queue, are discussed. Corresponding solutions are proposed in the VCQ designs.<>","","0-7803-0602-3","10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=263587","","Asynchronous transfer mode;SONET;Computer architecture;Local area networks;Costs;LAN interconnection;Computer networks;Buffer storage;Computer simulation;Scalability","asynchronous transfer mode;broadband networks;computer interfaces;LAN interconnection;queueing theory;SONET","ATM network;LAN interconnection;SONET;virtual channel queue;ATM broadband terminal adaptor;computer hosts;local area networks;asynchronous transfer mode;partially received packets;virtual channels;linked queues;shared-memory overflow","","4","8","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach allows for interactive streaming and rendering of millions of particles and it enables virtual exploration of high resolution fields in a way similar to real-world experiments. The ability to display the dynamics of large particle sets using visualization options like shaded points or oriented texture splats provides an effective means for visual flow analysis that is far beyond existing solutions. For each particle, flow quantities like vorticity magnitude and A2 are computed and displayed.

Visual feedback about self-movement was available for half the trials and was removed for the other half. Results indicated that a graphic representation of self-movement significantly decreased transfer time when objects were passed between subjects. Results also indicated decreased time to peak grip force and peak grip force rate by the receiver with this visual feedback. These results suggest that grip force production on objects acquired from another person benefit from a crude graphical representation of the finger pads. Furthermore, these results suggest that sources of sensory feedback cannot be studied in isolation. Instead we must consider how feedback modalities are integrated for successful interaction.

In the last years there have been many studies to allow cultural heritage to be preserved with great care, ensuring the memory for scholars but also for future generations. The methods for storing a cultural object are widely studied, but the best techniques to preserve different forms of heritage like temporary or intangible items, are still under discussion. In particular this article refers to the possibility of keeping track of the information contained in a temporary exhibition project, that by its nature exists for a limited amount of time before being finally destroyed or transferred. With the use of standard tools like photogrammetry and three-dimensional modeling we try to define a process in order to turn the temporary into permanent, both for archiving purposes or for allowing the public to access the temporary installation once the physical object has been dismounted.","","978-1-4673-2563-9","10.1109/VSMM.2012.6365902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365902","Temporary exhibition;temporary installation;Museum;Photogrammetry;3D Modeling","Cultural differences;Solid modeling;Image reconstruction;Lighting;Art;Rendering (computer graphics);Catalogs","exhibitions;history;information retrieval systems;museums;virtual reality","temporary exhibition project;fixed memories;museum institution;cultural heritage;digital reality;virtual reality;cultural object;photogrammetry;three-dimensional modeling;archiving purpose;physical object","","","","10","","3 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is implemented using two separate networks, one for the actor and one for the critic, but with similar structures. In addition to convolutional and fully connected layers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are included to address the limited observability present in the problem. As a proof of concept, we consider the case of robotic soccer using humanoid NAO V5 robots, which have reduced computational capabilities, and low-cost Red - Green - Blue (RGB) cameras as main sensors. The use of DRL allowed to obtain a complex and high performant policy from scratch, without any prior knowledge of the domain, or the dynamics involved.

The current study introduces a novel simulation approach termed memory-based motion simulation (MBMS), and presents its key element ""motion modification"" (MoM) algorithm. The proposed approach implements a computational model inspired by the generalized motor program (GMP) theory. Operationally, when a novel motion scenario is submitted to the MBMS system, its motion database is searched to find relevant existing motions. The selected motions, referred to as ""root motions"", most likely do not meet exactly the novel motion scenario, and therefore, they need to be modified by the MoM algorithm. This algorithm derives a parametric representation of possible variants of a root motion in a GMP-like manner, and adjusts the parameter values such that the new modified motion satisfies the novel motion scenario, while retaining the root motion's overall angular movement pattern and inter-joint coordination. An evaluation of the prediction capability of the algorithm, using both seated upper body reaching and whole-body load-transfer motions, indicated that the algorithm can accurately predict various human motions with errors comparable to the inherent variability in human motions when repeated under identical task conditions.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.822965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288349","","Humans;Biological system modeling;Ergonomics;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Testing;Design automation;Man machine systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Prototypes","human computer interaction;ergonomics;digital simulation;motion estimation;CAD","memory-based human motion simulation;motion modification algorithm;computer simulation;human motion planning;human machine interaction;generalized motor program theory;motion database;parametric representation;root motion;angular movement pattern;interjoint coordination;load transfer motions;human motions","","49","2","51","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the cloud gaming terminology, the users who have poor resources are referred to as “Thin Clients”. On the other hand, cloud service providers should be able to provide minimum frame rate required by a computer game, simultaneously, to several thin clients at the same time, in such a way that meets the users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Generally, computer games have different degrees of render settings by default, in terms of three levels: high, medium, and low. These setting levels, in turn, can be translated into hardware and operating system capabilities, such as maximum textual details, brightness, contrast, and so on. Cloud game service providers use rendering settings as a means for transferring the frames of the game to thin clients. They also try to maximize their own profits with pricing on game frames. This paper addresses the subject of resource optimization using a pricing mechanism. The designed mechanism is able to allocate game frames in such a way that leads to achieving high user QoE and also maximizing the profit of the cloud server. We set the price of the frames considering their types. Each type has its own processor, memory, GPU requirements, etc. Our goal is to find the optimal combination of types for each user. Our proposed method is able to dynamically adapt itself to the requirements of both sides of the network. We also consider the scheduling issues of the cloud server in order to transfer the frames to the requested users. When the number of users is very high, the proposed mechanism applies the settings in such a way that the QoE is maintained at the desired level and the user's satisfaction is not violated at all. Simulation results show that the proposed priced-based approach attains lower bandwidth consumption values compared to the case in which no pricing mechanism is used. Also, the social welfare of the users is maximized.","","978-1-7281-1114-8","10.1109/DGRC.2018.8712028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712028","Cloud Gaming;Frame Rate Allocation;Multi-rate;Knapsack Problem;Integer Linear Programming","Quality of experience;Games;Delays;Bandwidth;Servers;Resource management","cloud computing;computer games;optimisation;pricing;quality of experience;resource allocation","frame rate optimization;cloud services;hardware capabilities;cloud gaming terminology;cloud service providers;minimum frame rate;computer game;render settings;setting levels;operating system capabilities;cloud game service providers;game frames;resource optimization;pricing mechanism;high user QoE;cloud server;priced-based approach;cloud gaming networks","","1","","25","","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, the reasoning method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were introduced into the multi system, and a kind of multi emotion decision model based on the emotion reasoning was constructed. The hierarchical structure method was used to solve the complex decision problem of the humanoid robot in the intelligent home environment. Then, based on the emotion energy theory, a mood state regulation algorithm based on the combination of HMM-based spontaneous transfer and stimulus transfer was established. In addition, on this basis, the design and implementation of humanoid robot associative memory model was realized. Finally, the theory and algorithm were integrated into the interactive platform of human-computer expression, and the validity of the model was analysed and verified. The results showed that, on this robot platform, the process of human-computer interaction and cooperation which integrated emotion evaluation, emotional decision, associative memory and emotion regulation was realized. As a result, the computer emotion decision based on artificial intelligence can be well applied in many fields.","","978-1-5386-8031-5","10.1109/ICVRIS.2018.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531405","Humanoid robot;human-computer interaction;emotion","Humanoid robots;Artificial intelligence;Hidden Markov models;Psychology;Cognition;Associative memory","analytic hierarchy process;control engineering computing;data mining;emotion recognition;hidden Markov models;human computer interaction;humanoid robots;psychology","computer emotion decision;artificial intelligence;artificial emotion generating engine;emotional spontaneous transfer;stimulus transfer model;multiemotion decision model;emotion reasoning;complex decision problem;intelligent home environment;emotion energy theory;humanoid robot associative memory model;human-computer interaction;integrated emotion evaluation;emotional decision;emotion regulation;psychological experiment;childrens game task;analytic hierarchy process;hierarchical structure method;mood state regulation algorithm;HMM-based spontaneous transfer;human-computer expression","","1","","9","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards 'Phenomenaria' in the teaching of distributed systems concepts","F. O'Donnell; B. Tangney","Centre for Res. in I.T. & Educ., Trinity Coll., Dublin, Ireland; Centre for Res. in I.T. & Educ., Trinity Coll., Dublin, Ireland","Proceedings 3rd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Technologies","28 Jul 2003","2003","","","256","257","Any learning environment can be parsed into five facets. These five facets are information banks, symbol pads, construction kits, 'phenomenaria' and task managers. 'Phenomenaria' are areas for the specific purpose of presenting phenomena and making them accessible to scrutiny and manipulation. Taken together these five facets offer a perspective on the general structure and style of the learning environment. A collection of processes, which are distinct, spatially separated, and which communicate by exchanging messages constitutes a distributed system. A distributed algorithm defines the steps to be taken by each process within that system, including the transfer of messages. It must be able to deal with the failure of one or more of the processes involved in its computation and also the failure of one or more message transmissions. A major problem in teaching the latter material is the ability to capture the dynamic movement of data. Typically, when demonstrating data movement on a white board, part of the existing data configuration must be erased in order to show the new configuration. A phenomenarium offers a way forward for both lecturers and students in that it provides mechanisms not only to animate but to simulate dynamic movement in visual form. Moreover, it can be housed within an environment that permits 'anytime anywhere' learning, like the World Wide Web. Simply stated, a phenomenarium permits a student to interact with elements of a given algorithm in their own time. An argument in favor of the use of the latter in the teaching of distributed algorithms is presented.","","0-7695-1967-9","10.1109/ICALT.2003.1215071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215071","","Education;Educational institutions;Distributed algorithms;Environmental management;Feedback;Probes;Animation;Web sites;Displays","distributed memory systems;distributed algorithms;message passing;digital simulation;Internet;teaching;computer science education","learning environment;distributed systems concept teaching;Phenomenaria;distributed system;message transmission;dynamic data movement simulation;white board data movement;real time visual display;World Wide Web;distributed algorithm teaching","","1","","7","","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we present SMPI, a simulator for MPI applications that uses on-line simulation, i.e., the application is executed but part of the execution takes place within a simulation component. SMPI simulations account for network contention in a fast and scalable manner. SMPI also implements an original and validated piece-wise linear model for data transfer times between cluster nodes. Finally SMPI simulations of large-scale applications on large-scale platforms can be executed on a single node thanks to techniques to reduce the simulation's compute time and memory footprint. These contributions are validated via a large set of experiments in which SMPI is compared to popular MPI implementations with a view to assess its accuracy, scalability, and speed.","1530-2075","978-1-61284-372-8","10.1109/IPDPS.2011.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012878","","Computational modeling;Analytical models;Delay;Data models;Random access memory;Scalability;Kernel","application program interfaces;computer science education;message passing;parallel programming;teaching","single node on-line simulation;SMPI;parallel programming teaching;high-performance computing teaching;network contention;piece-wise linear model;simulated message passing interface","","25","","28","","8 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Is children's motor learning of a postural reaching task enhanced by practice in a virtual environment?","D. E. Levac; B. B.

Engineering, University of Niš, Serbia","2017 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR)","14 Aug 2017","2017","","","1","7","To support the use of virtual environments (VEs) in pediatric rehabilitation, greater understanding of the extent and mechanisms by which practice in a VE might facilitate motor learning as compared to practice in a physical environment (PE) is required. One proposed mechanism is via enhanced user engagement and/or motivation, which may directly influence the quality of motor memory consolidation. The objectives of this study were to a) compare children's motor learning of the same novel postural reaching task in a VE versus a PE; b) evaluate differences in engagement and motivation between the two practice environments; and c) explore the relationships between practice environment, engagement, motivation, and motor learning. Thirty-six typically developing children aged 7-13 years were randomized to acquire a novel postural reaching skill in either a 2D flat-screen VE or a PE. Skin conductance level (SCL) was measured on the non-task hand during practice. Following acquisition, children completed a language-modified User Engagement Scale (UES) and the Pediatric Motivation Inventory (PMOT). Participants returned 1-7 days later for retention (same environment) and transfer (opposite environment) tests. Children who practiced in the VE demonstrated greater retention, as evidenced by higher mean scores on the retention test (t[30] = -3.72, p = 0.001, partial eta squared 0.28). Children who practiced in the PE demonstrated greater transfer to the opposite environment as compared to those who practiced in the VE (t[30] = 2.05, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.238). There were no significant differences in UES total or subscale scores between the 2 groups. PMOT total motivation scores differed significantly between groups, favoring the VE (t[30]= 2.49, p = 0.018, partial eta squared = 0.154). There were no significant differences in SCL peak count or peaks per minute between groups. There was no relationship between engagement, motivation, and retention or transfer performance. Findings suggest that retention but not transfer of a new motor skill may be facilitated by practice in a VE. This may be due to unique task demands in each environment. Children were more motivated to succeed in the VE and were engaged in the task in both environments, suggesting that both constructs should be measured in subsequent studies and that VE aesthetics alone may not be a key `active ingredient' of children's engagement. Subsequent research will more objectively quantify neurophysiological correlates of engagement and motivation, explore additional tasks, include populations with neurological impairments and compare 3D vs 2D VE displays.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007489","Virtual reality;video game;motor learning;engagement;motivation;children","Games;Pediatrics;Virtual environments;Medical treatment;Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays","computer games;medical computing;neurophysiology;paediatrics;skin;virtual reality","children motor learning;postural reaching task;virtual environment;pediatric rehabilitation;motor learning;physical environment;user engagement;motor memory consolidation;practice environment;skin conductance level;nontask hand;language-modified user engagement scale;pediatric motivation inventory;PMOT;UES;SCL;retention test;neurophysiological correlates;motivation impairments;3D VE displays;2D VE displays","","","","18","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate the image features of the 360-degree videos and the contextual information of the viewpoint trajectories. Specifically, we design ladder convolution to adapt for the distorted image, and propose LadderNet to transfer the knowledge from the pre-trained model and retrieve the features from the distorted image. We then combine the image features and the contextual viewpoints as the inputs for long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the future viewpoints. Our approach is compared with several state-of-the-art viewpoint prediction algorithms over two 360-degree video datasets.

To support such multimedia learning objects, its multimedia data service system should have a capacity to serve the growing number of clients and new data. A streaming server transfers multimedia files to clients from a repository of files in real time. The server must guarantee concurrent and uninterrupted delivery of each video stream requested by clients. To provide efficient services, many stream servers adopt multi-processors, sufficient memory, and RAID or SAN in their systems. In this paper, we propose a Linux-based parallel media streaming server. This system uses a unique striping policy to distribute multimedia files into the parallel storage nodes. If a service request occurs, each storage node transmits striped files concurrently to the client. Its performance is better than the existing single media streaming service.","","0-7695-1509-6","10.1109/CIE.2002.1185884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185884","","Streaming media;Network servers;Content management;Education;Multimedia systems;Educational technology;Video sharing;Videoconference;Computer displays;User interfaces","virtual reality;computer aided instruction;parallel processing;client-server systems;multimedia servers;multimedia systems","parallel media stream server;virtual class delivery;redundant arrays of inexpensive disks;multimedia learning objects;multimedia data service system;multimedia files transfer;client server system;concurrent delivery;uninterrupted delivery;video stream delivery;Linux-based parallel media streaming server;striping policy;multimedia files distribution;parallel storage nodes;service request","","1","","4","","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

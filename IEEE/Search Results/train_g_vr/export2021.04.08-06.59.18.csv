"Virtual reality as a complex interactive system: a multidimensional model of person artificial partner co-relations","A. Libin","Dept. of Psychol., Georgetown Univ., Rockville, MD, USA","Proceedings Seventh International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia","6 Aug 2002","2001","","","652","657","The operational definition of virtual reality as a complex interactive system (CIS) represents it as a configuration of exchanges between a person and a digital world mediated by the artificial, partner. The adequate model for understanding the essence of CIS includes, in addition to three 'traditional' dimensions (physical-per-se, mental, and virtual), a fourth dimension defined as individual self-determination and formed by one's needs, preferences, profile of imagination, identities, and individual experiences. The analysis of 'person-artificial agent' interactions in the context of a complex systems approach is associated with the implementation of such interaction effects as compensation, optimization, adequacy, and effectiveness. Virtual entertainment can be viewed not only as a part of modern popular culture but also as a tool for constructive activities. The latter, employed by certain groups of users, can not only enhance their life as an enjoyment but also as training tool for sensory-motor, cognitive and emotional improvement, and their well-being in general.","","0-7695-1402-2","10.1109/VSMM.2001.969724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969724","","Virtual reality;Interactive systems;Multidimensional systems;Computational Intelligence Society;Humans;Visual perception;Cultural differences;Search engines;Psychology;Aging","virtual reality;man-machine systems;software agents;computer games;interactive systems","complex interactive system;virtual reality;artificial agent;individual preferences;man machine interactions;computer game","","4","","30","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current VR software packages do not yet offer an idea solution to the problem of creating realistic virtual prototypes. This problem is especially true for large industrial products such as in the aerospace industry. These large products would especially benefit from virtual prototyping in areas such as maintenance, assembly and training. It is important to minimise the preparation and evaluation time in these short production runs and individually specified products. Three areas are examined: data reduction, economic conversion costs and real time implementation methods are discussed. These include task based reduction and more general compression methods. The use of human factors with intelligent responsive manikins is outlined along with a range of desirable features. Real environments require complex interactions and open systems with user specified code and debugging. The state of some VR systems are described and it is shown how research in these areas can overcome the current limitations of industrial virtual reality packages. The work is based on experience with large models, multiple VR packages and manikin interactions.","","","10.1049/ic:19980753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=744430","","","virtual reality","human interactions;complex product development;virtual reality;virtual prototypes;electrical properties;mechanical properties;aesthetic properties;ergonomic properties;design stage;software packages;virtual prototyping;maintenance;assembly;training;data reduction;economic conversion costs;real time implementation methods;task based reduction;compression methods;human factors;intelligent responsive manikins;open systems;complex interactions;user specified code;debugging;industrial virtual reality packages;large models","","2","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To address this problem, the American Research Corporation of Virginia (ARCOVA) is developing the Interactive Multimedia Program for Alcoholism Assessment and Counseling Training (IMPACT), a combination of audiovisual media and programmed interaction for the teaching of alcoholism management skills to physicians and nurses at both the student and professional levels. The hallmark of this program is a role-play activity with patient personalities simulated by digital audio and video that will respond to questions posed by the user.","","0-8186-7105-X","10.1109/MMCS.1995.484942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=484942","","Alcoholism;Employee welfare;Management training;Alcoholic beverages;Medical diagnostic imaging;Hospitals;Psychology;Education;Educational institutions;Mental disorders","multimedia computing;interactive systems;computer based training;medical administrative data processing;audio-visual systems;teaching","IMPACT;Interactive Multimedia Program for Alcoholism Assessment and Counseling Training;digital audio;DSM-III-R criteria;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;lifetime alcohol abuse;lifetime alcohol dependence;alcoholic diagnosis;excessive drinking;medical practice;digital video;stereotyping;audiovisual media;programmed interaction;teaching;alcoholism management skills;physicians;nurses;student level;professional level;role-play activity;simulated patient personalities","","","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As users of the health care system, we rely on our ability to manage information to combat illness and stay healthy. When seeking help for a health-related problem or question, we navigate a complex system where health services are distributed across multiple clinicians in a variety of specializations and institutions. Within the system, efforts to reduce costs have limited the time clinicians are able to spend with patients. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest of psychopathology for therapeutic uses of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Researchers and clinicians are carrying out interdisciplinary projects and empirical investigations of computer-based treatments dedicated to the rehabilitation of psychiatric patients. Some projects gave rise to practical implementations in clinical settings, a quite publicized example being the use of virtual reality for treating various forms of phobias and anxiety disorders. Companies specialized in developing software intended for psychotherapy are starting to emerge. Effective management of information is particularly challenging for patients facing conditions (such as cancer) requiring extended outpatient care. For cancer patients, a primary intervention (such as surgery) is generally followed by therapy (such as radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy) that can last additional weeks, months, or years. As a result, they must stay on top of changing treatment regimens while trying to maintain their routine at work and at home.","2153-0742","978-1-4577-0903-6","10.1109/CCST.2011.6095892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095892","personal information management;health","Security;Training;Computers;Electronic mail;Computational modeling;Medical treatment","computer based training;health care;information management;medical disorders;patient treatment;virtual reality","computer-based cognitive;socio-emotional training;personal health information management;health care system;health services;psychopathology;information and communication technologies;computer-based treatments;psychiatric patient rehabilitation;virtual reality;phobia treatment;anxiety disorders","","1","","11","","8 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its focus lies on the visualization of a probabilistic robot localization algorithm considering noise in the sensors and actuators of the robot on the one hand, as well as an environment filled with obstacles which damage the robot on contact on the other hand. The goal of the simulation is training students on the intricacies of the algorithm and to develop a notion on the impact of the considered factors such as the degree of sustained sensory noise. In order to facilitate learning and promote exploration, we embed a game mode that conveys the basic interactions with the simulator and the factors shaping the robot's behavior. In the game, the player helps the simulated robot to reach its destination with as little damage as possible. This is done by setting waypoints for the robot by adjusting the parameters of the deployed localization algorithm as well as the quality of sensors and the accuracy of the robots movements. By playing with these parameters, the user playfully learns their effects, which are visualized in 3D - contrary to the hard mathematical approach presented in books. SkyNetz also has the capacity to communicate with a real robot, to show its current position and position estimates. In the long run, this will provide the foundation for novel augmented reality games. The paper includes a general introduction to the topic of interactive robot simulation, background on the specific problem of localization estimation, the presentation of our approach and the results from a small user study.","","978-1-5090-2722-4","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2016.7590365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590365","","Robot sensing systems;Collision avoidance;Kalman filters;Games;Probabilistic logic","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;data visualisation;digital simulation;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;probability","Skynetz;playful experiential robotics simulator;playful interactive robotics simulator;computer science students;probabilistic robot localization algorithm;actuators;training students;sensory noise;game mode;robot behavior;3D visualization;augmented reality games;localization estimation problem","","","","9","","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Very often, individual simulators are very unique and so it is often difficult to classify military simulations even for experienced users. This circumstance is further boosted due to the fact that in the field of military simulations - unlike in other areas - no general classification for military simulations exists. To address this shortcoming, this publication is dedicated to the idea of providing a first contribution to the development of a commonly accepted taxonomy in the area of military simulations. To this end, the problem field is structured into three main categories (general functional requirements for simulators, special military requirements for simulators and non-functional requirements for simulators). Based upon that, individual categories are provided with appropriate classes. For a better understanding, the taxonomy is also applied to a concrete example (NetLogo Rebellion).","","978-1-4673-7008-0","10.1109/MilCIS.2015.7348943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7348943","Simulation;Military;Classification;Taxonomy","Games;Taxonomy;Military aircraft;Training;Surfaces;Game theory;History","computer based training;digital simulation;military computing","military simulation evaluation;assessment criteria taxonomy;large DoD development program;special military requirements;general functional requirements;simulators;nonfunctional requirements;close combat tactical trainer;joint tactical combat training system;battle force tactical training;warfighter simulation 2000","","1","","42","","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Real-time in-situ visual feedback of task performance in mixed environments for learning joint psychomotor-cognitive tasks","A. Kotranza; D. Scott Lind; C. M. Pugh; B. Lok","College of Engineering, University of Florida, USA; Dept. of Surgery Medical College of Georgia, USA; Feinberg School of Medicine , Northwestern University, USA; College of Engineering, University of Florida, USA","2009 8th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","17 Nov 2009","2009","","","125","134","This paper proposes an approach to mixed environment training of manual tasks requiring concurrent use of psychomotor and cognitive skills. To train concurrent use of both skill sets, the learner is provided real-time generated, in-situ presented visual feedback of her performance. This feedback provides reinforcement and correction of psychomotor skills concurrently with guidance in developing cognitive models of the task. The general approach is presented: 1) Sensors placed in the physical environment detect in real-time a learner's manipulation of physical objects. 2) Sensor data is input to models of task performance which output quantitative measures of the learner's performance. 3) Pre-defined rules are applied to transform the learner's performance data into visual feedback presented in realtime and in-situ with the physical objects being manipulated. With guidance from medical education experts, we have applied this approach to a mixed environment for learning clinical breast exams (CBEs). CBE belongs to a class of tasks that require learning multiple cognitive elements and task-specific psychomotor skills. Traditional approaches to learning CBEs and other joint psychomotor-cognitive tasks rely on extensive one-onone training with an expert providing subjective feedback. By integrating real-time visual feedback of learners' quantitatively measured CBE performance, a mixed environment for learning CBEs provides on-demand learning opportunities with more objective, detailed feedback than available with expert observation. The proposed approach applied to learning CBEs was informally evaluated by four expert medical educators and six novice medical students. This evaluation highlights that receiving real-time in-situ visual feedback of their performance provides students an advantage, over traditional approaches to learning CBEs, in developing correct psychomotor and cognitive skills.","","978-1-4244-5390-0","10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336485","mixed reality;information visualization","Psychology;Breast;Educational institutions;Assembly;Visualization;Education;Object detection;Output feedback;Virtual reality;Computer applications","augmented reality;biomedical education;computer based training;feedback;medical computing;patient diagnosis","real-time in-situ visual feedback;task performance;learning;mixed environment training;psychomotor skills;cognitive skills;skills reinforcement;skills correction;learner manipulation;physical objects;output quantitative measure;medical education;clinical breast exam;detailed feedback;medical students","","22","","30","","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we present a method for animating the small intestine and the mesentery (the tissue that connects it to the main vessels) in real-time, thus enabling user interaction through virtual surgical tools during the simulation. We present a stochastic approach for fast collision detection in highly deformable, self-colliding objects. A simple and efficient response to collisions is also introduced in order to reduce the overall animation complexity. Second, we describe a new method based on generalized cylinders for fast rendering of the intestine. An efficient curvature detection method, along with an adaptive sampling algorithm, is presented. This approach, while providing improved tessellation without the classical self-intersection problem, also allows for high-performance rendering thanks to the new 3D skinning feature available in recent GPUs. The rendering algorithm is also designed to ensure a guaranteed frame rate.

The job-rotation e-service is an integrated on-line system that links training policy with employment policy. On one hand it supports enterprises to find the proper training for their employees and on the other it supports them to find adequate unemployed resources to replace their own while on training. All involved parties benefit from this rotation. The main problem of the job rotation e-service, and generally of systems providing information on vocational training, is the lack of up to date information on running courses due to large administrative costs.

Then, how user experience is affected by different factors, including users' viewing angle, tiling (how the 360 VR video is partitioned into smaller parts to facilitate transmission), stall and resolution switch, is analyzed mathematically.

Objectives: Develop an AI-based interview simulator for helping novice requirements engineers in gaining interview skills. Methods: The research is based on the Design Science Methodology for Information Systems. The simulator is the outcome of six cycles; in each cycle, a proof of concept with additional features is created. Each cycle finishes with evaluation and improvement suggestions. Results: The simulator has been tested with students and results have been promising. The interview simulator understands context-free questions, retrieving the right information related to RE concepts such as goals, tasks, users, benefits, and constraints. The simulator also answers questions based on the context, makes summaries of the conversation, responds to meta-questions, and adds ambiguity and incompleteness to the conversation. Conclusions: The results have been promising. The simulator has been tested with degree and master level students. They were able to create a requirements specification using the simulator, and the feedback has been generally positive. The simulator will be tested in a real RE course in the academic year 2020-2021.

In this study, an innovative VR-based pinch skill training and strengthening system using haptics simulation was developed for the long-term recovery of upper extremity motor function post stroke. Two subject tests were conducted. The first was a healthy subject test conducted with 30 participants to verify the system design and functionality, specifically emphasizing difficulty levels and behavior phases. The second was a pilot test conducted on two stroke patients to examine the feasibility and therapeutic effects of the proposed system. Upon completion of the pilot test, the results of clinical assessment showed that both participants were improved. Using synchronized kinematic and kinetic data, the participants' behavior time-history was reconstructed for behavior interpretation and motor activity analysis. Finally, user acceptance of the technology was high, indicating that the participants intended to continue using the proposed system for rehabilitation.","","978-1-5386-1431-0","10.1109/INCIT.2017.8257885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257885","haptics;pinch;stroke;upper extremity;virtual reality (VR) therapy;rehabilitation","Force;Thumb;Haptic interfaces;Training;Information technology","biomechanics;haptic interfaces;medical computing;medical disorders;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","innovative VR-based pinch skill training;haptics simulation;stroke patients;virtual reality;stroke rehabilitation;haptic feedback;pinch simulation;motor activity analysis","","1","","18","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designing surgical simulators, however, poses the challenge of creating trainers that effectively instill not only high-level understanding of the steps to be taken in a given situation, but also the low-level “muscle-memory” needed to perform delicate surgical procedures. It is often impossible to build an ideal simulator that perfectly mimics the haptic experience of a surgical procedure, but by focussing on the aspects of the experience that are perceptually salient we can build simulators that effectively instill learning. We propose a general method for the design of surgical simulators that augment the perceptually salient aspects of an interaction. Using this method, we can increase skill-transfer rates without requiring expensive improvements in the capability of the rendering hardware or the computational complexity of the simulation. In this paper, we present our decomposition-based method for surgical simulator design, and describe a user-study comparing the training effectiveness of a haptic-search-task simulator designed using our method versus an unaugmented simulator. The results show that perception-based task decomposition can be used to improve the design of surgical simulators that effectively impart skill by targeting perceptually significant aspects of the interaction.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2011.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975145","Haptic I/O;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;life and medical sciences;surgical simulation.","Haptic interfaces;Surgery;Training;Needles;Rendering (computer graphics);Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","augmented reality;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;surgery","perceptually augmented simulator design;training simulator;air-traffic control;piloting;nuclear power station monitoring;surgical simulator;low-level muscle-memory;surgical procedure;haptic experience;salient interaction aspect;skill-transfer rate;rendering hardware;computational complexity;decomposition-based method;user study;haptic-search-task simulator;unaugmented simulator;perception-based task decomposition","","2","","21","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We often have to rebuild many object models for a new simulation setup, which is very tedious and time consuming. To reduce the cost and time in building up different simulation environments, it is therefore highly desirable to have a repository of object models that are interoperable and extensible thus can be reused in different applications. To this end, we propose a generic model framework which supports model interoperability and reusability for MOUT simulations.

In this paper, we propose a solution designed for hi-fi prototyping of gestures within a virtual reality environment through a high-level Domain-Specific Language (DSL), as a subset of the natural language. The proposed DSL allows non-programmer users to intuitively describe a broad domain of poses and connect them for compound gestures. Our DSL was designed to be general enough for multiple input classes, such as body tracking, hand tracking, head movement, motion controllers, and buttons. We tested our solution for wands with VR designers and developers. Results showed that the tool gives non-programmers the ability to prototype gestures with ease and refine its recognition within a few minutes.","","978-1-7281-7675-8","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct51615.2020.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288432","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques;Treemaps; Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization design and evaluation methods","Training;Solid modeling;Tracking;Natural languages;Tools;DSL;Task analysis","gesture recognition;high level languages;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);motion control;object tracking;software prototyping;virtual reality","gestural interfaces;design space;user interaction;spatial metaphors;immersive experiences;machine learning;virtual reality environment;high-level domain-specific language;DSL;natural language;nonprogrammer users;compound gestures;prototype gestures;fast hi-fi prototyping;natural experience;gesture recognition;gestural interaction rapid prototyping;body tracking;hand tracking;head movement;motion controllers;buttons;Ginput","","","","7","","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two reasons for the inability are trainees can only observe an operation before he participates in a surgery and preoperative rehearsal usually involves 2D (two dimensional) paper surgical simulations based on X-ray images. Moreover, surgery visiting doctors may also fail in real operations even after evaluating topology and geometry changes on rigid bones, prostheses and bone grafts of all procedures by 2D paper simulations. The failure rates were reported as 10-20% for setting-bone surgery. Computer-based surgery simulation represents a rapidly emerging and increasingly important area of research that combines a number of disciplines for the common purpose of improving health care. Generally, the goal of computer-based surgery simulation is to enable a surgeon to experiment with different surgical procedures in an artificial environment. We are developing a virtual surgical simulator specifically for HIT-RAOS, the robot-assisted setting-bone surgery system, which involves both various robots modeling and patients modeling. To satisfy requires on surgery programming and surgery rehearse based on special patient, a novel method of biological tissue model and simulation based special CT images includes 10 series is proposed in this article. Biological tissue geometry model, physical model and mechanical equilibrium equation based on strain energy function are built. Biomechanical equations are solved by finite element method.

The new motion-sensing technology, Kinect, is cost effective and does not require the patient to wear sensors on the body, which increases freedom of movement. The objective of this study was to use Kinect technology to develop a VR stroke rehabilitation system with unilateral and bilateral tasks for recovering the function of the upper extremity. This study tested the feasibility, therapeutic effectiveness, and user acceptance of this technology. Two participants with various levels of motor severity received 30-minute stroke rehabilitation 3 times per week over 8 weeks (a total 24 training sessions). The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Test Évaluant la performance des Membres supérieurs des Personnes Âgées (TEMPA), and Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance (FMA) were used to collect data before and after rehabilitation, and during a follow-up to detect the changes of functional performance. Questionnaires of user acceptance of the technology were administered. On completion of the rehabilitation program, using the proposed Kinect-based VR training system, WMFT, TEMPA, and FMA results increased for both participants. The technology acceptance questionnaires indicated that participants had strong intentions to continue using the proposed system for rehabilitation. We developed the first Kinect-based stroke rehabilitation for the upper extremity, and demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness in improving upper extremity function after a stroke. A large-scale study should be conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed system for stroke rehabilitation.","","978-1-7281-2820-7","10.1109/Ubi-Media.2019.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049601","Stroke, upper extremity, effectiveness, virtual-reality therapy","Task analysis;Stroke (medical condition);Extremities;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Medical treatment;Atmospheric measurements","image motion analysis;medical disorders;medical image processing;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","physical performance;rehabilitation program;Kinect-based VR training system;Kinect-based stroke rehabilitation;upper extremity function;Kinect-based system;virtual reality-based stroke rehabilitation;stroke patients;motion-sensing technology;Kinect technology;VR stroke rehabilitation system;bilateral tasks;motor severity;stroke rehabilitation;Wolf Motor Function Test;Test Evaluant la performance des Membres superieurs des Personnes Agees;time 8.0 week","","","","16","","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, many of the results found in the haptic feedback literature cannot be replicated independently. With experimental results, the paper demonstrates that ""off the shelf,"" general purpose robotics equipment can be incorporated into an effective haptic/kinesthetic feedback system. Such a system can accommodate a wide variety of virtual reality applications including training and telerobotics.

To take it into consideration and minimize its occurrence, evaluation methods are required. The current methods are mainly based on subjective measurements and therefore have several drawbacks (e.g., non-continuous, intrusive). Physiological signals combined with Machine Learning (ML) methods seem an interesting approach to go beyond these limits. In this paper, we present a large-scale experimentation (103 participants) where physiological data (cardiac and electrodermal activities) and subjective data (perceived VR sickness) were gathered during 30-minute VR video game sessions. Using ML methods, models were trained to predict VR sickness level (based on the physiological data labeled with the subjective data). Results showed an explained variance up to 75% (in a regression approach) and an accuracy up to 91% (in a classification approach).

An important role here plays computing resources which allow to minimize computational time and to increase the complexity of the simulation models. Parallel computing systems open for scientists a new level of simulation, but they also set high requirements on specific knowledge and experience of the users. As a result, granting access to computing resources is not sufficient, specialised training of the personnel is also needed.

Experimental results with good visual effects demonstrate that the proposed method can be generally applied in both outdoor and indoor scenes.

These objects are not necessarily directly related to the task at hand, and the movement of an object might even be entirely unintentional. If another person is touching the object at the same time, the movement can transfer through the object and be experienced - however subtly - by the other person. For example, when one person hands a drink to another, at some point both individuals will be touching the glass, and consequently exerting small (often unnoticed) forces on the other person. Despite the frequency of such subtle incidental movements of shared objects in everyday interactions, few have examined how these movements affect human-virtual human (VH) interaction. We ran an experiment to assess how presence and social presence are affected when a person experiences subtle, incidental movement through a shared real-virtual object. We constructed a real-virtual room with a table that spanned the boundary between the real and virtual environments. The participant was seated on the real side of the table, which visually extended into the virtual world via a projection screen, and the VH was seated on the virtual side of the table. The two interacted by playing a game of “Twenty Questions,” where one player asked the other a series of 20 yes/no questions to deduce what object the other player was thinking about. During the game, the “wobbly” group of subjects experienced subtle incidental movements of the real-virtual table: the entire real-virtual table tilted slightly away/toward the subject when the virtual/real human leaned on it. The control group also played the same game, except the table did not wobble. Results indicate that the wobbly group had higher presence and social presence with the virtual human in general, with statistically significant increases in presence, co-presence, and attentional allocation. We present the experiment and results, and discuss some potential implications for virtual human systems and some potential future studies.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-0836-0","10.1109/VR.2016.7504683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7504683","H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems — Artificial, Augmented and Virtual Realities;J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences — Psychology","Electronic mail;Measurement by laser beam;Virtual environments;Games;Training;Haptic interfaces;Force","human computer interaction;virtual reality","wobbly table;social presence;real-virtual table;subtle incidental movement;object movement;human-virtual human interaction;human-VH interaction;shared real-virtual object;real-virtual room;projection screen;virtual world;Twenty Questions game","","17","","42","","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, the development of these applications does not include a testing phase, or, at best, the evaluation is conducted only with the users. The activity of software testing has received considerable attention from researchers and software engineers who recognize its usefulness in creating quality products. However, the tests are expensive and prone to errors, which imposes the need to systematize and hence the definition of techniques to increase quality and productivity in their driving. Several testing techniques have been developed and have been used, each with its own characteristics in terms of effectiveness, cost, implementation stages, etc. Moreover, these techniques can also be adapted. In this paper, testing criteria based on scene graph are studied in order to ensure the quality of the Virtual Reality applications implementation.

While early approaches have used three-dimensional rendering on standard two-dimensional displays, recently researchers have started to use head-mounted displays to visualize software cities in immersive virtual reality systems (IVRS). For IVRS of a higher order it is claimed that they offer a higher degree of engagement and immersion as well as more intuitive interaction. On the other hand, spatial orientation may be a challenge in IVRS as already reported by studies on the use of IVRS in domains outside of software engineering such as gaming, education, training, and mechanical engineering or maintenance tasks. This might be even more true for the city metaphor for visualizing software. Software is immaterial and, hence, has no natural appearance. Only a limited number of abstract aspects of software are mapped onto visual representations so that software cities generally lack the details of the real world, such as the rich variety of objects or fine textures, which are often used as clues for orientation in the real world. In this paper, we report on an experiment in which we compare navigation in a particular kind of software city (EvoStreets) in two variants of IVRS.

Object manipulation and symbolic manipulation techniques based strictly on first person perspective are also generally less efficient than their desktop counterparts. Instead of considering the two environments as distinct, we have focused on the idea that desktop applications will likely need to transition smoothly into full immersion through intermediate states. The Withindows framework uses image-plane selection and through- the-lens techniques in an attempt to smooth the movement of both traditional and immersive applications across transitional states such as desktop stereo and multi-display setups. We propose using a virtual cursor in the dominant eye and a reinforcing cursor in the non-dominant eye to avoid ambiguity problems that have discouraged the use of image-plane selection in stereo. We show how image-plane selection resolves non-linear control-display relationships inherent in some approaches to desktop stereo. When combined with through-the-lens techniques, image-plane selection allows immersive viewpoint management and 2&‌#xBD;D object manipulation techniques analogous to those on the desktop. This approach resolves global search and scaling problems inherent in prior through-the-lens implementations. We describe extensions for 6 DOF input devices that do not supersede the default interaction method.

Numerous factors, however, make instilling teamwork skills into deep-space astronauts extremely challenging. First, due to communication difficulties and mission duration, teams must be trained in a wide variety of domains - from maintenance procedures throughout the ship, to extremely thorough medical training, to science evaluations. Second, there may be a significant delay between when such knowledge is acquired and when it is needed; for instance, several years may pass between an astronaut learning how to diagnose, and to treat, a collapsed lung. Third, training must anticipate a huge range of conditions; the sheer length of deep-space missions when compared to shuttle missions vastly increases the number, and scope, of possible situations that could arise, making it virtually impossible to train for every scenario. To face the myriad challenges of deep-space flight, inflight training must be readily available. Our solution is a low-fidelity simulation using game-based training that leverages our experience with intelligent tutoring system (ITS) technology. Game-based training is engaging - it provides an entertaining break from the more onerous aspects of deep-space flight. Moreover, it incentivizes practice of amorphous, but critical, teamwork skills, motivating crews to practice more frequently for either mission-related team training or generalizable team skills training. Finally, a game-based solution addresses the problem of finding the physical space in which to train when a small crew is constrained in a cramped environment for extended periods of time. This paper reviews the process of creating games based on firefighting on the International Space Station (ISS) and Medical Training. We review the process of analyzing the firefighting procedure to determine the teamwork skills involved; how those skills were mapped to game mechanics; what changes were made to try to make the experience more engaging; and finally, whether these changes were effective.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500503","","Training;Games;Measurement;Teamwork;Fires;Space missions;Engines","aerospace computing;aerospace simulation;biomedical education;computer based training;intelligent tutoring systems;medical computing;serious games (computing)","serious games;knowledge retention;long-duration space missions;NASA Johnson Space Center;deep-space astronauts;maintenance procedures;ship;medical training;science evaluations;astronaut learning;deep-space missions;sheer length;low-fidelity simulation;game-based training;intelligent tutoring system;ITS technology;deep-space flight;mission-related team training;generalizable team skills training;International Space Station;ISS;firefighting procedure;teamwork skills","","3","","9","","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such devices consist of engine section mockups for use with a real borescope. Our approach instead simulates engine sections in virtual reality, replacing the need for physical mockups. We model the engine casing as a ""black box"" where a simulated borescope tip is inserted (in practice a real borescope is used to provide tactile veridicality of the probe's braided sheath but the camera at its tip is not used). The probe's translational movement is mapped to the virtual camera's. The graphical engine representation can conceivably generalize to any engine section that can be modeled graphically. Since the interior chamber of the ""black box"" casing is empty, the critical component of our simulator is correct borescope tip navigation as well as force feedback response based on a mathematical model of collision detection of the tip in the computer generated environment. Haptic response is thought to be a key component of the simulator as it provides non-visual tactile awareness of the borescope tip within the engine under inspection and, more importantly, its contact with engine surfaces. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we design a novel motor-powered clamp that provides collision response to collision of the camera detected in virtual space. Second, we attempt to isolate the effect of the system's tactile response and provide empirical evaluation of its utility. In line with previous results, our empirical analysis reveals a trend toward a benefit in performance (speed), but suggests that the provision of haptic feedback, while preferred over a solely visual interface, may be perceived as extraneous in a visually-dominated discrimination task.","","978-1-4244-2047-6","10.1109/3DUI.2008.4476586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476586","I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniques¿Ergonomics;J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences¿Psychology","Haptic interfaces;Engines;Inspection;Cameras;Computational modeling;Aircraft propulsion;Turbines;Educational institutions;Virtual reality;Computer simulation","aerospace engineering;computer based training;engines;force feedback;graphical user interfaces;haptic interfaces;mechanical engineering computing;virtual reality","haptic virtual borescope;visual engine inspection training;aircraft engine inspection training;virtual reality;graphical engine representation;black box casing;borescope tip navigation;force feedback response;collision detection;computer generated environment","","1","1","19","","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, soft tissues often have elaborate nonlinear material characteristics. Most prominently, soft tissues are soft and compliant to small strains, but after initial deformations they are very resistant to further deformations even under large forces. Such material characteristic is referred as the nonlinear material incompliant which is computationally expensive and numerically difficult to simulate. This paper presents a constraint-based finite-element algorithm to simulate the nonlinear incompliant tissue materials efficiently for interactive simulation applications such as virtual surgery. Firstly, the proposed algorithm models the material stiffness behavior of soft tissues with a set of 3-D strain limit constraints on deformation strain tensors. By enforcing a large number of geometric constraints to achieve the material stiffness, the algorithm reduces the task of solving stiff equations of motion with a general numerical solver to iteratively resolving a set of constraints with a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel iterative process. Secondly, as a Gauss-Seidel method processes constraints individually, in order to speed up the global convergence of the large constrained system, a multiresolution hierarchy structure is also used to accelerate the computation significantly, making interactive simulations possible at a high level of details. Finally, this paper also presents a simple-to-build data acquisition system to validate simulation results with ex vivo tissue measurements. An interactive virtual reality-based simulation system is also demonstrated.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2326009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820761","Nonlinear soft tissue simulation and modeling;robotic-assisted surgery;virtual surgical training","Strain;Biological tissues;Materials;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Biological system modeling;Force","biomechanics;biomedical education;deformation;surgery;virtual reality","constraint-based soft tissue simulation;virtual surgical training;linear elastic model;soft tissue material properties;computational efficiency;nonlinear material characteristics;small strains;deformations;nonlinear material incompliant;interactive simulation;deformation strain tensors;strain limit constraints;geometric constraints;Gauss-Seidel iterative","Abdomen;Algorithms;Animals;Computer Simulation;Liver;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Reproducibility of Results;Robotic Surgical Procedures;Swine;User-Computer Interface","16","","25","","23 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Possible applications for DVE systems are multiplayer video games, military and industrial trainings, and collaborative engineering. In general, a DVE system is composed of many servers and each server is responsible to manage multiple clients who want to participate in the virtual world. Each server receives updates from different clients (such as the current position and orientation of each client) and then delivers this information to other clients in the virtual world. The server also needs to perform other tasks, such as object collision detection and synchronization control. A large scale DVE system needs to support many clients and this imposes a heavy requirement on networking resources and computational resources. Therefore, how to meet the growing requirement of bandwidth and computational resources is one of the major challenges in designing a scalable and cost-effective DVE system. In this paper, we propose an efficient partitioning algorithm that addresses the scalability issue of designing a large scale DVE system. The main idea is to dynamically divide the virtual world into different partitions and then efficiently assign these partitions to different servers. This way, each server will process approximately the same amount of workload. Another objective of the partitioning algorithm is to reduce the server-to-server communication overhead. The theoretical foundation of our dynamic partitioning algorithm is based on the linear optimization principle. We also illustrate how one can parallelize the proposed partitioning algorithm so that it can efficiently partition a very large scale DVE system. Lastly, experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning algorithm under various settings of the virtual world.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.993202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993202","","Partitioning algorithms;Network servers;Large-scale systems;Virtual environment;Wide area networks;Games;Industrial training;Collaboration;Object detection;Computer networks","client-server systems;groupware;virtual reality;resource allocation;linear programming","distributed virtual environment systems;efficient partitioning algorithm;wide area network;multiplayer video games;industrial trainings;military trainings;collaborative engineering;synchronization control;networking resources;computational resources;bandwidth;server-to-server communication overhead;dynamic partitioning algorithm;scalability;load balancing;linear optimization","","127","16","36","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main focus has been on models that are developed from the constructivist tradition, based on the notion that learners actively construct their own understanding and knowledge from their experiences. The topic of this paper is the possible future use of computer games technologies and games based narrative to support e-learning and as a tool for lifelong learning. Computer games metaphors and underpinning models are inherently constructivist, the gaming format is also chosen for its ability to engage. The gaming format also lends itself to support the known advantages of narrative from oral traditions and fits with the younger generation's interest in current trends in the entertainment industry. The decision to adopt a game-based approach to the development of e-learning follows on from a survey of current state-of-the art support for lifelong learning that was carried out by the authors, a key element of that investigation being the different techniques to improve learning and retention through engagement of the student. The increased availability of high bandwidth connections to support multi-user, graphics-rich environments such as gaming environments supports the use of these gaming technologies for virtual learning environments. The use of storytelling in education provides us with a mechanism to establish a relationship between games and virtual learning environments, there have been numerous trials of the use of on-line games setups suitable for this purpose in the form of simulations, MUDs and adventure games. During the last few years multiple virtual worlds have been developed for general communication between users from different parts of the world, and these can be used to support all the important social aspects of learning. From the perspective of our research we are interested in designing a model for an online games-based leaning environment using narrative models, witch will then be developed as an exemplar of this particular approach","","1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141656","computer games e-learning;simulation;virtual environment","Virtual environment;Electronic learning;Games;Educational institutions;Computer science education;Art;Availability;Bandwidth;Internet;Educational technology","computer aided instruction;computer games;virtual reality","computer games;e-learning tools;lifelong learning;storytelling;virtual learning environment","","5","","38","","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is closely linked to automated aspects of sensorimotor control and understood to depend on one's ability to monitor the details of one's movements. As such SoA has been argued to be a critical component of self-awareness in general and contribute to presence in virtual reality environments in particular. A common approach to investigating SoA is to ask participants to perform goal-directed movements and introducing spatial or temporal visuomotor mismatches in the feedback. Feedback movements are traditionally either switched with someone else's movements using a 2D video-feed or modified by providing abstracted feedback about one's actions on a computer screen. The aim of the current study was to quantify conscious monitoring and the SoA for ecologically valid, three dimensional feedback of the participants' actual limb and movements. This was achieved by displaying an Infra-Red (IR) feed of the participants' upper limbs in an augmented virtuality environment (AVE) using a head-mounted display (HMD). Movements could be fed back in real-time (46ms system delay) or with an experimental delay of up to 570ms. As hypothesized, participant's SoA decreased with increasing temporal visuomotor mismatches (p<;.001), replicating previous findings and extending them to AVEs. In-line with this literature, we report temporal limits of 222±60ms (50% psychometric threshold) in N=28 participants. Our results demonstrate the validity of the experimental platform by replicating studies in SoA both qualitatively and quantitatively. We discuss our findings in relation to the use of virtual and mixed reality in research and implications for neurorehabilitation therapies.","","978-1-5090-1897-0","10.1109/SMC.2016.7844679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7844679","augmented virtuality;sense of agency;presence;sensory integration;movement feedback;motion capture","Delays;Visualization;Feeds;Real-time systems;Training;Conferences;Cybernetics","augmented reality;helmet mounted displays;human computer interaction","temporal agency limits;SoA;sense of agency;infrared feed;IR feed;augmented virtuality environment;head-mounted display;temporal visuomotor mismatches;mixed reality;HMD;AVE","","1","","19","","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a realtime simulation, air traffic controllers detected aircraft conflicts, assisted by an automated tool which was very reliable in normal situations, but less so in Free Flight (FF) scenarios where certain aircraft deviated from their flight plans. One group of participants was given a small amount of pre-experiment training, being informed that the automation reliability would suffer in these scenarios. As hypothesized, subjective trust was lower in FF for the trained participants. Overall performance did not differ, but the trained group were more likely to detect both real and perceived conflicts (bias shift). Also, they were more likely in general to unquestioningly accept the automation's judgments (which in general was appropriate), as assessed by a new experimental scale of self-reported use-of-information.

Effective screening of passenger bags using state-of-the-art X-ray screening systems is essential to prevent terrorist attacks. The performance of the screening process depends critically on the security personnel, because they decide whether bags are OK or whether they might contain a prohibited item. Screening X-ray images of passenger bags for dangerous and prohibited items effectively and efficiently is a demanding object recognition task. Effectiveness of computer-based training (CBT) on X-ray detection performance was assessed using computer-based tests and on the job performance measures using threat image projection (TIP). It was found that adaptive CBT is a powerful tool to increase detection performance and efficiency of screeners in X-ray image interpretation. Moreover, the results of training could be generalized to the real life situation as shown in the increased detection performance in TIP not only for trained items, but also for new (untrained) items.

More HB was provided if the participants' achieved MEF pattern deviated from the target. Otherwise, less HB was provided. The deviation between the participants' achieved MEF and the target, as well as the mean achieved MEF, were computed before, during and after the training session. During the training, participants generally exceeded the target pattern at the beginning of the push cycle and achieved it towards the end. On average, participants also increased their mean MEF by up to 15.7% on the right side and 12.4% on the left side between the pre-training and training periods.

We present a decomposition approach to the automated design of perceptually augmented simulations, and we describe a user-study of the training effectiveness of a search-task simulator designed using our approach vs. an un-augmented simulator.

At the same time, different crews / groups creating the participants' experience resort to different scenarios, which can finally lead to absolutely unlike results including those that concern flight safety. In the course of a game situation, pilots can see the interaction process, on the one hand, and they are engaged into it, on the other hand. Everyone resorts to their own scenario and can see what their actions lead to in the end of the game. During the game, one could study how leadership skills are demonstrated and how situational understanding of any following action is formed by the group when a passenger in a game situation spontaneously assumes responsibility and says: “Landed ...”, i.e. the game generates a chain of the situations that requests decision-making.

Conventional wisdom holds that data gloves need calibration in order to obtain accurate results. However, calibration is a time-consuming process, inherently user-specific, and its results are often not perfect. In contrast, the present study aims at evaluating recognition methods that do not require prior calibration of the data glove, by using raw sensor readings as input features and mapping them directly to different categories of hand shapes. An experiment was carried out, where test persons wearing a data glove had to grasp physical objects of different shapes corresponding to the various grasp types of the Schlesinger taxonomy. The collected data was analyzed with 28 classifiers including different types of neural networks, decision trees, Bayes nets, and lazy learners. Each classifier was analyzed in six different settings, representing various application scenarios with differing generalization demands. The results of this work are twofold: (1) We show that a reasonably well to highly reliable recognition of grasp types can be achieved - depending on whether or not the glove user is among those training the classifier - even with uncalibrated data gloves. (2) We identify the best performing classification methods for recognition of various grasp types. To conclude, cumbersome calibration processes before productive usage of data gloves can be spared in many situations.","2375-5334","1-4244-0905-5","10.1109/VR.2007.352459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161001","Data Glove;Calibration;Grasp Recognition;Classification Methods;I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniques¿Interaction techniques;I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism¿[Virtual Reality]","Data gloves;Calibration;Shape;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Testing;Taxonomy;Data analysis;Classification tree analysis;Neural networks;Decision trees","calibration;data gloves;pattern classification;virtual prototyping;virtual reality","grasp recognition;uncalibrated data gloves;classification methods;object manipulation;Schlesinger taxonomy;cumbersome calibration","","31","","24","","23 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking into account fast dynamics on large system is a real challenge for the simulation engine of a DTS. Indeed, in order to represent effectively the reaction of the power system, the simulation must be carried out very close to real-time. The PEGASE project addressed this challenge on the European Transmission Network (ETN). Many different algorithms were investigated and several have been implemented in a prototype based on FAST, a full-dynamic DTS simulation engine developed by Tractebel Engineering S.A. and integrated in the Energy Management System (EMS) of several TSO's.

An early detailed individualized assessment and treatment intervention for older adults with preexisting conditions is recommend, but the workload for physicians is high and training is often perceived as boring because exercises generally do not change that often. In this paper we introduce a seated VR exergame for fall prevention of older adults. The game has been designed and developed together with clinical experts and therapists to provide adequate fall prevention exercises, which can be implemented in patients daily schedules and administered through a VR exergame. Movements that control the exergame match the motions suggested by our partner physicians and improve balance by shifting the players center of mass.","","978-1-7281-6532-5","10.1109/VRW50115.2020.00063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090601","Human-centered computing;Human-computer interaction (HCI);Interaction Paradigms;virtual reality","Training;Cameras;Medical treatment;Assisted living;Task analysis;Torso","biomechanics;biomedical equipment;computer games;diseases;geriatrics;patient care;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;virtual reality","safe therapies;assisted living facilities;treatment intervention;seated VR exergame;fall prevention exercises","","","","10","","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results show that while training in both Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE) and Desktop (non-immersive) Virtual Environment (DVE) resulted in a significant improvement on relative motion problem solving test in general, the IVE group performed significantly better than the DVE group on solving two-dimensional relative motion problems after training in the simulations. This result supports our hypothesis that egocentric encoding of the scene in IVE (where the learner constitutes a part of a scene being immersed in it) as compared to allocentric encoding on a computer screen in DVI (where the earner is looking on the scene from “outside”) is beneficial for studying two-dimensional problems.","","978-1-4673-5112-6","10.1109/IEDEC.2013.6526781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526781","Virtual Environment;Educational Technology;Immersivity;Relative Motion","Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Switches;Abstracts;Reliability;Real-time systems;Virtual reality","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;teaching;user interfaces;virtual reality","immersive virtual reality system;non immersive virtual reality system;relative motion concept learning;relative motion concept teaching;desktop virtual environment;IVE;DVE;motion problem solving test;educational technology","","2","","14","","10 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The practice of HCTS continues to grow at rapid pace throughout all of the healthcare disciplines, however research in this field still in its early stage. Increasingly, decision makers and developer look forward to offer more sophisticated, much larger, and more complex HCTS to serve the desired outcome and improve the quality and safety of patient care. Due to the rapidly increasing usage of personal mobile devices and the need of executing HCTS applications in environments that have no previous network infrastructure available, Mobile Health Care Training-based System (MHCTS) is an expected future trend. In such systems, medical staff will share and collaborate in a 3D virtual environment through their mobile devices in an ad-hoc network (MANET) in order to accomplish specific missions' typically surgical emergency room. Users are organized into various groups (Radiologists, Maternity departments, and General surgery etc.), and need to be managed by a multicast scheme to save network bandwidth and offer immersive sense. MHCTS are sensitive to networking issues, since interactive 3D graphics requires additional load due to the use of mobile devices. Therefore, we need to emphasize on the importance and the improvement of multicast techniques for the effectiveness of MHCTS and the management of collaborative group interaction. Research so far has devoted little attention to the network communication protocols design of such systems which is crucial to preserve the sense of immersion for participating users. In this paper, we investigate the effect of multicast routing protocol in advancing the field of Health care Training-based System to the benefit of patient's safety, and health care professional. A comprehensive analysis about various ad-hoc multicast routing protocols is proposed. The selection key factors for the right protocol for MHCTS applications were safety and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this work will be the first initiative involving systematic literature reviews to identify a research gate for the use of multicast protocol in health care simulation learning community.","","978-1-4799-3166-8","10.1109/ICeND.2014.6991355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6991355","Ad-hoc;Multicast Protocol;Health care training system;3D Virtual Environment","Routing;Routing protocols;Medical services;Virtual environments;Peer-to-peer computing;Multicast protocols","biomedical communication;computer based training;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;multicast protocols;routing protocols;virtual reality","multicast routing protocols;mobile health care training systems;MHCTS;3D virtual environment;VE;mobile ad-hoc network;MANET","","","","21","","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper outlines an investigation by a commercial research organization (BHP Research) into the applications of this technology. The major domain under investigation was that of petroleum exploration. The focus of the research was two-fold, namely, the use of virtual environments to enable multi-sensory interpretation of data and the ability of virtual environments to enhance collaboration amongst work teams. Appraisal was conducted by trialing the applications amongst a wide user base. While it is not possible to divulge in full the recommendations that resulted from this work, a number of observations are made about the use of this technology for petroleum exploration.

Common treatment to restore the functionality of the paralyzed limb is by doing motoric therapy. This therapy was done in hospital and was monitored by therapists. However, most of the post-stroke patients choose not to do therapy since their access to hospital is difficult or their motivation to do therapy is low. To overcome the limitations of traditional therapy methods some interactive game-based therapy systems were introduced i.e: AR-therapy and Wii-based movement therapy. Unfortunately, their performance is low due to user ergonomic factor problem. In this study, we proposed a virtual reality system for sitting to standing and walking therapy for post-stroke patients called KOMY. This application is integrated with Kinect technology. Four VR game-based training tasks were adopted from sitting to standing therapy and walking therapy that was done by therapist. These tasks are sitting-standing-sitting, moving leg aside, moving leg freely, and walking. Each task has tree difficulty level. From observation that involving post-stroke patient, elderly healthy people, and therapist, we find that all of them give positive comment to this application. They said that this application not only can be used for therapy of post-stroke patients but also can be used for exercise to elderly. Further, KOMY can be used as alternative for playing therapy and home education therapy.","","978-1-5090-0096-8","10.1109/ICTS.2015.7379889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379889","Sitting and Standing Therapy;Walking Therapy;Kinect;Virtual Reality","Decision support systems;Information and communication technology","computer games;patient treatment;virtual reality","sitting to standing therapy;Kinect technology;KOMY;VR game-based training task;virtual reality system;poststroke patient therapy;walking therapy","","3","1","10","","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although traditional invasive surgery training system can complete general training work, real-time performance and accuracy of most training system failed to meet the requirements of training work. Therefore, in this study, three parts, including 3D modeling, collision detection algorithm and application architecture were improved in the existing training system. Firstly, an improved Marching cubes algorithm was adopted to simplify the mathematical modeling of vessels by merging the related points of the mesh model. Secondly, a hybrid collision detection algorithm was proposed and implemented. Lastly, the CPU-GPU parallel computing architecture was adopted. Particularly, the design of the improved VR-based system and the experimental results were presented and analyzed. Moreover, experimental results showed that the proposed system was beneficial to improve the skill of surgeons in manipulating the catheter and guide wire.

Four subjects were studied with event-related fMRI while doing simple paretic hand finger movements before (double baseline) and after training. Bilateral hand movements were recorded and used to provide real-time feedback to subjects during scanning to eliminate performance confounds on fMRI results. The kinematic parameters of each movement were also used in the general linear model with the BOLD signal to investigate training-induced changes in neuromotor coupling. Univariate analysis showed an increase in BOLD signal in the ipsilesional hemisphere in two subjects and a decrease in activity in the other two subjects. Seed voxel based functional connectivity analysis revealed an increase in connectivity between ipsilesional motor cortex and bilateral sensorimotor cortex during finger movements in all four subjects. Hemispheric laterality index values showed a tendency to decrease reflecting a reduction in the over-dominance of the contralesional hemisphere. The study is novel in terms of 1) tracking finger movement during a motor task in the scanner, 2) monitoring motor performance during the experiment and 3) giving online visual feedback of subjects' movement. This pilot study introduces a novel approach to study neural plasticity by combining measures of regional intensity, interregional interactions (using functional connectivity analysis and hemispheric laterality index), and modulation in the strength of neuromotor coupling.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6092002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092002","","Training;Robot sensing systems;Thumb;Angular velocity;Kinematics;Couplings","biomechanics;biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;medical image processing;medical robotics;neurophysiology;virtual reality","neural reorganization;chronic stroke;virtual reality training;brain reorganization;robot-assisted arm;hand training;event-related fMRI;paretic hand finger movements;bilateral hand movements;real-time feedback;BOLD signal;univariate analysis;functional connectivity analysis;ipsilesional motor cortex;bilateral sensorimotor cortex;tracking finger movement;online visual feedback;neural plasticity;hemispheric laterality index;neuromotor coupling","Aged;Chronic Disease;Female;Functional Laterality;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Net;Nervous System;Oxygen;Robotics;Stroke;Stroke;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface","9","","20","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Potential hazards are common in construction sites due to the variability and open elevated working environment. Hazard identification, detecting and correcting potential hazards before an accident occurs, is one of practical and effective methods that are commonly adopted. However, hazard identification relies on tacit knowledge that requires sufficient experience. The current training of trainees (e.g., inspectors and students) in general still relies on lectures to provide them with the knowledge on safety management, regulation, and past accidental cases. Such traditional lectures are not effective in nourishing the required identification ability. This research created a 3D digit construction site model, and developed an interactive hazard-identification game that allows trainees to have realistic hands-on identification experience. We also designed an experiment to evaluate the learning effects and satisfactions of the hazard-identification game as compared with the traditional lectures. The results showed that the hazard-identification game was significantly (p <; 0.001) better than the traditional lectures in safety education and training. Also, the students satisfied with the game-based training courses significantly (p <; 0.001) more than the other students satisfied with the traditional courses. Virtual environment provides the feasibility of creating various types of job sites and hazards depending on the training objectives, and allows trainees to learn by experiencing in a safe environment. This research establishes and develops a game-based hazard identification training system, which can improve trainees' learning effectiveness and learning satisfaction. The training system can also improve workers' and site managers' hazard awareness, and help them find hazards in their workplace.","","978-1-4673-7682-2","10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7382339","3D;construction game;hazard identification;virtual environment;safety training and education","Training;Hazards;Games;Construction industry;Accidents","accident prevention;computer based training;computer games;construction industry;hazards;occupational safety","3D game-based training system;construction industry;potential hazard detection;potential hazard correction;open elevated working environment;inspector training;student training;safety management;safety regulation;past accidental cases;3D digit construction site model;interactive hazard-identification game;hands-on identification experience;safety education;safety training;game-based training courses;virtual environment;job sites;training objectives;trainee learning effectiveness;learning satisfaction;workers;site manager hazard awareness","","4","","22","","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The contents include extraction methods for element colors, calculation methods for layout perceptual features and color-matching perceptual features, and pairwise comparison methods for style features. By overfitting the distribution of geometric features in the data, the model can predict the probability density distribution of features such as element position and color under specific conditions to support the generation of flat images. To construct a prediction model, the sampling method of features, the model optimization method, and the data learning strategy are investigated. This thesis involves the design and implementation of a lossless/near-lossless compression system for high-frame-rate gaze camera image data, which is faced with the technical problems of high fidelity and strong real-time and reliable compression. The image single-frame lossless/near-loss-free compression ratio is generally low, and the compression ratio can be improved by using the correlation between image frames.

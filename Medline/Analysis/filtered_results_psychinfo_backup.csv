Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) is being used for educational virtual field trips (VFTs) involving scenarios that may be too difficult, dangerous or expensive to experience in real life. We implemented an immersive VFT within the investigation phase of an inquiry-based learning (IBL) climate change intervention. Students investigated the consequences of climate change by virtually traveling to Greenland and exploring albedo and greenhouse effects first hand. A total of 102 seventh and eighth grade students were randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions: (1) narrated pretraining followed by IVR exploration or (2) the same narrated training material integrated within the IVR exploration. Students in both conditions showed significant increases in declarative knowledge, self-efficacy, interest, STEM intentions, outcome expectations and intentions to change behavior from the pre- to post-assessment. However, there was a significant difference between conditions favoring the pretraining group on a transfer test consisting of an oral presentation to a fictitious UN panel. The findings suggest that educators can choose to present important prerequisite learning content before or during a VFT. However, adding pretraining may lead to better transfer test performance, presumably because it helps reduce cognitive load while learning in IVR.

Edited Book",Chapter,"The potential transfer of visual-perceptual-motor skill from one context to another is vital for successful achievement of motor skill goal(s) within sports. This chapter provides a synopsis of existing knowledge about transfer in sport, with the view that such a synopsis might generate ideas for further scientific inquiry, as well as helping to guide coach and player development. Transfer is discussed in terms of the following discriminators of expert performance in sport: anticipation; pattern recall; pattern recognition; and decision making. The chapter defines anticipation as the capability to use visual information in the immediate environment to predict what will occur in order to achieve the motor skill goal. It discusses empirical evidence of transfer within sports relative to performance and learning, encompassing video simulation, virtual reality, or in situ methodologies. The chapter also discusses empirical evidence of transfer between sports and, in particular, in regard to the sampling of sports. It describes theories of transfer and studies that have attempted to test theoretical predictions. The chapter suggests practical applications for practitioners based upon theory and empirical findings. It outlines future research directions that require focussed investigation to advance understanding of transfer, which, in turn, can help advance what is known in the field of sport expertise and skill learning.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"When learning new information, contextual information about the encoding situation is stored in addition to the focal memory content. Later, these strings of extra information can help retrieve the learned content as demonstrated by experiments where contextual cues from an encoding situation facilitate remembering and improve memory performance when reinstated during retrieval. This context-dependent memory effect has been investigated over the course of several decades and has been demonstrated with many different types of contexts. Based on this, the widely held belief is that context-dependent memory is a strong and robust effect, with transferable substance for everyday learning and potential clinical applications. Here we report the results of a multi-study design investigating the influence of reinstated visual contexts on memory performance. Data from 120 participants were included in three studies comprising a variety of visual cues. We show convincingly that even rich, salient and fully surrounding visual contexts provided by virtual reality are not sufficient to induce effects of context-dependency in a free recall memory task. We also investigated contextual modulation of oscillatory brain activity in order to test the effect of reinstated neural contexts, which failed to evoke a robust effect when re-tested in an internal conceptual replication study. Moreover, a Bayesian sequential statistical analysis revealed moderate to strong evidence against the hypothesis that reinstatement of visual contexts benefits free recall memory tasks indicating that effects are small and may not be suitable for transfer into everyday learning.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of playing an immersive virtual reality game that included a collection of gamified cognitive tasks, Cerevrum, on specific components of cognition, including perceptual attention, mental rotation, working memory, visualization, visual field of view, and visual processing speed. Participants completed a pretest of cognitive assessments, played one of the two mini-games within Cerevrum (Stardust or Heroes) for 1.5 hr over three 30-min sessions and then completed a posttest of cognitive assessments and a questionnaire about interest and engagement during the game. An inactive control group completed only the pretest and posttest. Results showed no significant differences among the Heroes group, Stardust group, and control group on the posttest scores, even when controlled for pretest scores. These findings do not support the claim that playing brain-training games for a short period results in transfer of cognitive training to nongame venues.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Grip force has been studied widely in a variety of interaction and movement tasks, however, not much is known about the timing of the grip force control in preparation for interaction with objects. For example, it is unknown whether and how the temporal preparation for a collision is related to (the prediction of) the impact load. To study this question, we examined the anticipative timing of the grip force in preparation for impact loads. We designed a collision task with different types of load forces in a controlled virtual environment. Participants interacted with a robotic device (KINARM, BKIN Technologies, Kingston) whose handles were equipped with force sensors which the participants held in precision grip. Representations of the hand and objects were visually projected on a virtual reality display and forces were applied onto the participant's hand to simulate a collision with the virtual objects. The collisions were alternating between the two hands to allow transfer and learning between the hands. The results show that there is immediate transfer of object information between the two hands, since the grip force levels are (almost) fully adjusted after one collision with the opposite hand. The results also show that the grip force levels are nicely adjusted based on the mass and stiffness of the object. Surprisingly, the temporal onset of the grip force build up did not depend on the impact load, so that participants avoid slippage by adjusting the other grip force characteristics (e.g., grip force level and rate of change), therefore considering these self-imposed timing constraints. With the use of catch trials, for which no impact occurred, we further analyzed the temporal profile of the grip force. The catch trial data showed that the timing of the grip force peak is also independent of the impact load and its timing, which suggests a time-locked planning of the complete grip force profile.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Although virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool for the investigation of episodic memory phenomena, to date there has been relatively little examination of how learning mechanisms operate in VR and how these processes might compare (or contrast) with learning that occurs in real life. Moreover, the existing literature on this topic is spread across several disciplines and uses various distinct apparatuses, thus obscuring whether the differences that exist between studies might be due to genuine theoretical discrepancies or may be more simply explained by accounting for methodological variations. The current review is designed to address and elucidate several issues relevant to psychological researchers interested in understanding and/or using this technological approach to study episodic memory phenomena. The principle objectives of the review are as follows: (a) defining and discussing the various VR systems currently used for research purposes, (b) compiling research of episodic memory effects in VR as they have been studied across several disciplines, and (c) surveying major topics in this body of literature (e.g., how virtual immersion has an impact on memory; transfer effects from VR to the real world). The content of this review is designed to serve as a resource for psychologists interested in learning more about the current state of research in this field and is intended to highlight the capabilities (and constraints) associated with using this technological approach in episodic memory research.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We explored visuomotor adaptation and spatial generalization of three-dimensional reaching movements performed in a virtual reality environment. We used a multiphase learning paradigm. First, subjects performed reaching movements to six targets without visual feedback (VF) (pre-exposure phase). Next, participants aimed at one target with veridical VF (baseline phase). Immediately after, they were required to adapt their movements to a triaxial visuomotor perturbation (horizontal, vertical, and sagittal translations) between actual hand motion and VF of hand motion in the virtual environment (learning phase). Finally, subjects aimed at the same targets as in the baseline (aftereffect) and pre-exposure phases (generalization) without VF (post-exposure phase). The results revealed spatial axis-dependent visuomotor adaptation capacities. First, subjects showed smaller intertrial variability along the horizontal compared to the sagittal and vertical axes during the baseline and learning phases. Second, although subjects were unaware of the visual distortion, they adapted their movements to each component of the triaxial perturbation. However, they showed reduced learning rate and less persistent adaptation (aftereffect) along the vertical than the horizontal and sagittal axes. Similarly, subjects transferred the newly learned visuomotor association to untrained regions of the workspace, but their average level of generalization was smaller along the vertical than the horizontal and sagittal axes. Collectively, our results suggest that adapting three-dimensional movements to a visual distortion involves distinct processes according to the specific sensorimotor integration demands of moving along each spatial axis. This finding supports the idea that the brain employs a modular decomposition strategy to simplify complex multidimensional visuomotor tasks.

Edited Book",Chapter,"Transhumanism, which emerges as a movement of thought, stands out with the developments such as artificial organs, brain-to-brain knowledge and learning transfer and smart robots in the 21st century. One of these technologies, where we see early applications with the goal of reaching the post-human, is the virtual worlds. Some features of the post-humans, which can now be experienced through 3 dimensional immersive virtual worlds in a certain scale, also reveal the fact that the existing virtual worlds are a limited simulation of a transhumanist future. While the virtual worlds and transhumanism perspective is expected to be effective in various areas of human life, it will be inevitable for these effects to manifest themselves in learning processes. In this sense, evaluation of surrounding learning by virtual worlds is the main objective of this chapter. For this purpose, virtual worlds in the transhumanism age were tried to be evaluated under learning context by using anime series and film samples which are yet considered as sci-fi.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality (VR) simulates real-world scenarios by creating a sense of presence in its users. Such immersive scenarios lead to behavior that is more similar to that displayed in real world settings, which may facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills acquired in VR to similar real world situations. VR has already been used in education, psychotherapy, rehabilitation and it comes as an appealing choice for training intervention purposes. The aim of the present study was to investigate to what extent VR technology for games presented via goggles can be used in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner (MRI), addressing the question of whether brain connectivity differs between VR stimulation via goggles and a presentation from a screen via mirror projection. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether stereoscopic goggle stimulation, where both eyes receive different visual input, would elicit stronger brain connectivity than a stimulation in which both eyes receive the same visual input (monoscopic). To our knowledge, there is no previous research using games and functional connectivity (FC) in MRI to address this question. Multiple analyses approaches were taken so that different aspects of brain connectivity could be covered: fractional low-frequency fluctuation, independent component analysis (ICA), seed-based FC (SeedFC) and graph analysis. In goggle presentation (mono and stereoscopic) as contrasted to screen, we found differences in brain activation in left cerebellum and postcentral gyrus as well as differences in connectivity in the visual cortex and frontal inferior cortex [when focusing on the visual and default mode network (DMN)]. When considering connectivity in specific areas of interest, we found higher connectivity between bilateral superior frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, as well as bilateral inferior parietal cortex with right calcarine and right lingual cortex. Furthermore, we found superior frontal cortex and insula/putamen to be more strongly connected in goggle stereoscopic vs. goggle monoscopic, in line with our hypothesis. We assume that the condition that elicits higher brain connectivity values should be most suited for long-term brain training interventions given that, extended training under these conditions could permanently improve brain connectivity on a functional as well as on a structural level.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In recent years, virtual reality has become prevalent in many educational settings. In this study, virtual reality-based behavioral skills training (VR-BST) approach is proposed to teach basic behavioral skills for fire safety. A virtual reality-based environment was designed and implemented in the context of the design-based research. A group of ten primary school students received a basic fire safety training package through this environment and in situ training was implemented when needed. The results indicated that students' fire safety behavioral skills significantly improved with the use of virtual reality based training and the majority of the students could transfer their behavioral skills to real environments. The way of modelling the behaviors in this study and integrating in situ training into the learning environment positively contributed to the development of behavioral skills. The study concludes with suggestions for practitioners and researchers in the field of virtual reality for behavioral skills training.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There are increasing new advances in virtual reality technologies as well as a rise in learning virtual environments for which several studies highlighted the pedagogical value, knowledge transfer, and learners' engaged-behaviors. Moreover, the notion of user experience is now abundant in the scientific literature without the fact that there are specific models for immersive environments. This paper aims at proposing and validating a model of User experience in immersive Virtual Environment, including virtual learning environments. The model is composed of 10 components extracted from existing models (i.e., presence, engagement, immersion, flow, usability, skill, emotion, experience consequence, judgement, and technology adoption). It was validated in a user study involving 152 participants who were asked to use the edutainment application Think and Shoot and to complete an immersive virtual environment questionnaire. The findings lead us to a modified user experience model questioning new paths between user experience components (e.g., the influence of experience consequence on flow).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We present how immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology can be used for interpersonal skills training in organizations. We review the distinguishing features of IVR and its potential strengths and limitations for interpersonal skills training. There is a pressing need for more empirical evidence, which is why we propose a research agenda with the aim of establishing IVR interpersonal skills training in the domain of human resource development. The proposed research agenda encompasses a set of 10 hypotheses that cover two axes: (a) factors that affect training transfer and (b) personality characteristics. We illustrate how these hypotheses can be tested empirically and discuss limitations and future roles for HRD scholars in such research.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The Broadening Experiences in Scientific Experiences (BEST) program at Wayne State University was designed to increase doctoral students' awareness of multiple employment sectors beyond academia, improve their knowledge of transferable skills required to succeed in any career path, provide opportunities to explore diverse career paths, and gain indepth knowledge about those paths using experiential learning opportunities. We devised a three-phase program that ranged from providing students with a broad introduction to multiple career opportunities to immersive experiential learning in a specific career sector. Importantly, program content was developed and delivered by alumni and industry experts in five employment sectors+/-business/industry, communication, government, law/regulatory affairs, and undergraduate/PUI teaching+/-in partnership with WSU faculty. This article provides data on two notable outcomes: doctoral students participate equally in BEST activities regardless of gender, race, and citizenship status, and student participation in BEST activities did not correlate with lower GRE ratings, lower GPA, or increased time-to-degree. Further, a halo effect of the program is evidenced by participation of students from all disciplines, not just the biomedical sciences. Centralizing BEST activities within the Graduate School will allow faculty and individual programs to save resources and time.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Obstacle crossing, such as stepping over a curb, becomes more challenging with natural aging and could lead to obstacle-related trips and falls. To reduce fall-risk, obstacle training programs using physical obstacles have been developed, but come with space and human resource constraints. These barriers could be removed by using a virtual obstacle crossing training program, but only if the learned gait characteristics transfer to a real environment. We examined whether virtual environment obstacle crossing behavior is transferred to crossing real environment obstacles. Forty participants (n = 20 younger adults and n = 20 older adults) completed two sessions of virtual environment obstacle crossing, which was preceded and followed by one session of real environment obstacle crossing. Participants learned to cross the virtual obstacle more safely and that change in behavior was transferred to the real environment via increased foot clearance and alterations in foot placement before and after the real environment obstacle. Further, while both age groups showed transfer to the real environment task, they differed on the limb in which their transfer effects applied. This suggests it is plausible to use virtual reality training to enhance gait characteristics in the context of obstacle avoidance, potentially leading to a novel way to reduce fall-risk.

As a result, there is an urgency to determine how to effectively rehabilitate younger survivors. In order to do so, we must ascertain the manner in which all ages learn gait tasks, specifically through adaptation. Subsequently, we will be able to adequately address unique characteristics posed by different aged survivors in order to optimize functional improvement. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of age on adaptation of spatiotemporal gait parameters. 57 healthy participants were divided into three groups: young (20 to 40 years), middle (41 to 60) and older (61 years +) and 35 stroke survivors into two groups: younger (20 to 60 years) and older (61 years +). All participants completed a novel walking paradigm on a dual-belt treadmill. Subjects were randomly assigned to complete the paradigm either in a Virtual Reality environment or in front of a static environment. Six spatiotemporal parameters were calculated for early learning, late learning, adaptation and transfer stages. Overall adaptive capabilities were preserved for all ages of healthy and stroke survivors. Additionally, aging exposes mechanistic differences in spatiotemporal adaptation of healthy individuals. In the absence of visual feedback, the system relies upon vestibular and proprioceptive feedback. The effect of age may materialize as a result of a deteriorating vestibular system emerging in middle-age, as well as morphological differences in the cerebellum. The addition of optic flow appears to resolve the age- related sensorimotor decrements allowing adaptation to occur based upon exteroceptive feedback. When examining age on gait adaptation in stroke survivors, we not only observe the aforementioned aging process, but also introduce differing mechanisms of adaptive control between ages illustrating the importance of a healthy cerebellar-cortical network for appropriate gait adaptation. Finally, the presence of visual feedback appears to resolve the issues discovered in the adaption of stroke survivors, and therefore brings about mechanistic similarities in adaptation between age.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"An influential idea in cognitive neuroscience is that perception and action are highly separable brain functions, implemented in distinct neural systems. In particular, this theory predicts that the functional distinction between grasping, a skilled action, and manual estimation, a type of perceptual report, should be mirrored by a split between their respective control systems. This idea has received support from a variety of dissociations, yet many of these findings have been criticized for failing to pinpoint the source of the dissociation. In this study, we devised a novel approach to this question, first targeting specific grasp control mechanisms through visuomotor adaptation, then testing whether adapted mechanisms were also involved in manual estimation-a response widely characterized as perceptual in function. Participants grasped objects in virtual reality that could appear larger or smaller than the actual physical sizes felt at the end of each grasp. After brief exposure to a size perturbation, manual estimates were biased in the same direction as the maximum grip apertures of grasping movements, indicating that the adapted mechanism is active in both tasks, regardless of the perception-action distinction. Additional experiments showed that the transfer effect generalizes broadly over space (Exp. 1B) and does not appear to arise from a change in visual perception (Exp. 2). We discuss two adaptable mechanisms that could have mediated the observed effect: (a) an afferent proprioceptive mechanism for sensing grip shape; and (b) an efferent visuomotor transformation of size information into a grip-shaping motor command.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: The aims of this study were to assess whether computerized attentional training improves dual-tasking abilities in older adults and whether its effect and transfer are modulated by age and the type of training provided. This study also used virtual reality (VR) as a proxy to measure transfer in a real life related context. Method: Sixty participants (30 older and 30 younger adults) were randomized to either: (a) single-task training (two tasks practiced in focused attention; visual detection and alphanumeric equation task); or (b) divided attention variable-priority training (varying the amount of attention to put on each task when performed concurrently). Training effects were assessed at pre- and post-training with tasks similar to the one used in training. Transfer was measured with the virtual car ride, an immersive dual-task scenario and a self-reported questionnaire. Results: In older adults, variable-priority improved attentional control abilities and led to better transfer in the VR dual-task scenario compared with single-task. Younger adults benefited equally from the two types of training and transfer was found on the Alpha span task when performed concurrently in VR. Single-task improved the ability of all participants to carry out the tasks in the focused attention condition. No transfer effects were found on the self-reported measure for either training type or age. Conclusion: Attention remains plastic in old age and programs designed to improve attentional control might be beneficial to older adults. Importantly, training can produce transfer to more real life related tasks and transfer remains possible throughout the life span. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)
Impact Statement
General Scientific Summary-This study shows the importance of selecting the appropriate training program on the basis of (a) what we want to improve and (b) the population to which it is addressed. Indeed, older adults were found to benefit to a larger extent than younger adults from a training targeting attentional control abilities (for which difficulties were found prior to training), and that this training gain may transfer to tasks of everyday life.

Though they have potential benefits, students sometimes experience a steep learning curve and discomfort with the technology (Warburton, 2009). This study explored how students in two American Studies classes using Second Life rated their own levels of virtual world self-efficacy at early and late stages of using it, the factors they felt influenced their self-efficacy, their attitudes and perceptions about its learning value, and the way that students with different degrees of change in self-efficacy viewed its learning value. The study was supported with literature about self-efficacy, and some of the ways it has influenced online teaching and learning. The research questions were explored quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative data came from a survey developed for measuring self-efficacy at early and late stages of use. Qualitative data came mainly from interviews with a smaller group of students about the development of their virtual world skills and their perceptions of its learning value. While self-efficacy generally increased in the survey population, interviewees experienced both internal and external barriers and enabling factors contributing to self-efficacy development. Resources and support, as well as increased immersiveness, contributed to positive self-efficacy. Some data supported the idea that increased self-efficacy helped promote positive learning perceptions. However, the more social learning activities were the ones that promoted strongest perceptions of learning value for students.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: To assess advanced communication skills among second-year medical students exposed either to a computer simulation (MPathic-VR) featuring virtual humans, or to a multimedia computer-based learning module, and to understand each group's experiences and learning preferences. Methods: A single-blinded, mixed methods, randomized, multisite trial compared MPathic-VR (N = 210) to computer-based learning (N = 211). Primary outcomes: communication scores during repeat interactions with MPathic-VR's intercultural and interprofessional communication scenarios and scores on a subsequent advanced communication skills objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare outcomes. Secondary outcomes: student attitude surveys and qualitative assessments of their experiences with MPathic-VR or computer-based learning. Results: MPathic-VR-trained students improved their intercultural and interprofessional communication performance between their first and second interactions with each scenario. They also achieved significantly higher composite scores on the OSCE than computer-based learning-trained students. Attitudes and experiences were more positive among students trained with MPathic-VR, who valued its providing immediate feedback, teaching nonverbal communication skills, and preparing them for emotion-charged patient encounters. Conclusions: MPathic-VR was effective in training advanced communication skills and in enabling knowledge transfer into a more realistic clinical situation. Practice implications: MPathic-VR's virtual human simulation offers an effective and engaging means of advanced communication training.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality (VR) is predicted to create a paradigm shift in education and training, but there is little empirical evidence of its educational value. The main objectives of this study were to determine the consequences of adding immersive VR to virtual learning simulations, and to investigate whether the principles of multimedia learning generalize to immersive VR. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to obtain a direct measure of cognitive processing during learning. A sample of 52 university students participated in a 2 x 2 experimental cross-panel design wherein students learned from a science simulation via a desktop display (PC) or a head-mounted display (VR); and the simulations contained on-screen text or on-screen text with narration. Across both text versions, students reported being more present in the VR condition (d = 1.30); but they learned less (d = 0.80), and had significantly higher cognitive load based on the EEG measure (d = 0.59). In spite of its motivating properties (as reflected in presence ratings), learning science in VR may overload and distract the learner (as reflected in EEG measures of cognitive load), resulting in less opportunity to build learning outcomes (as reflected in poorer learning outcome test performance).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Young people now must compete in a global, knowledge-based, innovation-centered economy; they must acquire not just academic knowledge, but also character attributes such as intrinsic motivation, persistence, and flexibility. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the National Research Council (2012) of the United States recommends the use of ""deeper learning"" classroom strategies. These include case-based learning, multiple representations of knowledge, collaborative learning, apprenticeships, life-wide learning, learning for transfer, interdisciplinary studies, personalized learning, connected learning, and diagnostic assessments. Immersive media (virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, mixed and augmented realities) have affordances that enhance this type of learning. EcoXPT is an inquiry-based middle school curriculum on ecosystem science that invites students into immersive experimentation with scaffolding tools that support deeper learning. This includes a case-based approach situated in an unfolding eutrophication scenario in which students learn new information from their observations over space and time, speaking with virtual characters in the world, and gathering information in the field guide and other sources. Diagnostic assessments of students' progress are based on multiple sources, including process data from various types of logfiles. Multiple varied forms of representation convey perceptual, graphical, and experimental data, enabling students to investigate relationships between variables. Students are apprenticed in the ways of knowing of ecosystems scientists, which involves interdisciplinary knowledge. Students collaborate in teams of two, subdividing the tasks of gathering evidence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality is a frequently used tool in vocational training. Nevertheless, its efficiency has not been systematically tested. The main goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a virtual environment (VE) for learning a complex procedure in the biomedical domain. Two experiments were performed. The first one assessed internal validity of the VE, which is the effectiveness of using a VE in the process of learning a new procedure. The second one tested external validity of the VE, which is the participants' ability to reproduce the acquired skills in a real context. We find that internal and external validity must be evaluated before using a virtual environment in long-term procedure learning. The results of such evaluations are a basis for future experiments aiming to optimize learning conditions in a VE and transferring the acquired skills in a real context.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The motivations for spontaneous phonetic convergence have implications for theories of memory, speech production and perception, social cognition, contact-induced language change, and any number of other phenomena. Thus, this paper examines two distinct but related theoretical positions commonly taken on the motivations for spontaneous phonetic convergence: the Automatist stance and the Interventionist stance. Automatists argue that phonetic convergence is the automatic result of the unmediated action of a perception- production link; of the action of general psychological processes such as priming and simulation effects on linguistic representations in the brain. Interventionists, on the other hand, argue that convergence is the product of the very mediation of the perception-production link, be it linguistic or social mediation, typically for the purpose of managing the social distance between interlocutors. I argue that these seemingly diametrically opposed stances are in fact complementary, not contradictory- having been developed to describe data at various points along a continuum of sociality-and that it is most productive to understand one's own position on the issue from this standpoint. Topics such as exemplar theory, gestural drift, entrainment, and communication accommodation theory are discussed for their relevance to the question at hand.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Age-related impairments during spatial navigation have been widely reported in egocentric and allocentric paradigms. However, the effect of age on more specific navigational components such as the ability to drive or update directional information has not received enough attention. In this study we investigated the effect of age on spatial updating of a visual target after a series of whole-body rotations and transitions using a novel landmark-less virtual reality (VR) environment. Moreover, a significant number of previous studies focused on measures susceptible to a general decline in motor skills such as the spent time navigating, the distance traversed. The current paper proposes a new compound spatial measure to assess navigational performance, examines its reliability and compares its power with those of the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting participants' age and cognitive groups assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Using data from 319 adults (20-83 years), our results confirm the reliability, the age sensitivity, and the cognitive validity of the designed spatial measure as well as its superiority to the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting age and MoCA score. In addition, the results show the significant effect of age cognitive status on spatial updating.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This project developed and studied The Source, an alternate reality game (ARG) designed to foster interest and knowledge related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) among youth from populations underrepresented in STEM fields. ARGs are multiplayer games that engage participants across several media such as shared websites, social media, personal communications, and real-world settings to complete activities and collaborate with team members. The Source was a five-week summer program with 144 participants from Chicago aged 13 to 18 years. The Source incorporated six socio-contextual factors derived from three frameworks: Chang's (ERIC Digest, 2002) recommendations for engaging underrepresented populations in STEM careers, Lave and Wenger's (Cambridge University Press, 1991) situated learning model, and Barron's (Human Development, 49(4); 193-224, 2006) learning ecology perspective. These factors aligned with the program's aims of promoting (1) social community and peer support, (2) collaboration and teamwork, (3) real-world relevance and investigative learning, (4) mentoring and exposure to STEM professionals, (5) hands-on activities to foster transferable skill building, and (6) interface with technology. This paper presents results from 10 focus groups and 10 individual interviews conducted with a subset of the 144 youth participants who completed the game. It describes how these six factors were realized through The Source and uses them as a lens for considering how The Source functioned pedagogically. Qualitative findings describe youth's perception of The Source's potential influence on STEM interest, engagement, and identity formation. Despite limitations, study results indicate that underrepresented youth can engage in an immersive, narrative, and game-based experience as a potential mechanism for piquing and developing STEM interest and skills, particularly among underrepresented youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Research over the past 20 years has consistently shown that egocentric distance is underperceived in virtual environments (VEs) compared with real environments. In 2 experiments, judgments of object distance (Experiment 1) and object size (Experiment 2) improved after a brief period of walking through the VE with continuous visual feedback. Whereas improvement of blind-walking distance judgments could be attributable to recalibration of walking, improvement in perceived size is considered evidence for rescaling of perceived space, whereby perceived size and distance increased after walking interaction. Furthermore, improvements in judged distance and size transferred to a new VE. Distance judgments, but not size judgments, continued to improve after additional walking interaction in the new VE. These results have theoretical implications regarding the effects of walking interaction on perceived space, and practical implications regarding methods of improving perceived distance in VEs.

Impact Statement
Public Significance Statement-Perceived egocentric distance (distance from oneself to another location) is consistently underperceived in virtual reality (VR) compared with relatively accurate real world perception. In this study, a brief period of walking through the virtual environment (VE) with continuous visual feedback improved perceived distance as measured by a walking response and a size response. For both response measures, the improvement caused by walking interaction generalized to a new VE that had not been previously experienced. The finding that improvement generalized to a new VE is of practical significance, and also suggests that the perceptual deficiencies in VR are associated with the VR display rather than the VE itself.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to a general understanding of mental practice by investigating the utility of and participant reaction to a virtual reality maintenance training among underground coal mine first responders. Design/methodology/approach: Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) developed software to provide opportunities for mine rescue team members to learn to inspect, assemble and test their closed-circuit breathing apparatus and to practice those skills. In total, 31 mine rescue team members utilized OMSHR's BG 4 Benching Trainer software and provided feedback to the development team. After training, participants completed a brief post-training questionnaire, which included demographics, perceived training climate and general training evaluation items. Findings: The results overall indicate a generally positive reaction to and high perceived utility of the BG 4 benching software. In addition, the perceived training climate appears to have an effect on the perceived utility of the mental practice virtual reality game, with benchmen from mines with more positive training climates reporting greater perceived efficacy in the training's ability to prepare trainees for real emergencies. Originality/value: This paper helps to broaden current applications of mental practice and is one of the few empirical investigations into a non-rehabilitation virtual reality extension of mental practice. This paper also contributes to the growing literature advocating for greater usage of accurate and well-informed mental practice techniques, tools and methodologies, especially for occupational populations with limitations on exposure to hands-on training.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality trainers are educational tools with great potential for laparoscopic surgery. They can provide basic skills training in a controlled environment and free of risks for patients. They can also offer objective performance assessment without the need for proctors. However, designing effective user interfaces that allow the acquisition of the appropriate technical skills on these systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to examine a process for achieving interface and environment fidelity during the development of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST). Two iterations of the design process were conducted and evaluated. For that purpose, a total of 42 subjects participated in two experimental studies in which two versions of the VBLaST were compared to the accepted standard in the surgical community for training and assessing basic laparoscopic skills in North America, the FLS box-trainer. Participants performed 10 trials of the peg transfer task on each trainer. The assessment of task performance was based on the validated FLS scoring method. Moreover, a subjective evaluation questionnaire was used to assess the fidelity aspects of the VBLaST relative to the FLS trainer. Finally, a focus group session with expert surgeons was conducted as a comparative situated evaluation after the first design iteration. This session aimed to assess the fidelity aspects of the early VBLaST prototype as compared to the FLS trainer. The results indicate that user performance on the earlier version of the VBLaST resulting from the first design iteration was significantly lower than the performance on the standard FLS box-trainer. The comparative situated evaluation with domain experts permitted us to identify some issues related to the visual, haptic and interface fidelity on this early prototype. Results of the second experiment indicate that the performance on the second generation VBLaST was significantly improved as compared to the first generation and not significantly different from that of the standard FLS box-trainer. Furthermore, the subjects rated the fidelity features of the modified VBLaST version higher than the early version. These findings demonstrate the value of the comparative situated evaluation sessions entailing hands on reflection by domain experts to achieve the environment and interface fidelity and training objectives when designing a virtual reality laparoscopic trainer. This suggests that this method could be used successfully in the future to enhance the value of VR systems as an alternative to physical trainers for laparoscopic surgery skills. Some recommendations on how to use this method to achieve the environment and interface fidelity of a VR laparoscopic surgical trainer are identified.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article reports on the development and evaluation of a virtual reality training system (VRTS) for a specific machining task. A cognitive task analysis of expert machinists was conducted to examine whether this can be effective in developing a VRTS concerning tool length offsetting for a machining center. This analysis provided the necessary information for development and calibration of such a system. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the VRTS was evaluated by conducting an experiment with 29 mechanical engineering students. The VRTS set-up comprised a video projection of the machining center and a physical mock-up of its interface. The system demonstrated positive training transfer for the toll length offsetting task in terms of task accomplishment and of time to complete the task. No positive transfer was observed in terms of task accuracy, probably due to perceptual biases induced by the detailed specification of the VRTS. The present work provides evidence that cognitive task analysis was effective in identifying a number of key skills pertaining to the tool length offsetting task and in implementing ways to facilitate training in such tasks in a virtual environment. This article also demonstrates that even for tasks that include subtle perceptual skills VRTS may be beneficial regardless of the level of physical fidelity, provided that the cognitive organization of a task is adequately mapped in the system.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Human locomotor adaptation requires feedback and feed-forward control processes to maintain an appropriate walking pattern. Adaptation may require the use of visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory environment and back, as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight, the prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our previous paper, we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however, larger overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects, in the absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback, are believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because, in the absence of relevant external dynamic cues such as optic flow, reliance on body-based cues is enhanced during gait tasks through multisensory integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of optic flow on tactile-stimulated split-belt adaptation as a paradigm to facilitate the sensorimotor adaptation process. Twenty healthy young adults, separated into two matched groups, participated in the study. All participants performed an overground walking trial followed by a split-belt treadmill adaptation protocol. The tactile group (TC) received vibratory plantar tactile stimulation only, whereas the virtual reality and tactile group (VRT) received an additional concurrent visual stimulation: a moving virtual corridor, inducing perceived self-motion. A post-treadmill overground trial was performed to determine adaptation transfer. Interlimb coordination of spatiotemporal and kinetic variables was quantified using symmetry indices and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Marked changes of step length characteristics were observed in both groups during split-belt adaptation. Stance and swing time symmetries were similar in the two groups, suggesting that temporal parameters are not modified by optic flow. However, whereas the TC group displayed significant stance time asymmetries during the post-treadmill session, such aftereffects were absent in the VRT group. The results indicated that the enhanced transfer resulting from exposure to plantar cutaneous vibration during adaptation was alleviated by optic flow information. The presence of visual self-motion information may have reduced proprioceptive gain during learning. Thus, during overground walking, the learned proprioceptive split-belt pattern is more rapidly overridden by visual input due to its increased relative gain. The results suggest that when visual stimulation is provided during adaptive training, the system acquires the novel movement dynamics while maintaining the ability to flexibly adapt to different environments.

Edited Book",Chapter,"Increasingly, simulation-based training (SBT) is being recognized as a highly effective approach to training, particularly when targeting complex knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). Because it enables trainees to obtain experience enacting target KSAs within a safe environment that mirrors the characteristics of the real environment it serves as a unique mechanism for facilitating learning, administering feedback, and promoting the transfer of training. Though it is often associated with advanced technology and highly immersive equipment, SBT can come in a variety of forms. Indeed, organizations may shy away from SBT due to the potential costs involved, or in contrast, may overuse it, assuming that the use of cutting edge technology will guarantee effectiveness - in both cases, they would be selling themselves short. Simulations can vary in their degree and type of fidelity, each characteristic proving more or less effective in different contexts. Additionally, the use of simulation alone, regardless of its fidelity, does not guarantee that training will be effective. To work, the design and implementation of SBT must be grounded in the science of training such that it uses systematic procedures and incorporates specific instructional features. The purpose of this chapter is thus to provide an overview of SBT, including a description of what it entails, and what makes it effective. Additionally, we highlight a specific type of SBT-game-based training. This approach is gaining popularity in both research and practice, and may be particularly useful for promoting continuous learning, thus warranting additional discussion.

Typical measures of student success in WCNR (and higher education in general) have included student outcomes such as: retention, engagement, learning, and enhancing the overall student experience. However, little is known to what extent social factors such as sense of community have value in influencing student outcomes such as retention, learning, and students' overall experience. Therefore, the overall purpose of this dissertation was to examine the value of community in influencing student outcomes. This dissertation studied the role of community in influencing student outcomes in two types of academic programs (learning communities & fieldwork courses) and examined how students' level of social engagement within the WCNR community was related to their overall experience within the college. Chapter one outlines theories of student retention, experiential learning, and student engagement. Chapters two and three examined academic programs that have been shown to promote a sense of community: a residential first year learning community (chapter two) and fieldwork course (chapter three). In chapter four, the investigation of community was expanded beyond single programs and explored the extent to which students' social experience and participation in the WCNR community is related to their satisfaction with their overall experience within the college. Chapter five provides summaries of these studies and implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research. The first study examined sense of community in residential learning communities. Learning communities have been shown to effectively retain students and promote a sense of community, but it is unclear to what extent learning communities' effectiveness in retaining students can be attributed to sense of community. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to determine the value of the sense of community created by learning communities in influencing student persistence. The results of this study indicated that learning communities were effective in promoting a sense of community and students were generally not planning to leave the institution because their sense of community needs were not met. The second study examined the value of experiential learning in a fieldwork course at Pingree Park. Prior work has shown that fieldwork courses are effective in producing knowledge and skills that are transferable beyond the course, and a sense of community, but it is unclear to what extent the effectiveness of fieldwork courses in producing these outcomes can be attributed to a sense of community. The findings of this study indicated that sense of community had value in influencing knowledge and subsequently confidence in knowledge and skills gained in a residentially based field course. Additionally, sense of community had a significantly weaker effect on these outcomes, likely due to the less immersive social interactions with peers and the quality of sense of community they experienced compared to residential field course participants. The third and final study explored social engagement in the WCNR and the value of social engagement in influences student satisfaction. Social engagement was reflective of students' perceptions and level of participation of social components of the WCNR community. The findings of this study indicated that the more socially engaged a student is, the more satisfied they were with their WCNR experience. Additionally, active and collaborative learning, which is incorporated in many WCNR programs, was shown to positively influence social engagement. These findings suggest that the programs designed which incorporate active and collaborative le...

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Today, the workflows that are involved in industrial assembly and production activities are becoming increasingly complex. To efficiently and safely perform these workflows is demanding on the workers, in particular when it comes to infrequent or repetitive tasks. This burden on the workers can be eased by introducing smart assistance systems. This article presents a scalable concept and an integrated system demonstrator designed for this purpose. The basic idea is to learn workflows from observing multiple expert operators and then transfer the learnt workflow models to novice users. Being entirely learning-based, the proposed system can be applied to various tasks and domains. The above idea has been realized in a prototype, which combines components pushing the state of the art of hardware and software designed with interoperability in mind. The emphasis of this article is on the algorithms developed for the prototype: 1) fusion of inertial and visual sensor information from an on-body sensor network (BSN) to robustly track the user's pose in magnetically polluted environments; 2) learning-based computer vision algorithms to map the workspace, localize the sensor with respect to the workspace and capture objects, even as they are carried; 3) domain-independent and robust workflow recovery and monitoring algorithms based on spatiotemporal pairwise relations deduced from object and user movement with respect to the scene; and 4) context-sensitive augmented reality (AR) user feedback using a head-mounted display (HMD). A distinguishing key feature of the developed algorithms is that they all operate solely on data from the on-body sensor network and that no external instrumentation is needed. The feasibility of the chosen approach for the complete actionperception- feedback loop is demonstrated on three increasingly complex datasets representing manual industrial tasks. These limited size datasets indicate and highlight the potential of the chosen technology as a combined entity as well as point out limitations of the system.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We propose a new action-transferred design approach by which the benefits of embodied cognition and activity can be realized to enhance spatial learning and usability for navigating virtual spaces. The action-transferred design approach is supported by theories of learning, action-perception, and neuropsychology. These theories help us understand how human action can be transferred to different body parts for improving the usability of interaction techniques and why the acquired spatial knowledge using the transferred action may remain the same independent of the used body parts. The finger-walking-in-place (FWIP) navigation technique is used as a design example to demonstrate the concept of the action-transferred design approach. Leveraging 3D immersive virtual reality technology, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the performance of the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique in terms of spatial knowledge acquisition. The FWIP navigation technique was compared with a full-body-based walking-like (sensor-fusion walking-in-place; SF-WIP) navigation technique and a well-known, convenient (Joystick) navigation technique using a common input device, that is, a wand with a joystick. Both the action-transferred and the full-body-based navigation techniques were more effective for spatial learning than the navigation technique using the common input device. However, only the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique can provide users with the convenience of navigating with their fingers. These results suggest that the action-transferred design approach is useful in designing a navigation technique supporting users' spatial learning performance more effectively and conveniently. Possible design implications for broader applications are discussed and indicate that the action-transferred design approach is worth further study.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study evaluated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, developed within the scope of the SKILLS Integrated Project, for industrial maintenance and assembly (IMA) tasks training. VR and AR systems are now widely regarded as promising training platforms for complex and highly demanding IMA tasks. However, there is a need to empirically evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional training methods. Forty expert technicians were randomly assigned to four training groups in an electronic actuator assembly task: VR (training with the VR platform twice), Control-VR (watching a filmed demonstration twice), AR (training with the AR platform once), and Control-AR (training with the real actuator and the aid of a filmed demonstration once). A post-training test evaluated performance in the real task. Results demonstrate that, in general, the VR and AR training groups required longer training time compared to the Control-VR and Control-AR groups, respectively. There were fewer unsolved errors in the AR group compared to the Control-AR group, and no significant differences in final performance between the VR and Control-VR groups, probably due to a ceiling effect created by the use of two training trials in the selected task for participants who were expert technicians. The results suggest that use of the AR platform for training IMA tasks should be encouraged and use of the VR platform for that purpose should be further evaluated.

Cognitive load (Sweller, 1988) and wayfinding (Lynch, 1960) are discussed as potential theories underlying the challenges new virtual reality users face, and a tutorial is designed employing the theories of advance organizers (Ausbel, 1960), discovery learning (Bruner, 1961), and chunking (Miller, 1956; Anderson, 1977) alongside Gagne's (1965) nine events of instruction to supplant (Ausburn & Ausburn, 2003; Solomon, 1970) those challenges. The researcher-developed tutorial is quasi-experimentally evaluated and qualitatively assessed by the study participants to inform the development of an introductory checklist for designing VR training tutorials. The researcher found that the experimental tutorial helped participants navigate within virtual reality environments, promoted the transfer of training with curricular materials, helped users develop a sense of presence in the virtual environment, and supported a reduction of the subjects' perceived cognitive load. However, expected gender differences were not evident in the data, and while users' perceived cognitive load was reduced by using the tutorial, there was no significant effect on their learning performance, suggesting that other factors may influence performance in virtual environments. Also, instructional design flaws of the screen-based tutorial were discussed, and the VR tutorial design checklist was outlined.

The very nature of low-volume, high-risk, and problem-prone medical emergencies is that they occur with such infrequency it is difficult for staff to maintain competency and relevant knowledge and skills. Virtual reality (VR) has been proven an invaluable tool in the aviation, engineering, and military fields. Virtual worlds have been shown to be highly immersive and engaging. The ability to create sufficient detail to artifacts with which the physician and clinician will interact provides similar affordances as would their counterparts in reality. This close approximation through visual representations, spatial relationship that objects share with each other and with the avatar, and overall context created by the VR provide strong support for the transfer of learning from the VR to clinical setting. This study examined the development process for VR medical simulations that presented office-based emergencies, necessitated team interactions, and provided opportunities for participants to use countermeasures using a design-based research methodology. The VR environment provided a substantial overlap between the learning context, the participant's historical knowledge, and their performance at the point-of-care. Using a design-based research approach was very effective means of working with experimental design principles derived from literature and prototype projects. This research examined the optimal design needed to facilitate situation awareness, effective communications, and clinical decision-making in emergent situations and provides practical insights into the design of 3D virtual reality based medical simulations to create an optimal experience for learners.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Does the learning of a balance and stability skill exhibit time-course phases and transfer limitations characteristic of the acquisition and consolidation of voluntary movement sequences? Here we followed the performance of young adults trained in maintaining balance while standing on a moving platform synchronized with a virtual reality road travel scene. The training protocol included eight 3 min long iterations of the road scene. Center of Pressure (CoP) displacements were analyzed for each task iteration within the training session, as well as during tests at 24h, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-training to test for consolidation phase (""offline"") gains and assess retention. In addition, CoP displacements in reaction to external perturbations were assessed before and after the training session and in the 3 subsequent post-training assessments (stability tests). There were significant reductions in CoP displacements as experience accumulated within session, with performance stabilizing by the end of the session. However, CoP displacements were further reduced at 24h post-training (delayed ""offline"" gains) and these gains were robustly retained. There was no transfer of the practice-related gains to performance in the stability tests. The time-course of learning the balance maintenance task, as well as the limitation on generalizing the gains to untrained conditions, are in line with the results of studies of manual movement skill learning. The current results support the conjecture that a similar repertoire of basic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity may underlay skill (procedural, ""how to"" knowledge) acquisition and skill memory consolidation in voluntary and balance maintenance tasks.

Edited Book",Chapter,"Virtual reality (VR) literature includes many descriptions of users reacting to a virtual environment (VE) in instinctual ways that suggest they believe, at least for a short time, that they were ""immersed"" and even ""present"" in the synthetic experience. Following the definitions introduced by Slater et al. ""Presence is a state of consciousness, a state of being [in an environment]...while immersion is related to the quantity and quality of sensory data that is from that environment"". Specifically, immersion is generally understood to be a product of technology that facilitates the production of the multimodal sensory ""input"" to the user while presence is defined as the psychological perception of being ""there,"" within a VE. However, as commented by Biocca, and agreed by most researchers in the area, ""while the design of virtual reality technology has brought the theoretical issue of presence to the fore, few theorists argue that the experience of presence suddenly emerged with the arrival of virtual reality"". So, what is presence? And what is its possible impact in virtual exposure therapy? For instance, does a strong sense of presence cause patients to better engage and modify emotions and cognitive processes they have already developed in a real environment? Will the skills and the competences acquired in the virtual world transfer to a corresponding real experience? This chapter will try to provide some answers to these questions.

The results of the training of diagnostic skills can also be generalized to any other situation in which effective communication skills play a major role. Our aim with this study has been to develop a procedure of formative assessment in order to increment the effectiveness of virtual learning simulation systems and then to assess their efficacy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background. It has been suggested in the literature that virtual worlds can be an environment in which informal learning by participants can succeed through communication and collaboration, and that it would be valuable to investigate the extent to which the processes and principles underpinning this informal learning can be transferred to a formal learning context. The literature shows, however, a wide evidence gap. Aim. This article reports on the initial findings from empirical research currently in progress using a specific immersive online 3D environment, UNITE, to enhance collaboration and communication among tertiary students and which is guided by constructivist learning principles. Method. UNITE was constructed using Open Wonderland, an open source toolkit for creating 3D virtual worlds. Within the context of a particular set of constructivist principles, discussed in this article, which guided the development of UNITE, a more active approach to learning was adopted by the students, as compared with more passive traditional teaching methods. Following their use of UNITE, focus group discussion with participants was analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) framework. Results. Thematic analysis using IPA resulted in the identification of 11 themes: Technical Limitations and Problems, Importance of Avatar Representation, Use of Virtual Worlds in Formal Education, Communication and Collaboration, Building Confidence, Importance of Voice Communication, Participant Interest, Previous Exposure to Virtual Worlds, Participant Apprehension, Desired Improvements, and Absence of Non-Verbal Communication. All participants regarded their experience of using UNITE as a positive one. Focus group participants expressed a unanimous view that the use of virtual worlds within tertiary education is of educational benefit and should be more widely used to complement traditional teaching methods. Conclusion. In using UNITE, students were cognitively engaged, learning was hands-on, and the social component of learners interacting and supporting each other was emphasized in undertaking the learning activities. Results from this pilot study have provided an interesting insight into the potential of using 3D learning spaces for enhancing communication, collaboration, and teamwork. A more substantial and detailed implementation is now being planned across the tertiary education sector. This will involve students from a number of institutions, educational levels, and cognate areas.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Monitoring mental load for optimal performance has become increasingly central with the recently evolving need to cope with exponentially increasing amounts of data. This paper describes a non-intrusive, objective method to estimate mental workload in an immersive virtual reality system, through analysis of frequencies of pupil fluctuations. We tested changes in mental workload with a number of task-repetitions, level of predictability of the task and the effect of prior experience in predictable task performance, on mental workload of unpredictable task performance. Two measures were used to calculate mental workload: the ratio of Low Frequency to High Frequency components of pupil fluctuations, and the High Frequency alone, all extracted from the Power Spectrum Density of pupil fluctuations. Results show that mental workload decreases with a number of repetitions, creating a mode in which the brain acts as an automatic controller. Automaticity during training occurs only after a minimal number of repetitions, which once achieved, resulted in further improvements in the performance of unpredictable motor tasks, following training in a predictable task. These results indicate that automaticity is a central component in the transfer of skills from highly predictable to low predictable motor tasks. Our results suggest a potentially applicable method to brain-computer-interface systems that adapt to human mental workload, and provide intelligent automated support for enhanced performance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Acquired equivalence was investigated using a virtual reality conditioned suppression task administered in a first-person-shooter game. Two visual cues, A1 and B1, were followed by a tone (O1), and another two cues, A2 and B2, were followed by another tone (O2). During differential Pavlovian conditioning, A1 was paired with an instructed unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a flashing white screen, whereas A2 was not. All cues and outcomes were then presented at test, in the absence of the US, and suppression ratios were calculated for multiple response topographies (shots, hits, and breaks). Clear evidence of the suppression of shots was seen for A1 and B1, with no suppression being seen for either A2 or B2. Presentations of O1 and O2 resulted in significant suppression of shots and hits, whereas only O1 led to the suppression of breaks. The US expectancy ratings were consistent with these behavioral results. The findings are discussed in the light of differing accounts of acquired equivalence.

As the health care profession has move towards team-based practice, students and trainees need to practice team-based procedures that involve timely management of clinical tasks and adequate communication with other members of the team. Such team-based procedures include surgical and clinical procedures, some of which are protocol-driven. Cost and time required for individual team-based training sessions, along with other factors, contribute to making the training complex and challenging. A great deal of research has been done on medically-focused collaborative virtual reality (VR)-based training for protocol-driven procedures as a cost-effective as well as time-efficient solution. Most VR-based simulators focus on training of individual personnel. The ones which focus on providing team training provide an interactive simulation for only a few scenarios in a collaborative virtual environment (CVE). These simulators are suited for didactic training for cognitive skills development. The training sessions in the simulators require the physical presence of mentors. The problem with this kind of system is that the mentor must be present at the training location (either physically or virtually) to evaluate the performance of the team (or an individual). Another issue is that there is no efficient methodology that exists to provide feedback to the trainees during the training session itself (formative feedback). Furthermore, they lack the ability to provide training in acquisition or improvement of psychomotor skills for the tasks that require force or touch feedback such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). To find a potential solution to overcome some of these concerns, a novel training system was designed and developed that utilizes the integration of sensors into a CVE for time-critical medical procedures. The system allows the participants to simultaneously access the CVE and receive training from geographically diverse locations. The system is also able to provide real-time feedback and is also able to store important data during each training/testing session. Finally, this study also presents a generalizable collaborative team-training system that can be used across various team-based procedures in medical as well as non-medical domains.

How the central nervous system builds and maintains internal representations of such skilled hand-object interactions has attracted significant attention over the past three decades. Nevertheless, two major gaps exist: a) how digit positions and forces are coordinated during natural manipulation tasks, and b) what mechanisms underlie the formation and retention of internal representations of dexterous manipulation. This dissertation addresses these two questions through five experiments that are based on novel grip devices and experimental protocols. It was found that high-level representation of manipulation tasks can be learned in an effector-independent fashion. Specifically, when challenged by trial-to-trial variability in finger positions or using digits that were not previously engaged in learning the task, subjects could adjust finger forces to compensate for this variability, thus leading to consistent task performance. The results from a follow-up experiment conducted in a virtual reality environment indicate that haptic feedback is sufficient to implement the above coordination between digit position and forces. However, it was also found that the generalizability of a learned manipulation is limited across tasks. Specifically, when subjects learned to manipulate the same object across different contexts that require different motor output, interference was found at the time of switching contexts. Data from additional studies provide evidence for parallel learning processes, which are characterized by different rates of decay and learning. These experiments have provided important insight into the neural mechanisms underlying learning and control of object manipulation. The present findings have potential biomedical applications including brain-machine interfaces, rehabilitation of hand function, and prosthetics.

However, several researchers argue that little is known about the cognitive value of graphical representations, be they schematic visualizations, such as diagrams or more realistic, such as virtual reality. The study reported in the paper investigated whether the type of visualization (schematic versus realistic) has an effect on undergraduate students' learning of surveying practices (specifically, 'chaining'). The study compared two interactive virtual learning environments, one containing realistic visualizations of terrains and instruments, and one containing schematic graphical representations. Results of an experiment with 62 students show that there were not significant differences in learning between students who were exposed and interacted with the realistic visualizations versus those who interacted with the schematic ones.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual reality opens new opportunities for operator training in complex tasks. It lowers costs and has fewer constraints than traditional training. The ultimate goal of virtual training is to transfer knowledge gained in a virtual environment to an actual real-world setting. This study tested whether a maintenance procedure could be learnt equally well by virtual-environment and conventional training. Forty-two adults were divided into three equally sized groups: virtual training (GVT [generic virtual training]), conventional training (using a real tank suspension and preparation station) and control (no training). Participants then performed the procedure individually in the real environment. Both training types (conventional and virtual) produced similar levels of performance when the procedure was carried out in real conditions. Performance level for the two trained groups was better in terms of success and time taken to complete the task, time spent consulting job instructions and number of times the instructor provided guidance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Approaches for construction equipment operator training include several Virtual Reality-based simulators that are being promoted by construction equipment manufacturers. Systems range in their fidelity to real-world conditions, with a trainee seated in front of a monitor displaying a 3D-modelled training scenario, variously incorporating mock-ups of the operator controls, seat, and cabin; equipment noise and motion. The motivation for such training platforms is the ability to simulate innumerable conditions while avoiding potentially hazardous and expensive field training. The complexity represented by numerous machine types and functions, control mechanisms and configurations and operating environment conditions creates challenges for measuring skill development on the simulator and transfer of skill from the simulator to real-world operations. We discuss these challenges and present our current thinking as informed by relevant literature review and insights gained from a study of skill development and transfer using an operator training simulator for a hydraulic excavator.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: Behavioral achievements are the product of brain maturation. During postnatal development, the medial temporal lobe completes its maturation, and children acquire new memory abilities. In recent years, virtual reality-based tasks have been introduced in the neuropsychology field to assess different cognitive functions. In this work, desktop virtual reality tasks are combined with classic psychometric tests to assess spatial abilities in 4- to 10-year-old children. Method: Fifty boys and 50 girls 4-10-years of age participated in this study. Spatial reference memory and spatial working memory were assessed using a desktop virtual reality-based task. Other classic psychometric tests were also included in this work (e.g., the Corsi Block Tapping Test, digit tests, 10/36 Spatial Recall Test). Results: In general terms, 4- and 5-year-old groups showed poorer performance than the older groups. However, 5-year-old children showed basic spatial navigation abilities with little difficulty. In addition, boys outperformed girls from the 6-8-year-old groups. Gender differences only emerged in the reference-memory version of the spatial task, whereas both sexes displayed similar performances in the working-memory version. Conclusion: There was general improvement in the performance of different tasks in children older than 5 years. However, results also suggest that brain regions involved in allocentric memory are functional even at the age of 5. In addition, the brain structures underlying reference memory mature later in girls than those required for the working memory.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"While the ultimate goal of simulation training is to enhance learning, cost-effectiveness is a critical factor. Research that compares simulation training in terms of educational- and cost-effectiveness will lead to better-informed curricular decisions. Using previously published data we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of three simulation-based programs. Medical students (n = 15 per group) practiced in one of three 2-h intravenous catheterization skills training programs: low-fidelity (virtual reality), high-fidelity (mannequin), or progressive (consisting of virtual reality, task trainer, and mannequin simulator). One week later, all performed a transfer test on a hybrid simulation (standardized patient with a task trainer). We used a net benefit regression model to identify the most cost-effective training program via paired comparisons. We also created a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to visually represent the probability that one program is more cost-effective when compared to its comparator at various 'willingness-to-pay' values. We conducted separate analyses for implementation and total costs. The results showed that the progressive program had the highest total cost (p < 0.001) whereas the high-fidelity program had the highest implementation cost (p < 0.001). While the most cost-effective program depended on the decision makers' willingness-to-pay value, the progressive training program was generally most educationally- and cost-effective. Our analyses suggest that a progressive program that strategically combines simulation modalities provides a cost-effective solution. More generally, we have introduced how a cost-effectiveness analysis may be applied to simulation training; a method that medical educators may use to investment decisions (e.g., purchasing cost-effective and educationally sound simulators).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In an effort to improve training efficiency, the military has focused much attention on the development of replicable and generalizable training systems. As a result, a substantial number of companies and contractors have spent significant time and money developing a wide-array of simulators, virtual reality programs, and the like. However, many are designed without considering the effectiveness and efficiency of embedded instructional strategies. In response, the current review argues for the creation of improved training systems through the incorporation of a repository of research-based instructional strategies that can be employed across the entire training cycle. Using a grounded theory method, this review consolidates the vast literature on instructional strategies from the fields of education and the cognitive sciences into a coherent framework that can be used to enhance the design of military training systems. In particular, this review is intended to provide a concise, organized, and practical framework for the selection and implementation of research-based instructional strategies relevant to military training goals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"How do young people experience camp, and how might that experience help us expand our understanding of what is possible in non-formal learning environments? In-depth interviews consisting of forced-choice and open-ended questions were conducted with 59 Concordia Language Villages residential camp participants who partake in a linguistically and culturally enriched grand simulation. This study focused on (1) quantitative assessments of their sense of safety and belonging, and (2) open-ended questions about the nature of the camp environment in general and as a learning place. From the qualitative data, we distilled participants' sense of camp as a learning place by analysing their responses in terms of theoretically-driven categories of thinking space qualities and data-driven categories of experience space qualities. As a thinking space, participants described the camp environment as a safe space characterized by support for thinking and development, room for identity-supportive interactions, room to experiment, and a place with mentoring adults and a second-home feeling. As an experience space, they emphasized the centrality of the program's daily activities (particularly simulations), the qualities of the people around them (diverse and community-focused), the physical setting of the program (particularly its aesthetics) and the instructional methods used (particularly language and cultural immersion). The relationship of these findings to our understanding of the nature of the thinking and experience spaces as program-specific and program-general phenomena is discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Mental practice refers to the cognitive rehearsal of a physical activity. It is widely used by athletes to enhance their performance and its efficiency to help train motor function in people with physical disabilities is now recognized. Mental practice is generally based on motor imagery (MI), i.e., the conscious simulation of a movement without its actual execution. It may also be based on verbal rehearsal (VR), i.e., the silent rehearsal of the labels associated with an action. In this study, the effect of MI training or VR on the learning and retention of a foot-sequence task was investigated. Thirty right-footed subjects, aged between 22 and 37 years old (mean: 27.4 +/- 4.1 years) and randomly assigned to one of three groups, practiced a serial reaction time task involving a sequence of three dorsiflexions and three plantar flexions with the left foot. One group (n = 10) mentally practiced the sequence with MI for 5 weeks, another group (n = 10) mentally practiced the sequence with VR of the foot positions for the same duration, and a control group (n = 10) did not practice the sequence mentally. The time to perform the practiced sequence as well as an unpracticed sequence was recorded before training, immediately after training and 6 months after training (retention). The main results showed that the speed improvement after training was significantly greater in the MI group compared to the control group and tended to be greater in the VR group compared to the control group. The improvement in performance did not differ in the MI and VR groups. At retention, however, no difference in response times was found among the three groups, indicating that the effect of mental practice did not last over a long period without training. Interestingly, this pattern of results was similar for the practiced and non-practiced sequence. Overall, these results suggest that both MI training and VR help to improve motor performance and that mental practice may induce non-specific effects.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Of the available training methods for emergency responders, including other methods based on computer technology, virtual reality video game training with haptics (tactile) features will be shown to provide the most effective transfer of skills to real-world emergency situations, providing a model for the development of new training products for combat medics and civilian first responders. This paper aims to provide a methodological case study of haptics use in medical training programs and highlight achievements in terms of performance. Review of these cases show that the addition of haptics to an existing simulation-based training program increases user performance in terms of completion time, error rates, and learning rate. With this case study, haptics can be further incorporated into training programs designed for military combat medics.

The panel was asked to contribute ideas about the criteria that instructional designers expect to use when determining the selection of social software in the immersive world of Second Life, the steps that are essential for instructional designers when integrating social software into the immersive world of Second Life, and what social software is commonly being used in Second Life learning environments. The experts reached consensus about which instructional design models and process were best suited for including social software in an immersive learning environment. General consensus was found in four areas of the study: (a) the instructional design process impacts quality of instruction, (b) the perceived amount of time to employ an instructional design process can determine whether or not it should be included or excluded, (c) a model or set of procedures for integrating social software into immersive learning environment is needed, and (d) the inclusion of social software creates a more learner-focused, collaborative environment. These areas of consensus provide insight for instructional designers who design for immersive learning environments.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This research evaluated the training effectiveness of a novel simulation interface, a wearable computer integrated into a soldier's load-bearing equipment. Background: Military teams often use game-based simulators on desktop computers to train squad-level procedures. A wearable computer interface that mimics the soldier's equipment was expected to provide better training through increased realism and immersion. Method: A heuristic usability evaluation and two experiments were conducted. Eight evaluators interacted with both wearable and desktop interfaces and completed a usability survey. The first experiment compared the training retention of the wearable interface with a desktop simulator and interactive training video. The second experiment compared the training transfer of the wearable and desktop simulators with a live training environment. Results: Results indicated the wearable interface was more difficult to use and elicited stronger symptoms of simulator sickness. There was no significant difference in training retention between the wearable, desktop, or interactive video training methods. The live training used in the second experiment provided superior training transfer than the simulator conditions, with no difference between the desktop and wearable. Conclusion: The wearable simulator interface did not provide better training than the desktop computer interface. It also had poorer usability and caused worse simulator sickness. Therefore, it was a less effective training tool. Application: This research illustrates the importance of conducting empirical evaluations of novel training technologies. New and innovative technologies are always coveted by users, but new does not always guarantee improvement.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Studies of motor generalization usually perturb hand reaches by distorting visual feedback with virtual reality or by applying forces with a robotic manipulandum. Whereas such perturbations are useful for studying how the central nervous system adapts and generalizes to novel dynamics, they are rarely encountered in daily life. The most common perturbations that we experience are changes in the weights of objects that we hold. Here, we use a center-out, free-reaching task, in which we can manipulate the weight of a participant's hand to examine adaptation and generalization following naturalistic perturbations. In both trial-by-trial paradigms and block-based paradigms, we find that learning converges rapidly (on a timescale of approximately two trials), and this learning generalizes mostly to movements in nearby directions with a unimodal pattern. However, contrary to studies using more artificial perturbations, we find that the generalization has a strong global component. Furthermore, the generalization is enhanced with repeated exposure of the same perturbation. These results suggest that the familiarity of a perturbation is a major factor in movement generalization and that several theories of the neural control of movement, based on perturbations applied by robots or in virtual reality, may need to be extended by incorporating prior influence that is characterized by the familiarity of the perturbation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"This editorial discusses how lectures can stand up against interactive learning environments. By and large teachers know how to motivate students by lecturing and interacting with them by standing in front of them in a classroom. How can a teacher compete with words and gestures against the dramatic power of carefully crafted interactive computer learning environments is the main question. Surveys have a difficult time revealing the causal connections among all the many variables involved. The main questions are, are students' memory spans really decreasing, are their research skills improving or getting worse, is the internet proving to be a positive or negative effect on students' research skills and learning in general, what is the effect on students of expecting learning to be fun and immersive, can the hard fought skills of intellectual curiosity and academic rigor really be taught with online fun and games, can the motivation created by stimulating multimedia interactive environments endure to create lifelong learning;or is it an impediment to the effective use of the main instruments of education, the book, and chalk and talk lectures. Survey research can raise many questions but the answers must be found through carefully designed experimental research with control groups.

Edited Book",Chapter,"The central nervous system (CNS) integrates information from multiple sensory modalities, including visual and proprioceptive information, when planning a reaching movement (Jeannerod, 1988). Although visual and proprioceptive information regarding hand (or end point effector) position are not always consistent, performance is typically better under reaching conditions in which both sources of information are available. Under certain task conditions, visual signals tend to dominate such that one relies more on visual information than proprioception to guide movement. For example, individuals reaching to a target with misaligned visual feedback of the hand, as experienced when reaching in a virtual reality environment or while wearing prism displacement goggles, adjust their movements in order for the visual representation of the hand to achieve the desired end point even when their actual hand is elsewhere in the workspace (Krakauer et al, 1999, 2000; Redding and Wallace, 1996; Simani et al., 2007). This motor adaptation typically occurs rapidly, reaching baseline levels within twenty trials per target, and without participants' awareness (Krakauer et al., 2000). Furthermore, participants reach with these adapted movement patterns following removal of the distortion, and hence show aftereffects (Baraduc and Wolpert, 2002; Buch et al., 2003; Krakauer et al., 1999, 2000; Martin et al., 1996). These aftereffects provide a measure of motor learning referred to as visuomotor adaptation and result from the CNS learning a new visuomotor mapping to guide movement. In general, it is assumed that visuomotor adaptation relies mainly on error-based learning (Berniker and Kording, 2008; Shadmehr et al., 2010; Tseng et al., 2007; Wei and Kording, 2009). That is, the CNS compares the movement vector derived from one's actual performance (i.e., a vector from the start location to the end position achieved by the hand or end effector) with a target vector (i.e., a vector from the start location to the target location). The resulting difference vector, which is derived from the sensory feedback of the movement, is then used to compute a new motor plan with the goal of bringing the end effector to the target on the subsequent trial. Specifically, if the ""seen"" hand movement or visual representation of the hand does not achieve the target or differs from the predicted outcome, then the brain uses these errors to update sensorimotor mappings (i.e., adapt an internal model based on the differences between predicted and actual sensory feedback) (Miall and Wolpert, 1996; Wolpert et al., 1995). This error signal can be referred to as the sensorimotor error signal (Wong and Shelhamer, 2011) and is believed to result in implicit adaptation and movement aftereffects. In addition to movement aftereffects, it has been suggested that reaching with misaligned visual feedback of the hand results in sensory recalibration. In particular, in the case of visuomotor adaptation paradigms, proprioception is thought to be recalibrated or realigned to match the visual representation of the hand-an effect that we refer to as proprioceptive recalibration. Furthermore, it has been proposed that proprioceptive recalibration gives rise to motor adaptation (Craske and Gregg, 1966; Harris, 1963, 1965; Hay and Pick, 1966; Redding and Wallace, 1978, 1988, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006; Templeton et al., 1974). This chapter discusses motor adaptation and proprioceptive recalibration, including sensory recalibration with prism displacement and in virtual reality environments; recalibrating hand path and hand position; proprioceptive recalibration across the lifespan; and the relationship between recalibration and adaptation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Does the immersive design of an educational gaming environment affect learners' virtual presence and how much do they learn? Does virtual presence affect learning? This study tries to answer these questions by examining the differences in virtual presence and learning outcomes in two different computer- based multimedia environments: a gaming environment with high immersive design vs. hypertext learning environment with low immersive design. As the main focus, the effect of virtual presence on learning is also explained and tested. By identifying virtual presence as a variable that may determine learning, it is argued that computer gaming environments present a new challenge for researchers to investigate, particularly, the effects of virtual presence on the immersive design of games in order to help designers to predict which instructional configurations will maximize learning performance. In general, results revealed that the high-immersive gaming environment leads to the strongest form of virtual presence but also decreased learning. Although regression analyses indicate that virtual presence positively influences trivial- and non-trivial learning outcomes, learners who learned in a low-immersive environment outperformed the gaming group. A mediation analysis showed that the relation between virtual presence and non-trivial learning outcomes is partly mediated through increased cognitive load.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"One of the more debated issues regarding training simulators is their validity for transfer of skills to sensory environments that differ from the simulator. In two experiments, the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) and collocated (Col) visual displays were evaluated in a realistic and complex visuomotor task. The two factors were evaluated independently, comparing Col-2D with dislocated-2D (experiment 1) and with Col-3D (experiment 2). As expected, in both cases the more immersive presentation condition facilitated better performance. Furthermore, improvement following training in the more immersive condition carried over to the following less immersive condition but there was no carry over in the opposing order of presentation. This is taken as an indication for the differential development of skills conditioned by the level of immersiveness of the training environment. This further suggests that learning of complex realistic tasks is not carried over from less immersive simulator to the complex sensory environment of reality, due to the large gap in sensory patterns.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Although the value of serious games in education is undeniable and the potential benefits of using video games as ideal companions to classroom instruction is unquestionable, there is still little consensus on the game features supporting learning effectiveness, the process by which games engage learners, and the types of learning outcomes that can be achieved through game play. Our aim in this discussion is precisely to advance in this direction by providing evidence of some of the factors influencing the learning effectiveness of a serious game called It's a Deal! This serious game was created for the purpose of teaching intercultural business communication between Spaniards and Britons in business settings in which English is used as the lingua franca. This paper hypothesizes that the immersive, all-embracing and interactive learning environment provided by the video game to its users may contribute to develop and enhance their intercultural communicative competence. The study attempts to answer three main research questions: (a) after playing It's a Deal!, did the students sampled improve their intercultural awareness, intercultural knowledge and intercultural communicative competence in business English? (b) If they improved their intercultural learning, what are the factors influencing such improvement? And (c) if they did not improve their intercultural learning, what are the factors influencing such failure? The game participants who volunteered to take part in the study were all students of English Studies at the University of Alicante in the academic year 2010-2011. One hundred and six students completed both the pre-test and the post-test questionnaires, and played It's a Deal! A sample of fifty students was selected randomly for the empirical study. The results obtained in the tests performed were compared and contrasted intra-group, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the purpose of finding any statistically significant difference that may confirm whether or not there was an improvement in the students' intercultural communicative competence in business English as a result of the implementation of the It's a Deal! serious game. Findings of this study demonstrate that the video game is an effective learning tool for the teaching of intercultural communication between Spaniards and Britons in business settings in which English is used as the lingua franca. In particular, whereas the game had a small learning effect on intercultural awareness and a medium learning effect on intercultural knowledge, it had a large learning effect on intercultural communicative competence. The study also documents correlating factors that make serious games effective, since it shows that the learning effectiveness of It's a Deal! stems from the correct balance of the different dimensions involved in the creation of serious games, specifically instructional content, game dimensions, game cycle, debriefing, perceived educational value, transfer of learnt skills and intrinsic motivation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper puts forward a new design perspective for game-based learning. The general idea is to abandon the long sought-after dream of designing a closed learning system, where students in both primary and secondary school could learn-without the interference of teachers-whatever subject they wanted while sitting in front of a computer. This describes a caricature, I know, but it still lurks in the background whenever we speak of, read or write about learning with computer games. The entire field of learning with games is called 'serious games', since they find themselves on a direct collision course with off-the-shelf, commercial entertainment games. This paper promotes two different yet interconnected ideas. The first aims to describe a new design perspective for game-based learning, which in many ways not only will provoke the abovementioned latent dream of a closed game-based learning system, but will also confront aspects of modern learning theory, especially the notion of reference between the content of an assignment and the reality with which it should or could be connected (situated learning). The second idea promotes a way of tackling the common experience of the average learner from primary to secondary school. He or she is often unable to fully grasp, understand or comprehend the learning process in which he or she is embedded. Portfolios, and especially e-portfolios, can be used to encourage reflection on both the learner's development and the learning process in order to ground the student's reason to learn. This paper proposes a different approach: using visualisation in immersive 3D worlds as both documentation of learning progress and as a reward system which motivates further learning. The overall design idea is to build a game-based learning system from three or more different, yet interconnected, elements: namely a teacher, a web-based platform and an immersive game or play world.

To date, there is a paucity of research on effective treatment strategies for PM deficits. In the present study, an innovative PM treatment combining modern computer technologies with artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) was proposed. Combining the simulated training environment provided by VR and the individualized feedback provided by AI, an optimal training environment could thus be created for people with ABI. This ""intelligent virtual reality prospective memory"" (IVRPM) training programme could be a cost-effective means to offer PM training content which is considered ecologically valid for the living environment of people with ABI. In order to investigate the effectiveness of this novel IVRPM training programme, another non-AI version, a ""virtual reality prospective memory"" (VRPM) training programme was developed for comparison purposes. A single-blinded, pre-test/post-test randomized controlled trial was adopted. Fifty-six subjects were successfully recruited. They were randomly assigned to an IVRPM treatment group, a VRPM treatment group, or a control group. Subjects who were assigned to the two treatment groups were provided with ten sessions of training in the respective programmes. Subjects' PM performance, retrospective memory performance, frontal lobe functioning, level of community integration, and self efficacy were assessed before and after the training. The results showed that subjects in the IVRPM group performed significantly better in PM functioning, level of community integration and self-efficacy. It may suggest that the subjects in the IVRPM group not only learnt better, but also showed better transference of skills to the real environment. Finally, the findings showed that the AI system could help to establish subjects' self efficacy and hence it improved their perception of their level of community integration as compared with the control group. To conclude, the findings from the present study showed that the combination of AI and VR can be a feasible and successful treatment strategy for PM rehabilitation of people with ABI. Further application of the present training model to other groups of patients should be encouraged.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"How do we know where we are? Orientation in space is key to our daily existence as we follow familiar routes, navigate to a previous location, or just try to get home as quickly as possible. As well as being interesting in its own right, spatial cognition is also a useful model system in which to understand the neural bases of cognition and memory formation more generally. Spatial behavior offers potentially straightforward correlates of neuronal activity that can be studied similarly in adults and infants of both human and non-human animals. The neural mechanisms of spatial behavior can be realistically investigated in a well-controlled way with the aid of virtual reality technologies in humans and rodents. Virtual reality can thus help to bridge the gap between electrophysiological studies in rodents and brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans. Within this framework, this article aims to translate findings from the single cell level in rodents to understand the neural and systems level mechanisms of spatial cognition in the human brain.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"After extensive practice with motor tasks sharing structural similarities (e.g., different dancing movements, or different sword techniques), new tasks of the same type can be learned faster. According to the recent ""structure learning"" hypothesis (Braun et al., 2009a), such rapid generalization of related motor skills relies on learning the dynamic and kinematic relationships shared by this set of skills. As a consequence, motor adaptation becomes constrained, effectively leading to a dimensionality reduction of the learning problem; at the same time, adaptation to tasks lying outside the structure becomes biased toward the structure. We tested these predictions by investigating how previously learned structures influence subsequent motor adaptation. Human subjects were making reaching movements in 3D virtual reality, experiencing perturbations either in the vertical or in the horizontal plane. Perturbations were either visuomotor rotations of varying angle or velocity-dependent forces of varying strength. We found that, after extensive training with both kinematic or dynamic perturbations, adaptation to unpracticed, diagonal, perturbations happened along the previously learned structure (vertical or horizontal), and resulting adaptation trajectories were curved. This effect is robust, can be observed on the single-subject level, and occurs during adaptation both within and across trials. Additionally, we demonstrate that structure learning changes involuntary visuomotor reflexes and therefore is not exclusively a high-level cognitive phenomenon.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Virtual world technology is now being incorporated into various higher education programs, often with enthusiastic claims about the improvement of students' abilities to experience learning problems and tasks in computer-mediated virtual reality through the use of computer-generated personal agents or avatars. The interactivity of the avatars with each other is the central learning experience, but serious questions arise about the possible instability of the identity of the avatars and their dubious relations to the learners controlling them. Another problem is the questionable transference of experiential learning from the virtual world to the actual world. A final problem is the meaning of the possibility of avatars engaging in immoral activities. This paper reflects on these matters and attempts to relate the use of avatars to the five principal experiential learning paradigms: constructivism, psychoanalytic intervention, situative learning, critical emancipation, and complex co-emergence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"As commented by Biocca [1], and agreed by most researchers in the area, ""while the design of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has brought the theoretical issue of presence to the fore, few theorists argue that the experience of presence suddenly emerged with the arrival of VR"" (p. 121). So, what is presence? And what is its possible impact in cybertherapy? For instance, does a strong sense of presence cause patients to better engage and modify emotions and cognitive processes they have already developed in a real environment? Will the skills and the competences acquired in the virtual world transfer to a corresponding real experience? This chapter will try to provide some answers to these questions using the following definition of presence: presence is the non-mediated (prereflexive) perception of using the body/a medium to successfully transform intentions in action (enaction).

This mixed-methods exploratory study used orienting, navigating, and wayfinding theory, digital performance-recording technology, and expert judges to examine the influences of the individual characteristics of field dependent/field independent cognitive style, gender, and prior domain knowledge or experience on navigation behaviors and survey knowledge acquisition of 30 police officers in a virtual crime scene created for the study. Findings and Conclusions. Detailed analyses were made of navigational moves and post-VE-treatment drawings of the virtual crime scene. Based on descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, analysis of variance, qualitative data, inter-judge reliability coefficients, and rating scores on post-treatment drawings, several conclusions were drawn: (1) Navigational behaviors in a desktop VE is individualistic rather than occupational. (2) Identification of instructional design flaws in VEs is critical to successful navigation. (3) Tendency for disorientation in a VE is related to cognitive style. (4) Cognitive style differences are more influential on the learning process than on the learning outcome in a VE. (5) Prior domain knowledge and experience may affect learning in VEs less than in other media. (6) Computer gaming experience influences performance in VEs. (7) There are gender differences in navigational behaviors in VEs. (8) A sense of ""presence"" (""being there"") can be achieved in a desktop VE. (9) Real-world training can transfer to a desktop VE. (10) Pre-immersion training and preparation of learners are critical to successful navigation and learning in VEs. (11) Learners with different characteristics can learn from desktop VEs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This study developed and validated a virtual reality (VR) simulator for use by interventional radiologists. Background: Research in the area of skill acquisition reports practice as essential to become a task expert. Studies on simulation show skills learned in VR can be successfully transferred to a real-world task. Recently, with improvements in technology, VR simulators have been developed to allow complex medical procedures to be practiced without risking the patient. Method: Three studies are reported. In Study 1, 35 consultant interventional radiologists took part in a cognitive task analysis to empirically establish the key competencies of the Seldinger procedure. In Study 2, 62 participants performed one simulated procedure, and their performance was compared by expertise. In Study 3, the transferability of simulator training to a real-world procedure was assessed with 14 trainees. Results: Study 1 produced 23 key competencies that were implemented as performance measures in the simulator. Study 2 showed the simulator had both face and construct validity, although some issues were identified. Study 3 showed the group that had undergone simulator training received significantly higher mean performance ratings on a subsequent patient procedure. Conclusion: The findings of this study support the centrality of validation in the successful design of simulators and show the utility of simulators as a training device. Application: The studies show the key elements of a validation program for a simulator. In addition to task analysis and face and construct validities, the authors highlight the importance of transfer of training in validation studies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"An individual's prior experience will influence how new visual information in a scene is perceived and remembered. Accuracy of memory performance per se is an imperfect reflection of the cognitive activity (awareness states) that underlies performance in memory tasks. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of varied visual fidelity of training environments on the transfer of training to the real world after exposure to immersive simulations representing a real-world scene. A between groups experiment was carried out to explore the effect of rendering quality on measurements of location-based recognition memory for objects and associated states of awareness. The immersive simulation consisted of one room that was either rendered flat-shaded or using radiosity rendering. The simulation was displayed on a stereo head-tracked head mounted display. Post exposure to the synthetic simulation, participants completed a memory recognition task conducted in a real-world scene by physically arranging objects in their physical form in a real-world room. Participants also reported one of four states of awareness following object recognition. They were given several options of awareness states that reflected the level of visual mental imagery involved during retrieval, the familiarity of the recollection and related guesses. The scene incorporated objects that ""fitted"" into the specific context of the real-world scene, referred to as consistent objects, and objects that were not related to the specific context of the real-world scene, referred to as inconsistent objects. A follow-up study was conducted a week after the initial test. Interestingly, results revealed a higher proportion of correct object recognition associated with mental imagery when participants were exposed to low-fidelity flat-shaded training scenes rather than the radiosity rendered ones. Memory psychology indicates that awareness states based on visual imagery require stronger attentional processing in the first instance than those based on familiarity. A tentative claim would, therefore, be that those immersive environments that are distinctive because of their variation from ""real,"" such as flat-shaded environments, recruit stronger attentional resources. This additional attentional processing may bring about a change in participants' subjective experiences of ""remembering"" when they later transfer the training from that environment into a real-world situation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The idea of utilizing the rich potential of today's computer games for educational purposes excites educators, scientists and technicians. Despite the significant hype over digital game-based learning, the genre is currently at an early stage. One of the most significant challenges for research and development in this area is establishing intelligent mechanisms to support and guide the learner, and to realize a subtle balance between learning and gaming, and between challenge and ability on an individual basis. In contrast to traditional approaches of adaptive and intelligent tutoring, the key advantage of games is their immersive and motivational potential. Because of this, the psycho-pedagogical and didactic measures must not compromise gaming experience, immersion and flow. In the present paper, we introduce the concept of micro-adaptivity, an approach that enables an educational game to intelligently monitor and interpret the learner's behaviour in the game's virtual world in a non-invasive manner. On this basis, micro-adaptivity enables interventions, support, guidance or feedback in a meaningful, personalized way that is embedded in the game's flow.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Traditional approaches to learning have often focused upon knowledge transfer strategies that have centred on textually-based engagements with learners, and dialogic methods of interaction with tutors. The use of virtual worlds, with text-based, voice-based and a feeling of presence naturally is allowing for more complex social interactions and designed learning experiences and role plays, as well as encouraging learner empowerment through increased interactivity. To unpick these complex social interactions and more interactive designed experiences, this paper considers the use of virtual worlds in relation to structured learning activities for college and lifelong learners. This consideration necessarily has implications upon learning theories adopted and practices taken up, with real implications for tutors and learners alike. Alongside this is the notion of learning as an ongoing set of processes mediated via social interactions and experiential learning circumstances within designed virtual and hybrid spaces. This implies the need for new methodologies for evaluating the efficacy, benefits and challenges of learning in these new ways. Towards this aim, this paper proposes an evaluation methodology for supporting the development of specified learning activities in virtual worlds, based upon inductive methods and augmented by the four-dimensional framework reported in a previous study. The study undertaken aimed to test the efficacy of the proposed evaluation methodology and framework, and to evaluate the broader uses of a virtual world for supporting lifelong learners specifically in their educational choices and career decisions. The paper presents the findings of the study and considers that virtual worlds are reorganising significantly how we relate to the design and delivery of learning. This is opening up a transition in learning predicated upon the notion of learning design through the lens of immersive learning experiences rather than sets of knowledge to be transferred between tutor and learner. The challenges that remain for tutors rest with the design and delivery of these activities and experiences. The approach advocated here builds upon an incremental testing and evaluation of virtual world learning experiences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Massively multiplayer games (MMOs) are immersive virtual three-dimensional fantasy worlds in which people cooperate and compete with each other, as well as with the computer-generated denizens of that particular game world. Although typically seen as games, their strong social aspect suggests that they are a form of online communication tool, with which players interact to form friendships, create communities, and work together to accomplish a variety of goals. After an introduction to MMOs, this review explores how social aspects of the game imitate the real world in terms of choices that players make when interacting with others. Furthermore, player-to-player interactions are examined in terms of in-game group formation and how efficient communication is imperative for goal achievement. The review also explores how leadership skills learned in-game may be transferred to real-world scenarios. The reasons why people play MMOs are examined in terms of player motivations and how aspects of game play may have both positive and negative consequences for a player's well-being. The latter half of the review describes how MMOs are used as afterschool virtual teaching environments where students can use aspects of game play to learn, for example, leadership qualities. The review concludes with recommendations for using MMOs as virtual laboratories to explore aspects of human behavior.

R",,,,"Harrington, Maria C. R.: U Pittsburgh, US","Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences. Vol.70(12-A),2010, pp. 4497.",,,0419-4209,,Dissertation Abstracts International,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"While there are many studies on collaborative or guided scientific inquiry in real, virtual, and simulated environments, there are few that study the interplay between the design of the simulation and the user interface. The main research aim was to decompose the simulation and user interface into the design parameters that influence attention, curiosity, inquiry, and learning of scientific material and acts of creation for children. The research design investigates what tools support independent exploration of a space, enhance deep learning, and motivate scientific or creative inquiry. A major interest is in the role that ecological context plays in the perception of spatial information. None of the prior work on learning in virtual environments considered a child-centric computer interaction framing, independent of pedagogy and focused on the impact of user interface parameters, such as image quality and navigational freedom. A major contribution of this research is the construction of the Virtual Trillium Trail, as it represents one square mile of biologically accurate scientific plot study data. It is a virtual environment based on statistical data visualization, not fantasy. It allowed for a highly realistic simulation and scientifically true-to-life visualization, as well as for a planned orthogonal contrast with exceptionally high internal validity in both system and statistical research design. Of critical importance is evidence in the pilot study, that virtual reality field trips for students may be used to prime before and to reinforce after a real field trip. This research also showed transfer effects on in-situ learning activity, in both directions. Thus, supports the claim that virtual environments may augment educational practices, not replace them, to maximize the overall learning impact. The other large contribution was in the activity analysis of the real field trip, where the Salamander Effect is observed as an environmental event, which opened a Teachable Moment event for the teacher, and which was then translated into a system design feature, a Salient Event in the user interface. A main part of this research is the importance of such events, as ways to support intrinsic learning activity, and leverage episodic memory. The main empirical contribution to the design of educational virtual environments was produced by the 2x2 ANOVA with the factors of Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom, set to high and low levels, and the evidence of different effects on Knowledge Gained. The tool has an impact on intrinsic learning, which is measured here by a pre-test and a post-test on facts and concepts. A two-factor analysis of variance showed a significant effect of Visual Fidelity on Knowledge Gained, F(1,60) = 10.54, p = 0.0019. High Visual Fidelity condition has a greater impact on Knowledge Gained (M = 30.95, SD = 14.76), than Low Visual Fidelity condition (M = 19.99, SD = 13.39). Photorealistic versions had a stronger impact on learning than cartoon versions. There was significant interaction between Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom, F(1,60) = 4.85, p = 0.0315, with the largest impact in the combined conditions of High Visual Fidelity and High Navigational Freedom on Knowledge Gained (M = 37.44, SD = 13.88). Thus, photorealistic, free navigation virtual environments double learning, when compared to cartoon versions, ceteris paribus. The next major contribution to the design of the user interface in educational virtual environments is the design and use of Salient Events as components to augment the virtual environment and to facilitate intrinsic inquiry into facts and concepts. A two-factor analysis of variance showed a significant effect of Visual Fidelity on Salient Event counts, F(1,60) = 4.35, p = 0.00.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The aim of this study was to compare subjects' spatial performance on a pedestrian route depending on three factors: (1) the type of learning environment (real vs. virtual); (2) the exploration mode during the learning phase (active vs. passive); and (3) the type of spatial test administered at retrieval (i.e., wayfinding, sketch mapping, and picture ordering). Moreover, each subject was tested two times: 48hr and 7 days after the learning phase. First of all, regarding the whole data, the results presented in this paper indicate good spatial-knowledge transfer from Virtual Reality to the real world, irrespective to the retrieval tests administered to the subjects. Moreover, the exploration mode does not seem here to significantly influence the spatial performance. In contrast, the subjects' performance was greatly increased on the 7-day compared to the 48hr recall phase, and particularly, on the wayfinding test (i.e., on the most ecological test). In conclusion, the most influent factor on spatial-knowledge transfer from virtual to real environments seems not to be the active learning of the information, but the testing procedure. The results are discussed using the notions of training effect and transfer-appropriate processing. Although further investigations are needed, the results are already encouraging the development of virtual training or rehabilitation programs addressed to spatial cognitive processes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Aim: This paper details the experience of establishing an integrated skills training centre for use in undergraduate nursing education in The Open University of Hong Kong. Background: Skills training is an essential element in undergraduate nursing education. Owing to the increasing complexity of the health-care system and patient health needs, undergraduate nursing students should be well prepared for integrated skills competency, critical thinking and rapid decision-making. To achieve this goal, the use of simulation as a skills training tool is being recommended. Conclusion: The Clinical Nursing Education Centre is established. It adopts simulation as a teaching and learning tool. It has four specific education units, namely: (1) clinical simulation education unit, (2) virtual reality education unit, (3) nursing skills education unit, and (4) Chinese medicinal education unit. These units are specifically designed for the teaching and learning of nursing skills related to general, mental and Chinese medicinal nursing from elementary to advanced level. Experiences pertaining to the conceptualization, exploration and actualization phases of the establishment are presented. Details of the structure and specific functions of the centre are also illustrated. Finally, there is discussion on the challenges encountered during the establishment process and how they were overcome.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Through repeated practice under conditions similar to those in real-world settings, simulator training prepares an individual to maintain effective performance under stressful work conditions. Interfaces offering high fidelity and immersion can more closely reproduce real-world experiences and are generally believed to result in better learning outcomes. However, absolute fidelity in stress training is not critical for skills to be transferable. The present study compared the performance outcomes achieved by trainees using two different simulator types to complete a training program aimed at improving decision-making skills. The purpose of this research was to assess both the overall level of training effectiveness and to determine whether performance levels were influenced when high (160 degree curved wide screen) versus low fidelity (small cab-based flat screen) simulator types were in use. Sixty-three train drivers drove for 40 min on a simulated track on which they encountered four major high stress driving events. One year later, 42 of the original drivers returned and repeated the training scenario a second and third time. Results revealed trainees using the lower fidelity flat screen simulator made fewer errors in both years than trainees using the high fidelity curved screen simulator. The implications of these results are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Within the framework of cognitive rehabilitation using virtual reality (VR), one of the major challenges is to study beforehand the effectiveness of the virtual-real transfer of learning and to define cognitive aids. The aim of this experiment was to verify if, after learning spatial knowledge (i.e., a route) in VR, performances can be transferred to reality, then maintained in real time, and improved with the aid of an active navigation (i.e., using a joystick). Ninety student volunteers from the University of Bordeaux 2 (45 men and 45 women) participated in the experiment. The virtual environment (VE) used for learning was a replica of an area of Bordeaux. The factors tested were retention delay (Immediate vs. 48 hours) and type of navigation (Passive virtual vs. Active virtual vs. Real), using three recall tasks: wayfinding, freehand sketch and photograph classification. Our results showed that the virtual-real transfer was not degraded by a retention delay of 48 hours and that active navigation allowed performances to be optimized.

MILLEE improves literacy through language learning games on cellphones-the ""Personal Computers of the developing world""-which are a perfect vehicle for new kinds of out-of-school language learning. Games bring children into rich, immersive environments where they can acquire and use language naturally, while encouraging them to transfer their language skills outside the game. The MILLEE research project focuses on developing scalable, localizable design principles and tools for language learning. The challenges are (i) to integrate sound learning principles, (ii) to provide concrete design patterns that integrate entertainment and learning, and (iii) to account for cultural and learning differences in children in developing regions. In this thesis, we will describe a framework called PACE that addresses these challenges and eight rounds of fieldwork that had contributed to its development. We will also describe a tool to expedite audio-only learning (Pimsleur Generator), a very important niche for developing regions. We discuss our most recent work which patterns learning games after local children's traditional village games and the benefits this approach offers. Finally, we describe the complex adoption ecology in developing regions, and how MILLEE preserves learning principles while supporting rich localization and customization at multiple stages in the adoption hierarchy.

These skill deficits threaten their physical well-being and limit their personal independence. An effective intervention model for teaching safety skills is behavioral skills training (BST). The effects of this 4-part intervention, which includes Instructions, Modeling, Rehearsal, and Feedback, improve with the addition of in situ training. However, creating realistic, safe, and logistically feasible contexts for rehearsal of skills may prove difficult, if not impossible. Virtual reality (VR) may present a solution. Recent studies illustrate that children with ASDs can interact meaningfully within VR, which affords incomparable control for arrangement of environments that best promote learning and generalization. This study sought to evaluate the effects of a partially immersive VR enhanced BST intervention to teach 5 children with ASDs (ages 9-13) safe street-crossing skills. A non concurrent multiple baseline design across participants was used to control for historical and maturational confounds while replicating treatment effects across participants in the virtual environment, and a within subject repeated measures design was used to determine the effects of training on skills in the natural environment. Data indicate mastery of the skill set within the virtual environment for all participants. Additionally, performance improvements were observed from pre-test to post-test in the natural environment, with some participants demonstrating treatment gains following instructions and modeling.

However, there is little research into the simple equivalence of an individual's performance across real and virtual environments, an important topic which could support the use of virtual reality as an assessment and research tool. This pilot study compared route-learning performance in a desktop virtual town with performance around a real-world route. Participants were ""driven"" around a route through a virtual town and around a different (but equally complex) route through a real-world suburb, then asked to direct the driver back around each of the routes from memory. They completed strategy checklists after learning each route. Results indicated good equivalence between the real and virtual environments, with comparable error rates and no differences in strategy preferences. This demonstrates that simple desktop virtual environments may be a useful tool for assessment of and research into route learning.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Health professionals need to be able to communicate information about genomic susceptibility in understandable and usable ways, but substantial challenges are involved. We developed four learning modules that varied along two factors: (1) learning mode (active learning vs. didactic learning) and (2) metaphor (risk elevator vs. bridge) and tested them using a 2 x 2 between-subjects, repeated measures design. The study used an innovative virtual reality technology experimental platform; four virtual worlds were designed to convey the concept that genetic and behavioral factors interact to affect common disease risk. The primary outcome was comprehension (recall, transfer). Study participants were 42 undergraduates aged 19-23. The results indicated that the elevator metaphor better supported learning of the concept than the bridge metaphor. Mean transfer score was significantly higher for the elevator metaphor (p < 0.05). Mean change in recall was significantly higher for didactic learning than active learning (p < 0.05). Mean ratings for variables posited to be associated with better learning (e.g., motivation), however, were generally higher for the active learning worlds. The results suggested that active learning might not always be more effective than didactic learning in increasing comprehension of health information. The findings also indicated that less complex metaphors might convey abstract concepts more effectively.

The present research study explored how educational gaming environments can be designed to not only leverage narrative as a cognitive aid, but do so in a way that caters to both experienced and novice game-playing students. Using a 3 x 2 factorial design, the effects of Narrative (present vs. not present) were studied within the context of three different types of Game-Orientation Training (pre-game, in-game, or none)-each of which were designed to scaffold the player on how to move and interact in the environment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six treatments consisting of a 3-D educational video game that offered instruction on electrical devices and circuits. The effects of narrative and game-orientation training were evaluated in terms of in-game performance of educational tasks, the amount of instructional guidance sought, posttest performance in recalling and transferring learned content, narrative awareness, and player attitude. Results indicated that students in the narrative treatment groups were significantly more efficient in their employment of instructional constructs when completing in-game tasks compared to those in the non-narrative groups who tended more toward trial and error. Additionally, students in the narrative groups exhibited significantly greater levels of enjoyment for the game. Although not statistically significant, trends indicated that participants in the narrative treatments performed better on the posttest, took less time to complete the game, and perceived reduced levels of intrinsic cognitive load while playing the game compared to those in the non-narrative groups. Overall, this study served as a launching point for future research into how narrative and training can serve to enhance learning and performance in educational games.

Potential applications of VEs include training, visualization, entertainment, design, rehabilitation, education, and research. For many applications, the utility of VEs increases if a person's actions and spatial perception in the VE are similar to those in the real world. Prior research, however, suggests that judgments of the distance between an observer and an external object, egocentric distance judgments , are systematically compressed in the VE compared to the real world. Ideally, we would like to understand the cause of this distance bias and correct for it. While many possible causes have been investigated, the reasons for the spatial bias are not yet fully known. One approach, taken in the present research, is to provide feedback to users in order to allow them to improve the accuracy of their behavior through a process called adaptation . This approach involves an empirical investigation that gives insight into the generalizability of adaptation and the perceptual processes involved in distance perception and adaptation. This insight is valuable from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. In order to determine the practicality of providing feedback to the user within a VE and to gain insight into the process of spatial perception, we investigate three aspects of the generalizability of the effect of feedback. First, we examine whether the effect of perceptual-motor, unconscious coupling between perception and action, and cognitive corrective, conscious awareness of accuracy, aspects of feedback generalizes to both perceptual-motor and cognitive measures of perceived egocentric distance in an head-mounted display (HMD). We find that each of the three methods of feedback cause both egocentric distance judgments to be improved within an HMD. Second, we explore whether, with the same three methods of feedback, the effect transfers from the HMD to the real world. We find that real world egocentric distance judgments performed after experiencing the same visually matched HMD feedback are not altered. Third, in both an HMD and a treadmill-VE, we ask whether decoupling the speed of the visual flow from the walking speed causes real world egocentric measures of distance perception to be altered. We find that this visual decoupling manipulation causes a real world perceptual-motor egocentric distance task to be altered while a real world cognitive egocentric distance task is unchanged. This research demonstrates that VE feedback can be used to improve egocentric distance judgments within VEs for those VE applications that require accurate spatial performance within action space. This research also determines that VE feedback affects subsequent spatial performance within the VE differently than it affects real world spatial performance. In addition, by investigating the generalizability of the effect of perceptual-motor and cognitive VE feedback within action space (2-25 meters) on perceptual-motor and cognitive responses in both the real and virtual world we are better able to infer the cause of the observed adaptation effects. At least four possible explanations could account for some, but not all, of the observed adaptation effects. First, perceptual-motor adaptation, a change in the coupling between the perception of the space and motor information, could account for some of the observed effects. Another cause might be a change in the perception of the space used to inform the response measures. Third, a higher-level cognitive decision rule may be selectively applied to some of the responses. Finally, a re-weighting of cues used for distance perception may occur due to VE feedback.

Edited Book",Chapter,"The M.I.N.D project expects to explore the best combinations of sensory stimuli that create emotional connectivity, create techniques to evoke more effective emotional links and measure these stimuli and techniques for validity and develop guidelines for future emotionally encoded training scenarios. Just as the VRML97 standard advanced virtual environment development by creating a guideline to unify the work done in dozens of individually developed virtual reality team training systems, neuroergonomics standards can help us develop systems that are compatible with natural human behavior for creating safe and comfortable training environments. In addition, methodologies and tools for measuring human behavior, understanding and accumulation of measured behavior, and assisting human behavior, will be developed. This study investigated the relationship between virtual training, physiological coherence, heart-brain synchronization, and cognitive performance in 36 healthy individuals. Subjects performed explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) task with an enhanced VE intended to instill a positive emotional state and increase physiological coherence inside a virtual incident exercise scenario of EOD Training. One VE was using the explicit biocybernetic interface that challenged the self-efficacy and team decision making of the operators in an EOD scenario by linking their heart rates (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA) and electromyogram measurements of facial muscle tensions (EMG) with a Force Feedback Joystick of controlled ""ease"" of movements while engaged in a joint task. The second VE was the same EOD situation environment as the above, but without the introduction of the advanced biocybernetic interface. In both the scenarios the operators had the freedom to communicate verbally while engaged in the common task. Two performance measures were computed: (a) RMS error, and (b) number of groundings. Analyses of RMS error scores indicate that performance improved over the three repeated runs with each VE, as evidence of specific-channel learning. Similarly, performance improved on the first run from Day 1 to Day 2, as evidence of near-transfer learning. However, the advanced biocybernetic interface provided to the first experimental group, provided an additional important statistical performance improvement relative to the ""simple"" VE group and the control groups. The mapping between the type of user-operator state and the type of medium response also had an influence on the level of presence. This project suggests that social-psychophysiological measures and team biocybernetics merit further investigation in sociotechnical systems that demand high proficiency and self-efficacy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"Virtual environments which are presented through virtual reality (VR) systems present a large variety of challenges to specialists in interactive system design and human computer interaction. Virtual and Interactive Environments for Workplaces of the Future (VIEW) was a major flagship project to understand, develop and evaluate VR technologies which would support the workplace of the future. This special issue is devoted to a series of papers that summarize a number of the different facets of this project. The issue opens with an overview paper which summarizes the total project, and puts it in context of general human factors of interaction between participants and virtual environments. Then a series of papers describe the technical developments on the project. A major theme in the project was the development of interaction concepts and devices. One critical element for usability of virtual environment technology has been the control and input devices provided, and one paper reports two experimental studies which compare a number of these and then lead towards design of a next generation. Finally in a departure from the normal sort of evaluation in human computer interaction, one paper report practical evaluations of VR systems that were carried out with actual users in real automotive companies.

This paper describes an exploratory experiment designed to investigate the effectiveness of a prototype of such a system in training a navigation task. A wearable computer, acoustic tracking system, and see-through head mounted display (HMD) were used to wirelessly track users' head position and orientation while presenting a graphic representation of their virtual surroundings, through which the user walked using natural movement. As previous studies have shown that virtual environments can be used to train navigation, the ability to add natural movement to a type of virtual environment may enhance that training, based on the proprioceptive feedback gained by walking through the environment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: route drawing on printed floor plan, rehearsal in the actual facility, and rehearsal in a mixed reality (MR) environment. Participants, divided equally between male and female in each group, studied verbal directions of route, then performed three rehearsals of the route, with those in the map condition drawing it onto three separate printed floor plans, those in the practice condition walking through the actual facility, and participants in the MR condition walking through a three dimensional virtual environment, with landmarks, waypoints and virtual footprints. A scaling factor was used, with each step in the MR environment equal to three steps in the real environment, with the MR environment also broken into ""tiles"", like pages in an atlas, through which participant progressed, entering each tile in succession until they completed the entire route. Transfer of training testing that consisted of a timed traversal of the route through the actual facility showed a significant difference in route knowledge based on the total time to complete the route, and the number of errors committed while doing so, with ""walkers"" performing better than participants in the paper map or MR condition, although the effect was weak. Survey knowledge showed little difference among the three rehearsal conditions. Three standardized tests of spatial abilities did not correlate with route traversal time, or errors, or with 3 of the 4 orientation localization tasks. Within the MR rehearsal condition there was a clear performance improvement over the three rehearsal trials as measured by the time required to complete the route in the MR environment which was accepted as an indication that learning occurred. As measured using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, there were no incidents of simulator sickness in the MR environment. Rehearsal in the actual facility was the most effective training condition; however, it is often not an acceptable form of rehearsal given an inaccessible or hostile environment. Performance between participants in the other two conditions were indistinguishable, pointing toward continued experimentation that should include the combined effect of paper map rehearsal with mixed reality, especially as it is likely to be the more realistic case for mission rehearsal, since there is no indication that maps should be eliminated. To walk through the environment beforehand can enhance the Soldiers' understanding of their surroundings, as was evident through the comments from participants as they moved from MR to the actual space: ""This looks like I was just here"", and ""There's that pole I kept having trouble with"". Such comments lead one to believe that this is a tool to continue to explore and apply. While additional research on the scaling and tiling factors is likely warranted, to determine if the effect can be applied to other environments or tasks, it should be pointed out that this is not a new task for most adults who have interacted with maps, where a scaling factor of 1 to 15,000 is common in orienteering maps, and 1 to 25,000 in (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,,"natural movement, mixed reality, acoustic tracking system, virtual environment","*Human Computer Interaction

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Across a variety of operational environments, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used as a means of simulating hazardous work conditions in order to allow trainees to practice advanced cognitive skills such as problem-solving and decision-making. Replicating dangerous conditions particularly involving heavy machinery in the real world can be dangerous and costly. The use of VR is therefore appealing across many industries such as aviation, mining, and rail. However, while the number of training prototypes increase less focus is being given to appropriate evaluation of the training provided via this technology. Increasing skills acquisition and performance does not depend solely on the appropriate design of simulation training. Of equal importance are strong performance measures which can ultimately feedback on the success or otherwise of training and highlight any deficits to guide ongoing improvements. To ensure cognitive skills acquired in a virtual training environment (VTE) are transferable to the real world, training objectives need to be tied directly to realistic scenario events which in turn are directly linked to measures of specific required behaviors.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The ability to perform accurate limb movements may require learning mechanisms that continually tune the motor system. In the current study, we isolate a form of pure limb motor plasticity. Participants reached to targets that were turned off just after the onset of an initial eye movement, reappearing at a new location at the end of the reaching movement. In contrast to classical prism or virtual reality paradigms, our task eliminated sensory adaptation by always maintaining a congruency between the seen and felt limb position. We also minimized awareness and potential adaptation processes on the basis of volitional strategies by progressively increasing the size of the target perturbations. In this manner, our adaptation procedure mimicked conditions used to study saccadic adaptation. The results indicated that adaptation under these conditions led to a robust after-effect that generalized to a large range of movements within the workspace. This fully natural, non-imposed generalization of adaptation is not expressed in a spatial coordinate system, but more likely in a joint-centered coordinate space.

For each student, the agent used personalized speech (e.g., including I and you) or nonpersonalized speech (e.g., 3rd-person monologue), and the game was presented via desktop computer (low immersion) or head-mounted display (high immersion). Across both levels of immersion, students who received personalized agent messages performed better on retention and problem-solving transfer tests. Although students reported higher levels of physical presence with high rather than low immersion, higher immersion did not lead to better performance on tests of retention or transfer. Students learn more deeply from computer-based simulation games when an on-screen agent speaks to them in a personalized style rather than a nonpersonalized style.

Edited Book",Chapter,"Examines the use of virtual environments (VEs) for learning of the kind expected to occur in schools, colleges and universities, that is, the acquisition of general problem-solving skills, mastery of facts and concepts, and improvement of the learning process itself. This chapter systematically explores the potential of VE for education as well as potential obstacles to its use. In analyzing the major experiments thus far carried out, one can discern various combinations of three basic educational approaches to VE: exploration, world building, and world sharing. This chapter is not a general survey of VE-based educational research. Rather, it examines in some detail six research projects involving students from elementary, middle, and high school as well as college students (ScienceSpace, Virtual Reality Gorilla Exhibit, Virtual Reality Recreational Vehicle, Narrative Immersive Constructionist/Collaborative Environments, Round Earth Project, and ExploreNet. The chapter focuses on two of these projects to explore each of the three basic educational approaches.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Introduction: Research suggests that preflight training in virtual reality devices can simulate certain aspects of microgravity and may prove to be an effective countermeasure for space motion sickness (SMS) and spatial disorientation (SD). It is hypothesized that exposing subjects preflight to variable virtual orientations, similar to those encountered during spaceflight, will reduce the incidence and/or severity of SMS and SD. Methods: Subjects were assigned to either a variable training (VT) or nonvariable training (NVT) condition to perform a simple navigation and switch activation task in a virtual space station. VT subjects performed the task starting in several different orientations, whereas NVT subjects always performed the task starting in the same orientation. On a separate day, all subjects then performed the same task in a transfer of training session starting from a novel orientation. Results: When exposed to the novel test orientation, VT subjects performed the tasks more quickly (12%) and with fewer nausea symptoms (53%) than during the training session, compared with NVT subjects who performed more slowly (6%) and with more nausea symptoms (28%). Both VT and NVT conditions were effective in reducing the number of wall hits in the novel orientation (39% and 34%, respectively). Discussion: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using variable training in a virtual environment for reducing nausea and improving task performance in potentially disorienting surroundings, and suggest that such training may be developed into an effective countermeasure for SMS, SD, and associated performance decrements that occur in spaceflight.

The main contribution is the description of evaluation design including the test instruments, learning tasks and practical experiences with using our system for actual training of high school students. Results of a pre-study with spatial ability tests in high schools are presented.

Learning from media in general is reviewed with particular emphasis on comparisons between visual VE (navigation with joystick) and immersive VE (navigation by walking) simulations. It is proposed that once environments have been learned, three mechanisms act to transform those representations: body movement, mental rotation, and disorientation. Different forms of updating (maintaining orientation during navigation), and different states of orientation are discussed. Existing research suggests that learning from visual information alone is sufficient for constructing accurate spatial memories of environments; however, proprioception is necessary for maintaining orientation within environments. To address these issues, three experiments are presented that examine the formation of spatial memories and their transformation when people learn virtual environments. Experiment 1 found that immersive and visual VE experiences were similar in that subsequently drawn sketch maps did not differ in metric properties. In addition, configural error in sketch maps did not differ for male participants; however, female participants showed less accurate configural maps after visual VE learning. Experiment 2 examined different types of updating processes after people learn layouts. Male participants were able to maintain orientation easily after visual VE experience, showing pointing performance similar to immersive experience. A subset of female participants was unable to maintain orientation with vision alone and showed high pointing error, similar to imagined pointing. Experiment 3 replicated the sex differences found in Experiment 2 using immersive and visual learning experiences before testing. Furthermore, Experiment 3 showed that immersive and visual VE learning experiences lead to spatial memories that are equivalent in that they are transformed by updating mechanisms in a similar manner. Explanations for visual updating differences are considered, including: availability of optic flow vs. landmark navigation; differences in VE interfaces; sex differences in brain activity; differences in responding to visual/vestibular conflicts; and interface proficiency. Finally, the efficacy of VE's used for training, and the use of VE's for the study of spatial cognition are considered.

Edited Book",Chapter,"There is some evidence that Virtual Reality (VR) can contribute the efforts to raise interest and motivation in students and to effectively support knowledge transfer, since the learning process can be settled within an experiential framework. However, the practical potential of VR is still being explored: understanding how to use VR to support training and learning activities presents a substantial challenge for the designers and evaluators of this learning technology. This chapter has the main aim of discussing the rationale and main benefits for the use of virtual environments in education and training. A number of key attributes of VR environments will be described and discussed in relationship to educational theory and pedagogical practice, in order to establish a possible theoretical basis for VR learning. Significant research and projects carried out in this field will be also presented, together with suggestions and guidelines for future development of VR learning systems. However, further research is required, both on technological side and on key issues such as transfer of learning, appropriate curriculum implementation, elements of effective VR design, and the psychological and social impact of the technology use.

Edited Book",Chapter,"Computer Based Learning is well known as a source of effective tools to aid learning processes. There is evidence that computer simulation can contribute to raise interest and motivation in students and to effectively support knowledge transfer. Virtual Reality Environments show potentialities as far as many educational domains are concerned, such as philosophical classes dealing with mainly abstract ethical issues, in that the learning process can be settled within an experiential framework. This chapter analyses the use of a life-simulation game to enhance the understanding and learning of the ethical principles found in everyday life. In the interaction with the virtual environments, personal immersive characteristics represent a very important factor to consider. To this aim, a case study with 8 college students was carried out to assess the influence of immersive subjective tendencies on the transfer of knowledge in the educational process mediated by Virtual Reality Environments tools. The obtained results support the effectiveness of these environments in the learning process and provide a reference framework for teachers and designers interested in this area.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The development of virtual reality (VR) technologies provides a good opportunity to supplement existing diagnostic and training tools for neurological deficits and cognitive impairments because of their experiential, in vivo properties, that simulate real-life situations and can engage the person on cognitive and somatic levels. VR can emulate real-life situations and foster a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive disabilities and individual learning styles. However, even more important is the development of assessment and habilitative tools that address the subjective world of people with disabilities. These diagnostic and interactive training scenarios will enhance learning and skill transfer to everyday circumstances. This paper discusses rationales for developing VR scripts to augment existing diagnostic tools and treatment of cognitive deficits. Key elements of right-hemisphere and frontal-lobe dysfunctions are presented and the capacity of immersive and desktop VR assessment and habilitation strategies to expand understanding of interactive and process-oriented elements of cognitive/somatic learning are addressed. Finally, some of the advantages and limitations of immersive and desktop VR environments are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Outdoor-based experiential training has become a popular technique for training managers by directly involving them in the training process. Outdoor-based programs offer training in a fresh and motivating setting, tend to eliminate many of the role conflicts from the day-to-day work setting, and emphasize many of the interpersonal skills so important in today's work setting. Unfortunately, the value of these programs is often questioned by many trainers and managers. Do the skills learned in the outdoors actually transfer to the work setting, or do they simply work only in the outdoors? Presents a new addition to the outdoor training program called virtual reality training. While not for all organizations, virtual reality training recreates the participant's own work environment in a developmental setting, and helps to increase the transfer of training to the work setting. Presents actual examples of virtual reality programs so the readers can evaluate the effectiveness of this type of training for their own organization.

In an experiment on search and navigation subjects started in a home room and were asked to run through a 4D environment in search of a randomly-positioned target. Subjects were instructed to return to the home room as rapidly as possible upon finding the target. Return times decreased with practice to a value close to optimal. Search for the target also improved in the way expected were subjects learning the layout of the environment. In a second experiment, subjects judged their orientation and Euclidean distance to a distant starting point in 4D environments. A pre-test phase took place in a complex 4D environment with an immersive VR interface. Subjects were then trained in simple, sparse 4D environments using a standard desktop computer interface. In the post-test phase subjects were re-tested in the complex, immersive VR environment. Distance and orientation judgments improved in the training condition. The training also led to improved orientation judgments in the post-test environments, suggesting that this training transferred across interfaces and environments. The results show that one can learn to search and navigate efficiently in environments with four spatial dimensions, and to form global 4D spatial representations.

Specificity has been traditionally defined by starting alignment (e.g. Richardson, Montello, & Hegarty, 1999). Dynamic alignment instead captures the temporal aspect of navigation and is defined by the direction of travel along a particular path through an environment. A series of three experiments examined the effect of training participants using maps, virtual, or real environments to navigate along a route, or way find among landmarks, and learn the names and locations of landmarks. Dependent measures assessed both route knowledge and survey knowledge. After training, participants were tested in the real environment either immediately (Experiment 1) or after a two-week retention period (Experiment 2). For immediate and retention testing, performance after VR training was similar to that after real-world training, and was quicker and transferred better than map training to navigation in the actual world building. However, this was true only when the testing route was traveled in the trained direction of travel, or was dynamically aligned. In Experiment 3, participants were trained on a single route or three routes using a map or virtual reality (VR) model, half of which differed structurally from the actual building by altering the navigational affordances (e.g. locations of walls, doors, and stairs). Participants were subsequently tested using a way finding paradigm. When trained in a modified building and tested in the actual building, VR participants demonstrated attenuated specificity for route measures (navigation) after three-route training, suggesting that the hyper-specificity of VR training can be reduced by increasing participants' functional field of view (FOV). A final pilot experiment comparing training using normal and reduced FOV in the actual building supported this finding.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"College students (in Exp 1) and 7th-grade students (in Exp 2) learned how to design the roots, stem, and leaves of plants to survive in 8 different environments through a computer-based multimedia lesson. They learned by interacting with an animated pedagogical agent who spoke to them (Group PA) or received identical graphics and explanations as on-screen text without a pedagogical agent (Group No PA). Group PA outperformed Group No PA on transfer tests and interest ratings but not on retention tests. To investigate the basis for this personal agent effect, we varied the interactivity of the lesson (Exp 3) and found an interactivity effect: Students who participate in the design of plant parts remember more and transfer what they have learned to solve problems better than students who learn the same materials without participation. Next, we varied whether the agent's words were presented as speech or on-screen text, and whether the agent's image appeared on the screen. Both with a fictional agent (Exp 4) and a video of a human face (Exp 5), students performed better on tests of retention and problem-solving transfer when words were presented as speech versus on-screen text but visual presence of the agent did not affect test performance (producing no image effect).

The head-mounted display VIR system provides a controlled stimulus environment where cognitive challenges can be presented along with the precise delivery and control of distracting auditory and visual stimuli. This level of experimental control allows for the development of attention assessment tasks that are more similar to what is found in the real world and could improve the ecological validity of measurement and treatment in this area. Development of the virtual classroom used a Virtual Research V8 head-mounted display; Ascension Systems head, hand, and leg tracking; and is run on an SGI Onyx platform. Within the classroom, children with ADHD are assessed for reaction time (RT) on immersive visual and 3-dimensional audio attention tasks. Typical classroom distractors are systematically manipulated within the VIR environment, and head turning and general motor movement are also assessed. Methodology for a planned pilot project is described.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the use of virtual environment (VE) technology in the assessment of visuospatial skills of 30 healthy 65-92 yr old community residents. The VE system is intended for application in clinical assessment and rehabilitation of the elderly with CNS dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. The VE Laboratory at the University of Southern California has developed a suite of ImmersaDesk-format, 3-dimensional (3D) projection-based VEs, with scenarios targeting assessment of visuospatial skills, including visual field-specific reaction time (RT), depth perception, 3D field dependency (virtual rod and frame test), static and dynamic manual target tracking in 3D space, and spatial rotation. Ss were administered a standard neuropsychological battery and a suite of VE-delivered visuospatial tasks. Issues addressed include VE-related side effects; the relationship between performance on VE measures and standard neuropsychological tests; gender-specific performance differences; the relationship between immersive tendencies, presence ratings and VE performance; learning and generalization; and VE visuospatial performance differences between younger and older Ss.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Spatial abilities in children have been shown to be related to activity in the environment, particularly to walking and other forms of active locomotion. The objective of this study was to investigate whether virtual reality (VR) can assist children in transferring spatial learning to a real environment. Children (aged 6-8 yrs) were asked to find 10 objects hidden around a room and to try not to visit the same location more than once. Examination of the percentage of correct choices and the visit of 1st error showed improvement as a result of training. There were initial differences between children trained on the computer compared to those trained in the real environment. However, after 3 practice trials, children with the VR training were comparable to children trained in the real space. The implications for utilizing a VR environment for enhancing spatial abilities for children with mobility difficulties is discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined whether the human motor system uses a modular decomposition strategy to learn the visuomotor map, the relationship between visual inputs and motor outputs. A learning paradigm was investigated in which the visual feedback of the hand was perturbed during pointing movements so that a single location in visual space was remapped to 2 different hand positions depending on the starting location of the movement. 32 Ss were exposed in a virtual reality setup to 2 different visuomotor perturbations. Despite the conflicting pairing between visual and motor space, Ss learned the 2 starting-point-dependent visuomotor mappings, and the generalization of this learning to intermediate starting locations demonstrated an interpolation of the 2 learned maps. Results provide evidence that the brain may use a modular decomposition strategy during learning.

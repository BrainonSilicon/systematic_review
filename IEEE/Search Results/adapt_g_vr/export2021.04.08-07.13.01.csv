As mobile wireless communications become ubiquitous, the networks and systems that depend upon them will become more complex. In parallel with this, the spread of digital viruses and malicious content will be an ever increasing threat within this interconnected paradigm requiring counteracting mechanisms to continuously adapt. Current security solutions for mobile devices remain limited in their ability to protect particularly against zero-day attacks. Understanding the propagation characteristics of malware could provide a means to planning protection strategies, but modeling virus propagation behavior in mobile wireless and peer-to-peer communications devices is still immature. A compartmental-based virus propagation model has been developed for Bluetooth communication networks incorporating wireless technological traits and factors that are known to affect virus propagation including human behaviors, heterogeneous devices, and antivirus measures. The model is novel in the richness of its treatment of human factors alongside the technology factors that could impact spread. A simulation scenario, together with an analysis of the spreading dynamics has been conducted to determine how a Bluetooth virus might spread under different conditions. Although demonstrated through Bluetooth, the approach is applicable to malware propagation in general.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268271","Human factors;invasive software (viruses;worms;trojan horses);pervasive computing;wireless","Bluetooth;Human factors;Mathematical model;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Ubiquitous computing","Bluetooth;computer network security;computer viruses;human factors;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;smart phones","heterogeneous bluetooth network;human behaviors;smart phone;mobile computing devices;mobile wireless communication;ubiquitous computing;parallel computing;digital virus;malicious content;interconnected network;zero-day attack;protection strategy planning;virus propagation behavior modeling;peer-to-peer communication;compartmental-based virus propagation model;antivirus measure;human factors;technology factor;malware propagation","","19","","26","","14 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider bilateral teleoperation of a wheeled mobile robot. Our main objective is to combine position-speed command strategy, which is usual for mobile robot control, with position-position command strategy. Generally teleoperation scheme has two control modes, which are position-speed mode and position-position mode. In position-speed mode, a master haptic manipulator's position defines the linear velocity and heading angle of the mobile robot. In position-position mode, the position of the robot is controlled based on the position of the master device. In this paper we propose a strategy to adapt a reasonable control mode automatically. Sonar sensors were used to detect obstacle range information, which is the source of force feedback to human operator. Developed scheme was tested with numerical simulations and experiments. The different types of navigation tasks were evaluated. Productivity, accuracy and usability of hybrid control strategy are analyzed. Flexible and intuitive control was achieved.","","978-89-950038-6-2","10.1109/ICCAS.2007.4406773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406773","Mobile robot;teleoperation;haptic interface;navigation","Mobile robots;Automatic control;Robot control;Sonar detection;Sonar navigation;Haptic interfaces;Robot sensing systems;Robotics and automation;Force feedback;Humans","force feedback;haptic interfaces;manipulators;mobile robots;position control;predictive control;telerobotics;velocity control","position-position command strategy;position-speed command strategy;bilateral teleoperation;wheeled mobile robot;mobile robot control;master haptic manipulator;linear velocity;heading angle;sonar sensors;obstacle range information;force feedback;human operator;intuitive control;flexible control","","23","","13","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These games were developed using Adobe Flash and are accessible through a standard Web browser, making them particularly well-suited for education environments where custom software may be difficult to install. Pilot testing our games with local K-12 classrooms has demonstrated potential benefits in terms of captivating student interest, but has also revealed multiple avenues for improvement and refinement. We have recently developed a unified development platform that overcomes prior architectural limitations to enable dynamic sound processing and synthesis within Flash applications to improve responsiveness and create rich interactive experiences. Since they are constructed in ActionScript, the relatively straightforward scripting language of Flash, these games can be easily extended or adapted to target highly specific lessons and concepts.

At the same time, the number of caregivers is limited and the cost of well-being is increasing. Therefore, there is a recognized need for technologies that assist elderly people in their daily activities and ensure their safety along with their social integration while maintaining a higher degree of independence. One important aspect in the development of such technologies is their easy acceptance by elderly users. Traditional human-machine interfaces have always represented a barrier for the acceptance of new devices by non-technical people in general and by elderly or people with special needs in particular. In this paper, we propose a multimodal interface designed to match the requirements of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems and to fulfill the needs of elderly people who are the main users of this interface. The interface is multilingual, it supports two languages (English and Romanian) and it can process both speech and gesture commands. The interface is developed using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3 and integrates Google Speech Service along with other services. It is able to adapt itself to any screen size and to work flawlessly across different platforms.

We attempt to address these challenges by proposing a dialogue management architecture that has an abstracted view of the world but yet is able to focus on relevant parts of the ontology at runtime. Specifically, we train a sub-domain identifier neural network that learns which features are relevant to the current turn and the immediate future, thus filtering out irrelevant information from the ontology and consequently the belief space at each dialogue turn. We then train a policy network that needs: a) to adapt to the sub-domain identifier's output; and b) to learn what information will carry over from previous turns and when it needs to be updated. We evaluate our method on a large information-seeking ontology that contains latent sub-domains. Our results in simulation and a small human trial show that the sub-domain identifier is able to generalise to unseen domains and achieve performance on par with a multi-domain dialogue manager where each sub-domain is carefully defined (golden standard).","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461754","Spoken Dialogue Management;Multiple Domains;Dialogue Policy;Policy Network","Ontologies;Electronics packaging;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Face;Neural networks","human computer interaction;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;neural nets;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","trained policy models;sub-domain identifier neural network;abstracted view;dialogue management architecture;multidomain dialogue systems;scalable information-seeking multidomain dialogue;multidomain dialogue manager;unseen domains;latent sub-domains;information-seeking ontology;policy network;dialogue turn;irrelevant information","","","","17","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we examine the relationship between the simulated friction parameters of a particular spatial positioning master device and the completion times of planar positioning tasks by human operators. It is expected that increasing the Coulomb or viscous friction of the device would tend to increase the completion times of less difficult, quicker positioning tasks and decrease completion times for more difficult fine positioning tasks requiring higher precision from the operator. A common haptic interface device was used to perform continuous sequences of planar positioning tasks. Each trial required 10-12 minutes to complete and consisted of 15 positioning sequences which varied in the size of the target regions and the magnitude and type of simulated friction in the device. With a sample size of 10 test subjects, small effects were generally observed as expected, with the exception of the first 3 to 4 sequences of the trials which are concluded to be an adaptation or learning period for the users during each trial","2153-0866","1-4244-0258-1","10.1109/IROS.2006.281821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4058515","","Friction;Haptic interfaces;Force feedback;Computational modeling;Intelligent robots;Solid modeling;Imaging phantoms;Couplings;Mechanical engineering;Manipulators","friction;haptic interfaces;manipulator dynamics;position control;telerobotics","haptic interface;planar positioning tasks;friction parameters;teleoperation masters;real-time motion commands;manipulators","","3","","27","","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While it presents numerous advantages with respect to other robot imitation frameworks in terms of generalization and portability, final robot joint trajectories for the execution of actions are not necessarily encoded within the model. This is studied as an optimization problem, and the solution is computed through evolutionary algorithms in simulated environments. Evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations, which had made the use of these algorithms in real world applications very challenging. This paper presents online evolutionary strategies, as a change of paradigm within CGDA execution. Online evolutionary strategies shift and merge motor execution into the planning loop. A concrete online evolutionary strategy, Online Evolved Trajectories (OET), is presented. OET drastically reduces computational times between motor executions, and enables working in real world dynamic environments and/or with human collaboration. Its performance has been measured against Full Trajectory Evolution (FTE)and Incrementally Evolved Trajectories (IET), obtaining the best overall results.

The framework is scalable in the sense that individuals can choose the level of refinement of their curriculum depending on their prior knowledge; is decentralized in the sense that all decisions are taken by the users; and is collaborative because of the possibility of sharing knowledge with other users.

However, they are not as intuitive when having to accurately approach an object, especially when obstacles are present. Alternatively, the combined use of artificial stereovision and eye-tracking seems to be a promising solution, as the user's vision is usually dissociated from their upper limb disability. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a proof of concept for the control of an assistive robotic arm using a low-cost combination of stereovision and eye-tracking.

Innovative technologies and tools are used to provide solutions to existing gaps in current manufacturing systems. The evaluation of scenarios is used to manage risks, costs, prepare for upcoming work and forecast demand. Thus, the use of Digital Twin (DT) has proven its value covering the simulation and creation of virtual environments without the physical investment needed. With emergent technologies comes to a great responsibility for institutes to prepare undergraduate students in the development of novel skills, thus, technologies should be adapted and included into the teaching-learning process to aid the adoption from educational to the industrial sector. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of DT has been used to teach industrial concepts such as the automation pyramid, the programming of programmable logic controllers PLC and the exchange of information through industrial networks along with the concepts that constitute digital twins, such as digital master, digital shadow and modelling through system dynamics.

Currently the mostly used approach uses the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). In order to further accelerate the collision detection speed, this paper proposes a new coherent hierarchical collision detection method. This method takes advantage of the fact that in a clothing animation system, the clothing is generally adjacent to the mannequin when it is dressed, resulting in the two BVH trees for the two models to intersect with near probability one in the upper half layers, thus causing many unnecessary calculations during collision detection. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a collision detection structure with only one axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree for the mannequin and builds an adaptively updated coherent relationship between each clothing vertex and its nearby AABB nodes of the mannequin. With the proposed coherent hierarchical collision detection method, the overall animation performance is enhanced more than twice over the traditional BVH approach. Furthermore, the proposed method is very suitable for parallel implementation, and our simulation using CUDA shows a further 40 times speed-up.","","978-1-4577-0499-4","10.1109/HAVE.2011.6088407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088407","clothing animation;mass-spring model;collision detection;Coherent;BVH;AABB tree","Clothing;Animation;Graphics processing unit;Biological system modeling;Force;Image edge detection;Testing","computer animation;virtual reality","bounding volume hierarchy;collision detection speed;clothing animation system;mannequin;near probability;collision detection structure;one axis-aligned bounding box tree;updated coherent relationship;clothing vertex;coherent hierarchical collision detection method","","3","","30","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing AUVs are usually not fully autonomous and generally limited to pre-planning or pre-programming tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning have been introduced into the AUV design and research to improve its autonomy. However, these methods are still difficult to apply directly to the actual AUV system because of the sparse rewards and low learning efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive reinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the advantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition, since the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running in the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further propose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human rewards and environmental rewards at the same time. We test our methods in two path following tasks-straight line and sinusoids curve following of AUV by simulating in the Gazebo platform. Our experimental results show that with our proposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner from only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from both human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better performance than that with deep interactive RL and can adapt to the actual environment by further learning from environmental rewards.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970433","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976170","Autonomous underwater vehicle;interactive reinforcement learning;deep Q network;path following","Reinforcement learning;Task analysis;Robots;Oceans;Uncertainty;Neural networks;Autonomous underwater vehicles","autonomous underwater vehicles;control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);path planning;robot programming","autonomous underwater vehicle;pre-programming tasks;actual AUV system;low learning efficiency;deep interactive reinforcement learning method;human rewards;environmental reward;deep interactive RL method;AUV learning;deep RL","","4","","32","CCBY","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus understanding human spatial social conventions and incorporating them in the assistive solutions, is important. In this paper, we introduce a semi-autonomous framework for assistive wheelchair navigation in human environments, which is driven by the intention of the wheelchair user. Safe and socially compliant motion provided by a user intention driven local motion planner is fused with user teleoperation in order to create such a system. Taking into account the fact that the user is the primary controller, our proposed system aims to provide progressive assistance whenever the user is in danger of collision or at risk of disturbance to other humans. We also thus propose generalized formulations for estimating user intentions and for sharing control within the context of wheelchair mobility assistance, that is adaptable in order to be deployed in real world systems. We then evaluate the proposed framework in simulation in order to obtain a quantitative analysis. We also provide experimental evidence using an off-the-shelf robotized wheelchair equipped with a single 2D laser scanner.","2153-0866","978-1-5090-3762-9","10.1109/IROS.2016.7759691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7759691","","Wheelchairs;Aerospace electronics;Mobile robots;Navigation;Two dimensional displays;Planning","assisted living;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;optical scanners;path planning;telerobotics;wheelchairs","2D laser scanner;off-the-shelf robotized wheelchair;user teleoperation;local motion planner;user intention;socially compliant motion;assistive wheelchair navigation;human spatial social conventions;assistive robot design;user intention driven wheelchair mobility assistance;human-aware wheelchair mobility assistance;semiautonomous framework","","6","","33","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such abstractions span a range of diverse approaches, each suited to specific ambient conditions and applications. This work proposes an ontology that defines an API for the management of a Virtual Node Layer (VNL) in sensor (or in general, M2M) networks. Such an API can manage regions, virtual nodes and virtual topologies. The management service primitives are independent of the user plane service primitives allowing applications development to take place without considering the characteristics of the underlying network topology in advance of actual deployment. Dynamic adaptation to ambient conditions and service requirements are additionally supported by adopting the most efficient virtualization for the environment of deployment.","2157-023X","978-1-4244-3942-3","10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345589","Ontology;Virtualization;VNL;M2M;API","Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Web and internet services;IP networks;Telecommunication network topology;Availability;Telecommunication standards;Network servers;Web server;Spine","ad hoc networks;application program interfaces;mobile computing;network topology;ontologies (artificial intelligence);virtual reality;wireless sensor networks","ontology based abstraction;M2M virtual nodes;M2M topology;machine to machine;wireless network;ad hoc networks;application program interface;virtual node layer;sensor networks;network topology","","1","","14","","4 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning.

Humans communicate and interact through many vectors, among which are motion and positioning, which can be related to social hierarchy and the socio-physical context. If a robot is to be deployed among humans, the methods it uses should be designed with this in mind. This work acts as the first step in an ongoing project in which we explore how to design navigation methods for mobile robots destined to be deployed among humans. We aim to consider navigation as more than just a functionality of the robot, and to study the impact of robot motion on humans. In this paper, we focus on the person-following task. We selected a state of the art person-following method as the basis for our method, which we modified and extended in order for it to be more general and adaptable. We conducted pilot experiments using this method on a real mobile robot in ecological contexts. We used results from the experiments to study the Human-Robot Interaction as a whole by analysing both the person-following method and the human behavior.

Our method supports the use of 3D imaging techniques for tracking the user's body and therefore it does not require the use of any hand held devices that would restrict the manipulative capabilities of the user's hands. The key contribution of our work is the novel use of characteristic behavioral cues, which are representative for general goal directed movement, to infer the object targeted by the user during selection. The resulting technique enables us to select objects whose largest dimension is smaller than the sensing resolution of our system in spite of body tracking uncertainties and hand placement faults. Furthermore, by means of intention inference, our method automatically adapts to the user's subjective need for variable levels of tolerance to hand placement faults, jitter, or tracking noise.","","978-1-4673-6886-5","10.1109/3DUI.2015.7131736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131736","","Three-dimensional displays;Tracking;Virtual environments;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Imaging;Sensors","gesture recognition;inference mechanisms;user interfaces;virtual reality","intent driven selection method;natural user interfaces;natural hand gestures;virtual object manipulation;3D imaging techniques;users body tracking;characteristic behavioral cues;goal directed movement;intention inference;IDS","","2","","28","","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are working on a simple and intuitive application that enables a student to enter a mathematical equation and to see and touch its shape in 3-D.

Neither the virtualness nor the behaviors of leaders influenced the behaviors of followers in high performing teams. In contrast, in low-performing teams, leaders played an important role in facilitating followers to engage in more leadership behaviors. Generally, over time, in response to the increasing virtualness and behaviors of the leaders, followers responded by engaging in similar behaviors. Following the leader's behavior, however, was dysfunctional for team performance. Our findings suggest that mimicking the task behaviors of emergent leaders who are virtual is not necessarily a formula for successful team performance, especially in self-managed work teams Instead, as shown by the high-performing teams, behaviors that are self-initiated and autonomous-regardless of the leaders' behaviors or virtualness-are what lead to success.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-9618-1","10.1109/HICSS.2011.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718457","","Lead;Context;Media;Humans;Organizations;Virtual groups","behavioural sciences computing;groupware;team working;virtual reality","leader-follower relationship;virtual setting;leader behavior;follower behavior;stability behavior;team performance;task behavior;selfmanaged work team","","1","","56","","22 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If a person can often keep reading habits, reading is the best exercise to prevent loss of cognitive function in old age. With the advanced development of the Internet and the popularity of electron carriers, electronic books (e-books) have been as computer-aided tools to help students learn in the classroom teaching activities. Sensing and clouding storage technologies are used as tools to assist teachers in teaching students to understand the learning status and learning achievement. In general, reading mainly is divided into two phases, learning to read, and reading to learn. In order to understand the learning status of students, teachers observe the learning behavior of students and analyze their learning ability and skills to adjust the teaching strategies and teaching progresses for adaptive learning in classrooms. In order to help teachers effectively observe students' learning, this study proposed a cloudized e-book reading rate tracking system (CERRTS) with an e-book learning environment and the proposed system includes the sensing technology of touch screen and the cloudized technology of storage. In order to verify the function of the proposed system, the study used a camera to record the learning status of students and to compare the reading rate of the system records and the reading rate of the camera recording.

However, there has not been any systematic evaluation of the accuracy of this claim. On the face of it, there are several ways a proactive robot assistant can in fact reduce the effectiveness of teaming. For example, it can increase the cognitive load of the human teammate by performing actions that are unanticipated by the human. In such cases, even though the teaming performance could be improved, it is unclear whether humans are willing to adapt to robot actions or are able to adapt in a timely manner. Furthermore, misinterpretations and delays in goal and intent recognition due to partial observations and limited communication can also reduce the performance. In this paper, our aim is to perform an analysis of human factors on the effectiveness of such proactive support in human-robot teaming. We perform our evaluation in a simulated Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, in which the efficacy of teaming is not only dependent on individual performance but also on teammates' interactions with each other. In this task, the human teammate is remotely controlling a robot while working with an intelligent robot teammate `Mary'. Our main result shows that the subjects generally preferred Mary with the ability to provide proactive support (compared to Mary without this ability). Our results also show that human cognitive load was increased with a proactive assistant (albeit not significantly) even though the subjects appeared to interact with it less.","","978-1-4799-9994-1","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353878","","Intelligent robots;Planning;Human factors;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Systematics","emergency management;human-robot interaction;rescue robots","intelligent robot teammate Mary;human cognitive load;USAR task;simulated urban search and rescue;intent recognition;robot actions;human teammate;proactive robot assistant;assistive robots;human-robot teaming;proactive support;human factors analysis","","9","","25","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Reclose Scheme Matrix - A building block approach to more flexible reclose schemes","K. Smith","ABB Inc., USA","2014 67th Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers","24 Apr 2014","2014","","","607","617","This tutorial based paper provides a unique perspective for adapting today's distribution reclose schemes to modern IED (Intelligent Electronic Device) relays which continue to offer more innovative and flexible solutions. Due to the increased overhead of the IED's configuration requirements that generally accompany these solutions, it is important to structure the settings and logic in such a way that custom solutions can easily be developed. The “Reclose Scheme Matrix” provides this structure. The matrix, a binary representation of the reclose system, is composed of building blocks that are used to design the reclose program. The rows of the matrix are defined by initiate and block signals, and the columns, by the shot pointer. By using building blocks, instead of fixed shots, a greater degree of flexibility can be achieved, allowing for multiple and adaptive sequences. For single pole reclosing, the initiate lines of the matrix can be represented on a per phase basis. The tutorial begins with a basic review of the fundamentals including why reclosing is needed, terms and definitions, and an example of how a typical fuse saving scheme is used to create the matrix. A discussion will then follow on specialized applications utilizing open interval time selectivity and drive to lockout features to fully demonstrate the flexibility and functionality of the reclose scheme matrix. The tutorial concludes with a section on testing and commissioning that emphasizes the benefits of an automatic reclose sequence visualization tool. The tool allows the user to view the settings from the reclose scheme matrix in table format and run test simulations by selecting various initiate input signals.","","978-1-4799-4739-3","10.1109/CPRE.2014.6799032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799032","Adaptive reclosing;building blocks;discrimination time;fast trip;fuse saving scheme;reclose scheme matrix;reclose sequence;reclaim time;shot jump;shot pointer","Testing;Heating;Clocks","distribution networks;education;electric fuses;power engineering computing;power system faults;power system relaying;relay protection","reclose scheme matrix;building block approach;flexible reclose schemes;tutorial based paper;distribution reclose schemes;intelligent electronic device;IED relays;binary representation;reclose program;initiate signals;block signals;shot pointer;single pole reclosing;fuse saving scheme;open interval time selectivity;lockout features;automatic reclose sequence visualization tool","","","","12","","24 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most GUIs do not have a fixed layout, but are resizable and able to adapt themselves. Constraints are a powerful tool for specifying adaptable GUI layouts: they are used to specify a layout in a general form, and a constraint solver is used to find a satisfying concrete layout, e.g. for a specific GUI size. The constraint solver has to calculate a new layout every time a GUI is resized or changed, so it needs to be efficient to ensure a good user experience. One approach for constraint solvers is based on the Gauss-Seidel algorithm and successive over-relaxation (SOR). Our observation is that a solution after resizing or changing is similar in structure to a previous solution. Thus, our hypothesis is that we can increase the computational performance of an SOR-based constraint solver if we reuse the solution of a previous layout to warm-start the solving of a new layout. In this paper we report on experiments to test this hypothesis experimentally for three common use cases: big-step resizing, small-step resizing and constraint change. In our experiments, we measured the solving time for randomly generated GUI layout specifications of various sizes. For all three cases we found that the performance is improved if an existing solution is used as a starting solution for a new layout.","","978-1-4799-0615-4","10.1109/ICDIM.2013.6693970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693970","UI layout;warm start;successive over-relaxation","Graphical user interfaces;Layout;Iterative methods;Runtime;Numerical models;Equations;Linear matrix inequalities","Gaussian processes;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction","SOR solvers;constraint-based GUI;warm-start strategy;computer programs;graphical user interfaces;constraint solver;user experience;Gauss-Seidel algorithm;successive over-relaxation;big-step resizing;small-step resizing;constraint change;GUI layout specifications","","1","","24","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"VIS Keynote Address : When Visualization Met Augmented Reality","D. Schmalstieg","Graz University of Technology, Austria","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","19 Aug 2019","2018","","","1","1","Summary form only given. In the past year, Augmented Reality (AR) has been introduced in several products of premier technology companies, addressing billions of mobile computing users. In particular, a new breed of AR games is engaging and visually appealing. In contrast, non-entertainment applications of AR generally tend to lack sophisticated content. This can be related to the fact that AR developers are only learning how to effectively use the new medium. But it also has to do with the lack of overlap in AR research and visualization research. While AR research has mostly been driven by computer vision with minimal consideration of the visual output, VIS is the field where the perceptual and cognitive foundations of visual information are studied. AR needs VIS! As AR matures, it will be vital to bring the two fields together. VIS needs to address the new medium AR, embracing its two key aspects: mobility and mixed real+virtual perception. AR poses new challenges for VIS, as the visual information needs to adapt to reality rather than shaping the entire visual domain. This talk will discuss fundamental properties of AR visualization and present examples of previous, current and future work.","","978-1-5386-6861-0","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802427","","","augmented reality;computer games;data visualisation;mobile computing","mobile computing;VIS;AR games;augmented reality;AR visualization;visual information;cognitive foundations;perceptual foundations","","","","","","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

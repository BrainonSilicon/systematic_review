Our proposed strategy is based on cross-layer, feedback and neural network techniques. We first determine several relevant parameters which directly impact the quality of video transmission. We obtain the topology change, the signal power information by using cross-layer mechanism. We obtain the packet loss statistics and the network jitter from receiver feedback. Subsequently, we extract their relevant features from those sample data, and take them as the input for training data of the neural network. The predicted result of the neural network would be used as the bandwidth of mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). This parameter will be used to control video encoder to adjust the bit rates of real-time video stream. We have implemented an integrated video streaming system simulation for proving our proposed scheme. In contrast to the conventional transfer scheme, the results of our proposed control strategies indicate that there are considerable improvements in the packet loss and the real time visual quality.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-836-5","10.1049/cp:20070328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4786382","Cross-Layer;Real-Time Video Streaming;MANET;IEEE802.11;Neural Network","","ad hoc networks;bandwidth allocation;mobile radio;neural nets;telecommunication computing;video coding;video communication;video streaming","bandwidth prediction;wireless ad-hoc video communication;real-time video stream;neural network techniques;feedback techniques;cross-layer techniques;video transmission;signal power information;network jitter;receiver feedback;mobile ad-hoc network;MANET;video encoder","","","","","","20 Feb 2009","","","IET","IET Conferences"

We develop a reinforcement learning routing algorithm (RLRouting) to solve a traffic engineering (TE) problem of SDN in terms of throughput and delay. RL-Routing solves the TE problem via experience, instead of building an accurate mathematical model. We consider comprehensive network information for state representation and use one-to-many network configuration for routing choices. Our reward function, which uses network throughput and delay, is adjustable for optimizing either upward or downward network throughput. After appropriate training, the agent learns a policy that predicts future behavior of the underlying network and suggests better routing paths between switches. The simulation results show that RL-Routing obtains higher rewards and enables a host to transfer a large file faster than Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Least Loaded (LL) routing algorithms on various network topologies. For example, on the NSFNet topology, the sum of rewards obtained by RL-Routing is 119.30, whereas those of OSPF and LL are 106.59 and 74.76, respectively.

Although an introduction to PID control is referenced in many textbooks, practical PID tuning techniques applicable to the manufacturing field have not yet been established. As a result PID controllers are often tuned through the experience and intuition of technical staff and operators. In this paper, we introduce a basic PID control lecture outline which avoids complex numerical formulas. In our lectures, trainees can visually learn PID control using a PID Excel simulator, able to simulate process behavior in the case of control parameters changes.Generally, PID tuning techniques are divided into two categories; open-loop and closed-loop types. In the open-loop type, a step response test is required for PID tuning. From this test, the process gain Kp, dead time L and the time constant T are obtained to determine the PID parameters. In practice, step response tests are rarely implemented in the manufacturing field, due to their direct disturbance to production activity. As an alternative method, PID parameters can be determined through consistent oscillation using proportional control alone in a closed loop. However, as consistent oscillation potentially damages the plant facility, this PID tuning method is also not accessible in the field. Therefore, we propose a practical PID tuning method using damped oscillation generated by proportional control. We believe that in light of advanced automatic PID tuning systems utilizing AI technology being introduced in the near future, current service business development in this sector has a tendency to hide the underlying basic technology. To prevent the future industry from becoming blind to basic process control technology, we aim to contribute to the transfer of PID parameters tuning techniques to technical staff and operators working in plants.","1948-3457","978-1-7281-1164-3","10.1109/ICCA.2019.8900005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900005","","Tuning;PD control;PI control;Process control;Manufacturing;Oscillators;Education","computer aided instruction;control engineering education;control system analysis computing;control system synthesis;feedback;manufacturing systems;process control;production engineering computing;spreadsheet programs;three-term control;tuning","practical PID tuning method;advanced automatic PID tuning systems;basic process control technology;PID parameters;technical staff;basic feedback control education;proportional-integral-derivative control;practical PID tuning techniques;manufacturing field;result PID controllers;basic PID control lecture outline;PID Excel simulator;control parameters changes;closed-loop types;open-loop type","","","","12","","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior arts usually focus on preserving the character of a clothes image (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g.long sleeve shirt→arm, arm→jacket), and then determines whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothes details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a clothes warping module warps clothes image according to the generated semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to stabilize the warping process during training.Third, an inpainting module for content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer fine-details.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-7168-5","10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9156594","","Semantics;Clothing;Layout;Task analysis;Shape;Visualization;Image segmentation","clothing;image segmentation;neural nets;pose estimation;realistic images;virtual reality","image content preservation;image visual try-on aims;target clothes image;photo-realistic try-on images;human poses;ACGPN;semantic layout generation module;semantic segmentation;photorealistic virtual try-on;clothes warping module;warps clothes image;visual try-on network;Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network","","4","","50","","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we demonstrate that over-the-air transmissions are possible: We build, train, and run a complete communications system solely composed of NNs using unsynchronized off-the-shelf software-defined radios and open-source deep learning software libraries. We extend the existing ideas toward continuous data transmission, which eases their current restriction to short block lengths but also entails the issue of receiver synchronization. We overcome this problem by introducing a frame synchronization module based on another NN. A comparison of the BLER performance of the “learned” system with that of a practical baseline shows competitive performance close to 1 dB, even without extensive hyperparameter tuning. We identify several practical challenges of training such a system over actual channels, in particular, the missing channel gradient, and propose a two-step learning procedure based on the idea of transfer learning that circumvents this issue.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2784180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8214233","Autoencoder;communication;deep learning;end-to-end learning;modulation;neural network;over-the-air;software-defined radio","Training;Receivers;Communication systems;Artificial neural networks;Hardware;Transmitters;Synchronization","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio receivers;software libraries;software radio;synchronisation;telecommunication computing","two-step learning procedure;end-to-end learning;communications systems;block-based transmissions;receiver implementations;deep neural networks;NNs;block error rate;over-the-air transmissions;open-source deep learning software libraries;continuous data transmission;receiver synchronization;frame synchronization module;transmitter implementations;off-the-shelf software-defined radios","","193","","33","","15 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this system, the construction of a low-complexity detector is quite challenging due to the non-linearity of an end-to-end channel transfer function. Recently, a supervised-learning (SL) detector was proposed by modeling the complex non-linear function as a tractable Bernoulli-mixture model. It achieves an optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) performance, provided the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known at a receiver. However, when a system-size is large, SL detector is not practical because of requiring a large amount of labeled data (i.e., pilot signals) to estimate the model parameters. We address this problem by proposing a semi-supervised learning (SSL) detector in which both pilot signals (i.e., labeled data) and some part of data signals (i.e., unlabeled data) are used to estimate them via expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We further extend the proposed detector for time-varying channels, by leveraging the idea of online learning, which is called online-learning (OL) detector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SSL detector can achieve the almost same performance of the corresponding SL detector with significantly lower pilot overhead. In addition, it is shown that the proposed OL detector is more robust to channel variations compared with the existing detectors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987212","Samsung Research Funding and Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064574","Massive MIMO;one-bit ADC;MIMO detection;machine learning;semi-supervised learning;EM algorithm","Detectors;MIMO communication;Receiving antennas;Uplink;Training;Coherence","analogue-digital conversion;expectation-maximisation algorithm;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;mixture models;telecommunication computing;time-varying channels;wireless channels","data signals;time-varying channels;online-learning detector;SSL detector;OL detector;machine learning detectors;MU-MIMO systems;ADC;uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system;analog-to-digital converters;low-complexity detector;channel transfer function;supervised-learning detector;nonlinear function;optimal maximum-likelihood performance;channel state information;pilot signals;semisupervised learning detector;Bernoulli-mixture model;expectation-maximization algorithm;EM algorithm;word length 1 bit","","","","22","CCBY","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experiments on our newly collected Zalando dataset demonstrate its promise in the image-based virtual try-on task over state-of-the-art generative models.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578885","","Clothing;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Task analysis;Two dimensional displays;Strain;Generators","clothing;electronic commerce;image colour analysis;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);pose estimation;realistic images;virtual reality","VITON;clothing-agnostic;descriptive person representation;coarse synthesized image;photo-realistic image;clothing item;image-based virtual try-on network;online shopping;RGB images","","49","","52","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fully utilize network interfaces on multi-homed terminals and the whole network resources, MPTCP is proposed as an extension of TCP to transfer packets concurrently over multiple paths. Cross layer optimization techniques have been applied for MPTCP such as routing and path management. However, existing multipath routing algorithms and network modeling techniques are facing the challenges of subflow asymmetry due to network heterogeneity, thus cannot handle routing optimization problems comprehensively. To address these problems, in this paper, firstly, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based multipath routing model is proposed to explore the complications among links, paths, subflows and the MPTCP connection on various topologies. Leveraging the GNN model, expected throughput can be predicted with given network topology and multipath routes, which can further be the guidance for optimzing the multipath routing. Then, GCLR, a GNN based cross layer optimization system for MPTCP by routing, is proposed with the help of SDN (Software Defined Networking). According to simulation results, our off-line learned GNN model can predict the expected throughput of specific MPTCP connections with very low error. Besides, it's validated that the model has high generalization ability in terms of connection arbitrary and topology arbitrary, it can maintain MSE (mean squared error) at a low level when the situations are not seen during training, which is sufficient for throughput prediction in multipath routing decisions. Finally, the online routing optimization system is realized using SDN, experimental results show that our proposed routing optimization system can achieve significant throughput enhancement compared with traditional multipath routing algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966045","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957071","Routing;multipath TCP;graph neural network;cross layer optimization;software defined networking","Routing;Throughput;Optimization;Cross layer design;Network topology;Bandwidth;Predictive models","graph theory;mobile radio;network interfaces;neural nets;optimisation;routing protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","GCLR;GNN-based cross layer optimization;multipath TCP;network interfaces;multihomed terminals;cross layer optimization techniques;path management;subflow asymmetry;network heterogeneity;routing optimization problems;graph neural network;MPTCP connection;GNN model;network topology;multipath routes;software defined networking;MPTCP connections;online routing optimization system;multipath routing algorithms;5G networks;mean squared error","","","","48","CCBY","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But, studies show that rising student numbers lead to a high dropout rate. Thus, strengthening the study skills of the students plays a key role in reducing this dropout rate and should be a key objective of every education system. In particular, universities have the power to improve the study skills of pupils at an early stage through the designed programs and measures. With the Pupils' Academy Serious Gaming, the Department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has introduced an instrument to promote the study skills. This initiative aimed primarily at pupils of upper vocational schools (UVS). In addition to the study skills, thus the ability of more application-oriented knowledge transfer objectives and playful introduction to an important enterprise software can be achieved. This paper presents the Pupils' Academy based on the online SAP ERP Simulation Game ERPsim as an example of how the enterprise software SAP ERP is successfully applied to strengthen study skills. In addition, the pupils learn how to deal with the SAP platform and train skills like decision making, analysis, strategy development, data processing and presentation. The positive impact on study skills is evidenced with the help of a self-assessment by means of an IT-based survey carried out by the participating students. These examinations include the activities related to the two study skills time management and teamwork.","2165-9567","978-1-4673-8633-3","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474611","study skills;online business game;didactic framework;IT-based questionnaire;ERPsim;vocational school","Games;Software;Education;Teamwork;Laboratories;Companies","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;serious games (computing)","ERPsim;pupils academy;planning skills;dropout rate;education system;pupil academy serious gaming;Technical University of Munich;TUM;upper vocational schools;UVS;knowledge transfer objectives;enterprise software SAP ERP;decision making","","6","","31","","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

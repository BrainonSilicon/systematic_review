The high-tech environment and unfamiliar nature of RT can affect the patient’s experience of the treatment. Misconceptions or lack of knowledge about RT processes can increase levels of anxiety and enhance feelings of being unprepared at the beginning of treatment. Moreover, the waiting time is often quite long. The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a digital information tool with VR-technology and preparatory information can decrease distress as well as enhance the self-efficacy and health literacy of patients affected by breast cancer before, during, and after RT. A secondary aim will be to explore whether the digital information tool increase patient flow while maintaining or increasing the quality of care. Method: The study is a prospective and longitudinal RCT study with an Action Research participatory design approach including mixed-methods data collection, i.e., standardised instruments, qualitative interviews (face-to-face and telephone) with a phenomenological hermeneutical approach, diaries, observations, and time measurements, and scheduled to take place from autumn 2020 to spring 2022. The intervention group (n = 80), will receive standard care and information (oral and written) and the digital information tool; and the control group (n = 80), will receive standard care and information (oral and written). Study recruitment and randomisation will be completed at two centres in the west of Sweden. Discussion: Research in this area is scarce and, to our knowledge, only few previous studies examine VR as a tool for increasing preparedness for patients with breast cancer about to undergo RT that also includes follow-ups six months after completed treatment. The participatory approach and design will safeguard the possibilities to capture the patient perspective throughout the development process, and the RCT design supports high research quality. Digitalisation brings new possibilities to provide safe, person-centred information that also displays a realistic picture of RT treatment and its contexts. The planned study will generate generalisable knowledge of relevance in similar health care contexts. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394325. Registered May 19, 2020.

This study investigates one particular affordance of VR, namely environmental embeddedness, which enables learners to be situated in simulated or imagined settings that contextualize their learning. A sample of 51 university students were administered written learning material in a between-subjects design study, wherein one group read text about sarcoma cancer on a physical pamphlet in the real world, and the other group read identical text on a virtual pamphlet embedded in an immersive VR environment which resembled a hospital room. The study combined advanced EEG measurement techniques, learning tests, and cognitive load measures to compare conditions. Results show that the VR group performed significantly better on a knowledge transfer post-test. However, reading in VR was found to be more cognitively effortful and less time-efficient. Findings suggest the significance of environmental embeddedness for learning, and provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments, as we remediate learning content from non-immersive to immersive media. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","EEG; Embeddedness; Learning; Remediation; Virtual reality environments","E-learning; Knowledge management; Remediation; Cognitive loads; Immersive media; Immersive technologies; Knowledge transfer; Learning contents; Learning materials; Measurement techniques; University students; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100105880

Such a system should provide an experience so authentic that no further real-world training is necessary, meaning that it is sufficient to train in VR. We evaluate the impact of a haptic thermal stimulus, which is of paramount importance to decision making, on trainees performance and knowledge acquisition. A thermal device was created to deliver the stimulus. As a proof of concept, a procedure from firefighter training is selected, in which sensing the temperature of a door with one's hand is essential. The sample consisted of 48 subjects divided among three experimental scenarios: one in which a virtual thermometer is used (visual stimulus), another in which the temperature is felt with the hand (thermal stimulus) and a third in which both methods are used (visual + thermal stimuli). For the performance evaluation, we measured the total time taken, the numbers of correctly executed procedures and identified neutral planes, the deviation from the target height, and the responses to a knowledge transfer questionnaire. Presence, cybersickness, and usability are measured to evaluate the impact of the haptic thermal stimulus. Considering the thermal stimulus condition as the baseline, we conclude that the significantly different results in the performance among the conditions indicate that the better performance in the visual-only condition is not representative of the real-life performance. Consequently, VR training applications need to deliver the correct stimuli for decision making. © 2013 IEEE.","Firefighters; haptic cues; multisensory displays; thermal; training; virtual reality (VR)","Fire extinguishers; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Virtual reality; Evaluation study; Knowledge transfer; Proof of concept; Real environments; Real-life performance; Training applications; Training scenario; Training Systems; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103091552

However, the educational potential of IVR with children has not been thoroughly investigated, especially as a tool for problem-solving skills. Therefore, this study was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Is IVR a useful tool to learn and practice problem-solving skills? More specifically, do children using IVR solve a game better than those using a tablet application or a board game? (2) Does IVR provide a more engaging experience for children to practice problem-solving skills than on a tablet or a board game? (3) Do problem-solving skills learned with IVR technology transfer to real-life (physical game)? Children (n = 120) aged 7–9.9 years were randomly assigned to a problem-solving game in one of three conditions: board game, tablet, or IVR. The results showed that, overall, the percentage of children who completed the problem-solving game was higher in the IVR condition (77.5%), compared with those in the tablet (32.5%) or board game (30%) conditions. We also found that the interest and enjoyment scores of participants using IVR were significantly higher than participants in the other two conditions, and that the children in the IVR condition were able to learn how to solve the problem and transfer their learning to the physical game. IVR is a technology capable of engaging interest and motivating the user, as well as having the potential to assist in cognitive processing and knowledge transfer. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","21st century abilities; Elementary education; Games; Problem-solving skills; Virtual reality","Knowledge management; Technology transfer; Transfer learning; Board games; Cognitive processing; Educational potential; Immersive virtual reality; Knowledge transfer; Physical games; Problem solving skills; Tablet applications; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099353627

Teachers and students are now forced to teach and study online for an unidentified period, which severely hampers the learning capacity as well the student’s intention toward entrepreneurship. This study compared the impact of traditional teaching and teaching through online management simulation games on student learning performance and further leads to entrepreneurial intention. To further understand the desirability of business simulation games, we used the technology acceptance model (TAM) and extended it by employing knowledge sharing, knowledge application, learnability, perceived pleasure, and self-efficacy as exogenous variables. For this purpose, time-lagged data were collected from 277 students enrolled in entrepreneurship courses in public sector universities. To deal with homogeneity and generalizability issues, students from different collaborative universities were asked to participate in the study. Structural equation modeling was employed for analysis, where the results depict that the students learning performance was enhanced after using simulation games compared to regular theoretical online lectures, which further encouraged them to be entrepreneurs. We also concluded that simulation games are novel and effective online teaching methodology for students during a time of crisis.

Proponents argue that IVR could improve learning by increasing positive affective and cognitive processing, thereby supporting improved performance on tests of learning outcome, whereas opponents of IVR contend that it could hurt learning by increasing distraction, thereby disrupting cognitive learning processes and leading to poorer learning outcomes. In a media comparison study, students viewed a biology lesson either as an interactive animated journey in IVR or as a slideshow on a desktop monitor. Those who viewed the IVR lesson performed significantly worse on transfer tests, reported higher emotional arousal, reported more extraneous cognitive load and showed less engagement based on EEG measures than those who viewed the slideshow lesson, with or without practice questions added to the lessons. Mediational analyses showed that the lower retention scores for the IVR lesson were related to an increase in self-reported extraneous cognitive load and emotional arousal. These results support the notion that immersive environments create high affective and cognitive distraction, which leads to poorer learning outcomes than desktop environments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","affective processing; cognitive processing; multimedia; science learning; virtual reality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089751070

Inhibitory control trainings (ICTs; computerized tasks meant to improve inhibitory control) have shown promise but appear not to be powerful enough to generalize to real-word eating behavior or engaging enough for to sustain long-term compliance. Delivering an ICT through virtual reality (VR) technology should increase intervention power because 3D imagery and actual real hand/arm movements are lifelike and may improve compliance because the VR environment is highly engaging. Thus, we created the first-ever VR-based ICT to test its initial feasibility, acceptability, and impact on binge eating. Method: We recruited participants (N = 14) with once-weekly loss-of-control (LOC) eating to use the VR ICT daily, at home, for two weeks, and measured feasibility, acceptability and change in LOC eating at post-intervention and 2-week follow-up. Results: The VR ICT was feasible to construct and deploy, and demonstrated high acceptability and compliance (i.e., 86.8% of daily trainings completed). Users of the VR ICT experienced large decreases in LOC eating at post-intervention and 2-week follow-up. Discussion: Results from this initial pilot indicate that delivering ICT through VR is feasible, acceptable, and is associated with reductions in binge eating. Future study is warranted and should examine whether a VR ICT can serve as a useful adjunct to standard treatment for BN and BED. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Binge eating; Brain training; Go/no-go; Inhibitory control; Virtual reality","adolescent; arm movement; Article; binge eating disorder; clinical article; feeding behavior; female; follow up; hand movement; human; imagery; inhibitory control training; male; patient compliance; proof of concept; psychotherapy; three-dimensional imaging; treatment duration; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092517372

Yet, methods for testing the fidelity, validity and training efficacy of VR environments are, in general, lagging behind their adoption. There is limited understanding of how readily skills learned in VR will transfer, and what features of training design will facilitate effective transfer. Two potentially important elements are the psychological fidelity of the environment, and the stimulus correspondence with the transfer context. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of VR for training police room searching procedures, and assessed the corresponding development of perceptual-cognitive skill through eye-tracking indices of search efficiency. Participants (n = 54) were assigned to a VR rule-learning and search training task (FTG), a search only training task (SG) or a no-practice control group (CG). Both FTG and SG developed more efficient search behaviours during the training task, as indexed by increases in saccade size and reductions in search rate. The FTG performed marginally better than the CG on a novel VR transfer test, but no better than the SG. More efficient gaze behaviours learned during training were not, however, evident during the transfer test. These findings demonstrate how VR can be used to develop perceptual-cognitive skills, but also highlight the challenges of achieving transfer of training. © 2021, The Author(s).","Fidelity; Police; Policing; Training; Validity; VR","E-learning; Eye tracking; Cognitive skill; Gaze behaviours; Immersive virtual reality; Search behaviours; Search efficiency; Simulation training; Training design; Transfer of trainings; Virtual reality",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100476971

This training typically involves in vivo experience in which trainees and students are exposed to risks such as proximity to infectious disease, behavioral issues such as aggression, and errors in teaching performance. Conducting BST in a virtual reality (VR) context involving virtual individuals with problem behavior may be an effective means of mitigating these risks. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of training students to conduct functional communication training (FCT) in a VR environment using BST. We trained 13 preservice college students to implement FCT for attention and escape functions. We found VR BST was effective at increasing correct steps performed of FCT to mastery criterion levels with all participants. Future researchers should examine generalization and maintenance of VR BST. © 2021 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","behavioral skills training; functional communication training; virtual reality; virtual teaching; virtual training",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099796240

Both the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) require drone operators to keep the drone in sight and avoid flying near people or other objects. From the perspective of the operator, remaining in standing or sitting position while always looking up to monitor the drone movements can cause awkward body postures, stress, and fatigue. Coupled with the mental load resulting from delegated tasks, this could potentially put the drone mission, people, and property at risk. This research investigates the reliability of using the drone operator's physiological indexes and self-assessments to predict performance, mental workload (MWL), and stress in immersive virtual reality training and outdoor deployment. A user study was carried out to collect physiological data using wearable devices and design general population and group-specific prediction models. Results show that in 83% of cases, these models can predict performance, MWL, and stress levels accurately or within one level. This paper contributes to the core body of knowledge by providing a scalable approach to objectively quantifying performance, MWL, and stress that can be used to design adaptive training systems for drone operators. Personalized models of physiological signals are presented as reliable indexes to describing the outcome of interest. Scalability is achieved through the application of generalizable machine learning models that learn the interdependencies between physiological and self-assessment inputs and their association with corresponding outcomes. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Human performance; Machine learning (ML); Mental workload; Physiological signals; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Virtual reality (VR); Wearable technology","Adaptive systems; Antennas; Automobile bodies; Data acquisition; Drones; E-learning; Forecasting; Personnel training; Physiology; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Safety engineering; Virtual reality; Adaptive training system; General population; Immersive virtual reality; Machine learning models; Personalized model; Physiological indices; Physiological signals; Us federal aviation administrations; Physiological models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095978574

To create a sense of immersion, high-resolution images are required to satisfy human visual system, and low latency is essential for smooth operations, which put great demands on data processing and transmission. Actually, when exploring in the virtual environment, viewers only perceive the content in the current field of view. Therefore, if we can predict the head movements that are important behaviors of viewers, more processing resources can be allocated to the active field of view. In this article, we propose a model to predict the trajectory of head movement. Deep reinforcement learning is employed to mimic the decision making. In our framework, to characterize each state, features for viewport images are extracted by convolutional neural networks. In addition, the spherical coordinate maps and visited maps are generated for each viewport image, which facilitate the multiple dimensions of the state information by considering the impact of historical head movement and position information. To ensure the accurate simulation of visual behaviors during the watching of panoramas, we stipulate that the model imitates the behaviors of human demonstrators. To allow the model to generalize to more conditions, the intrinsic motivation is employed to guide the agent's action toward reducing uncertainty, which can enhance robustness during the exploration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stepwise head movement predictor. © 2020 ACM.","360 degree; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); head movement prediction; omnidirectional; panoramic; saliency; VR","Behavioral research; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Decision making; Forecasting; Image processing; Reinforcement learning; Data processing and transmission; High resolution image; Human Visual System; Intrinsic motivation; Multiple dimensions; Position information; Processing resources; Spherical coordinates; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100305639

Since point cloud data is often very large, processing a point cloud may require that it be segmented into smaller clusters. For example, the input to deep learning-based methods like auto-encoders should be constant size point cloud clusters, which are ideally compact and non-overlapping. However, given the unorganized nature of point clouds, defining the specific data segments to code is not always trivial. This paper proposes a point cloud clustering algorithm which targets five main goals: i) clusters with a constant number of points; ii) compact clusters, i.e., with low dispersion; iii) non-overlapping clusters, i.e., not intersecting each other; iv) ability to scale with the number of points; and v) low complexity. After appropriate initialization, the proposed algorithm transfers points between neighboring clusters as a propagation wave, filling or emptying clusters until they achieve the same size. The proposed algorithm is unique since there is no other point cloud clustering method available in the literature offering the same clustering features for large point clouds at such low complexity. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","compactness; constant size; non-overlapping; Point cloud; point cloud clustering","3D modeling; Augmented reality; Deep learning; Learning systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3d representations; Clustering feature; Clustering methods; Learning-based methods; Low dispersions; Overlapping clusters; Point cloud data; Virtual and augmented reality; Clustering algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098157333

Virtual Reality technology is being adopted by many industries for various purposes including safety training for safety critical industries. The future direction of Virtual Reality training requires an understanding of trainees’ evaluation of it; this fact motivated this research. Data were collected from 85 participants using a questionnaire after the training. Observation notes were taken to provide a better understanding of the context. Qualitative research with a thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The results of this analysis revealed that the most salient themes reflect on issues surrounding the realism of the Virtual Reality simulation, namely different emotional and bodily experiences during the training, while the benefits of the training (health, safety, environmental advantages, efficiency and convenience, repeatability and variety of scenarios) make it a good supplement. Nevertheless, improved realism is needed to make it more effective and enhance transfer and acceptance. This study encourages the consideration of important matters (such as realism and emotions) when using Virtual Reality for fire training.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in improving the training and learning domain by using advanced technology such as Virtual Reality (VR). However, a gap exists between storytelling and VR, and it is as yet unclear how they can be combined to form an effective system that not only maintains the level of engagement and immersion provided by VR technology but also provides the core strengths of storytelling. In this paper, we present vIS, a Vocational Immersive Storytelling system, which bridges the gap between storytelling and VR. vIS focuses on vocational training, in which users are trained on how to use a mechanical micrometer by employing a creative fictional story embedded inside a virtual manufacturing plant’s workplace. For the evaluation, a two-phase user study with 30 participants was conducted to measure the system’s effectiveness and improvements in long-term training, as well as to examine user experience against traditional methods of training—2D videos and textual manuals. The results indicate that the user’s ability to retain their training after seven days was nearly equal for vIS and the 2D video-based technique and was considerably higher than the text-based technique. © 2020 by the authors.

The release of commercial VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) has been a major contributing factor. However, there is still much to be learned, especially how views and input techniques, as well as their interaction, affect the VR experience. There is little work done on First-Person Shooter (FPS) games in VR, and those few studies have focused on a single aspect of VR FPS. They either focused on the view, e.g., comparing VR to a typical 2D display or on the controller types. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating variations of 2D/3D views in HMDs, controller types, and their interactions. As such, it is challenging to distinguish findings related to the controller type from those related to the view. If a study does not control for the input method and finds that 2D displays lead to higher performance than VR, we cannot generalize the results because of the confounding variables. To understand their interaction, we propose to analyze in more depth, whether it is the view (2D vs. 3D) or the way it is controlled that gives the platforms their respective advantages. To study the effects of the 2D/3D views, we created a 2D visual technique, PlaneFrame, that was applied inside the VR headset. Our results show that the controller type can have a significant positive impact on performance, immersion, and simulator sickness when associated with a 2D view. They further our understanding of the interactions that controllers and views have and demonstrate that comparisons are highly dependent on how both factors go together. Further, through a series of three experiments, we developed a technique that can lead to a substantial performance, a good level of immersion, and can minimize the level of simulator sickness. © 2020 IEEE.","2D/3D Views; Controller types; First Person Shooter; Gaming; Head-Mounted Displays; Virtual Reality","Augmented reality; Controllers; Diseases; Helmet mounted displays; Contributing factor; First person shooter games; Head mounted displays; Input methods; Input techniques; Simulator sickness; Visual techniques; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099294395

However, the majority of the studies assess the effectiveness of an individual learning in VR, and there is a need to explore more on the effects of VR using different levels of immersion and collaboration. This paper presents an experiment to investigate knowledge transfer in a group-based learning game. We introduce a VR serious game to support teaching and learning processes in neuroanatomy health education. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 23 students to jointly assess learning, knowledge retention, and sense of presence. As a control condition, grouped students assembled a physical model of the human brain, while in the experimental condition, a virtual brain was assembled. In each group, one participant assembled the brain, while the others observed and verbally collaborated in a group-based learning strategy. Results shown high mean scores in the virtual condition. When comparing the knowledge test performance before and immediately after the experiment, we found significant difference only for the virtual condition. The same can be observed for retention. Because of the promising results achieved and motivated by the need of more engaging new tools for remote learning - fully used in quarantine conditions, such as the current one because of the Covid-19 pandemic - we conducted a pilot user study to evaluate the learning effect of a remote version of our collaborative VR game. © 2020 IEEE.","Presence; User Evaluation; Virtual Reality","Augmented reality; E-learning; Education computing; Knowledge management; Serious games; Teaching; Virtual reality; Collaborative groups; Experimental conditions; Individual learning; Knowledge retention; Knowledge transfer; Learning strategy; Sense of presences; Teaching and learning; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099538628

Moreover, it describes an experimental evaluation of the methodology that assessed gain in manual skills during training, transfer of procedural knowledge and manual skills in a final assessment, and changes in self-efficacy with three measurements over time (pre-training, post-training, and post-assessment). Methods: We implemented a VR application that supports the proposed methodology, and can thus be used with or without a mannequin. The experimental evaluation involved 30 participants who tried CPR in VR twice, performing two repetitions of 30 chest compressions per trial. Half participants tried the VR application with the mannequin and half without it. Final assessment required all participants to perform CPR on the mannequin without the assistance of VR. To assess self-efficacy, participants filled in a questionnaire at the three times of measurement. Results: Mixed-design ANOVAs showed effects of repetition, effects of group, or interaction between the two variables on manual skills assessed during training. In the final assessment, participants in both groups correctly remembered most of the steps of the procedure. ANOVAs revealed differences between the two groups only in pressure-related skills (better with mannequin) and in the number of wrong steps added to the procedure (better without mannequin). Mixed-design ANOVA showed a self-efficacy increase in both groups after training, which was maintained after final assessment. Conclusions: The proposed VR methodology for CPR training has a positive effect on procedural knowledge, manual skills, and self-efficacy, with as well as without the physical mannequin. Trials on a mannequin are required to understand the correct pressure for chest compression. This supports the adoption of the proposed VR methodology to reduce instructor and mannequin time required to teach CPR to trainees. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Experimental evaluation; Mannequin; Medical education; Training; Virtual reality","E-learning; Virtual reality; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Chest compressions; Considerable resources; Emergency procedures; Experimental evaluation; Post assessment; Procedural knowledge; VR applications; Resuscitation; adult; advanced life support; analysis of variance; Article; compression; computer simulation; controlled study; emergency health service; female; human; Likert scale; male; methodology; priority journal; protective glasses; questionnaire; resuscitation; skill; training; virtual reality; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092735575

We implemented an immersive VFT within the investigation phase of an inquiry-based learning (IBL) climate change intervention. Students investigated the consequences of climate change by virtually traveling to Greenland and exploring albedo and greenhouse effects first hand. A total of 102 seventh and eighth grade students were randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions: (1) narrated pretraining followed by IVR exploration or (2) the same narrated training material integrated within the IVR exploration. Students in both conditions showed significant increases in declarative knowledge, self-efficacy, interest, STEM intentions, outcome expectations and intentions to change behavior from the pre- to post-assessment. However, there was a significant difference between conditions favoring the pretraining group on a transfer test consisting of an oral presentation to a fictitious UN panel. The findings suggest that educators can choose to present important prerequisite learning content before or during a VFT. However, adding pretraining may lead to better transfer test performance, presumably because it helps reduce cognitive load while learning in IVR. © 2020 British Educational Research Association",,"Climate change; Students; Virtual reality; Declarative knowledge; Immersive virtual reality; Inquiry based learning (IBL); Learning contents; Oral presentations; Training material; Virtual field trips; Virtual learning; E-learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087505916

In this paper, we present the results of a field study conducted in an automotive factory to evaluate an immersive virtual reality training environment (VTE). Set up under real training conditions, the VTE was operated by trainers to train novice assembly line workers on a specific task: the assembly of a vehicle center console. Using a between-subject design we compare training performance in terms of skill transfer and retention between workers being trained in the VTE to workers who had been trained conventionally on the physical car. Our results suggest positive transfer of the acquired procedures from the VTE to physical assembly and even performance improvements over time. We discuss learning success in the VTE in contrast to user experience feedback and the implemented sequence steps for mounting assembly parts, based on comprehensive behavioral data. Finally, reflections on trainer feedback lead the way to implications for the adaption of didactic strategies and operational procedures towards increasing overall effectiveness of VTE-supported assembly training. © 2020 ACM.","Automotive Assembly; Learning Transfer; Trainers.; Training; Virtual Reality; Workers","E-learning; Human computer interaction; Three dimensional computer graphics; User experience; Assembly-line workers; Automotive assemblies; Experience feedback; Immersive virtual reality; Individual Differences; Operational procedures; Overall effectiveness; Technical documentations; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095803774

Laparoscopic training using simulators has been shown to accelerate learning in an efficient and standardized manner. Significant research has been conducted for skills acquisition in abdominal surgery, but in the field of gynecologic laparoscopy the relevant studies are limited. The aim of this study was to compare the training efficacy of virtual reality (VR) simulators and box-trainers (BTs) for skills acquisition in gynecologic surgery, and also to study the transferability of these skills in the performance of more advanced gynecologic operations. Methods: Twenty residents in obstetrics-gynecology with minimal laparoscopic experience were randomized into two equal groups to be trained on either a VR simulator (Group-A) or a BT (Group-B). Group-A was trained on basic tasks (clipping, peg transfer, and cutting), whereas Group-B was trained on ovarian cystectomy and salpingotomy using custom training models. After training, the two groups were assessed on the performance of two laparoscopic gynecologic procedures on a VR simulator (salpingotomy and salpingectomy). Performance metrics included time, instrument pathlength, and various task-specific errors. Results: Both groups demonstrated significant performance improvement in all training tasks, for all but one of the metrics (p < 0.05). After training, both groups had improved performance in the laparoscopic operations using the VR simulator, but this trend was not statistically significant in any metric considered (p > 0.05). Similarly, the post-training performance between the two groups was not statistically different (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Basic skills training on either a VR simulator or BT results in equivalent but not statistically significant performance improvement with more advanced gynecologic laparoscopic tasks on a VR simulator. ©2020 Varras et al.

To this end, we have adapted a fictitious domain method to enable the simulation of hydro-mechanical processes in fracture intersections. The main characteristic of the method is the immersion of the fracture, modelled as a linear elastic solid, in the surrounding computational fluid domain, modelled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid and the solid problems are coupled with variational transfer operators. Variational transfer operators are also used to solve contact within the fracture using a dual mortar approach and to generate problem-specific fluid meshes. With respect to our applications, the key features of the method are the usage of different finite element discretizations for the solid and the fluid problem and the automatically generated representation of the fluid-solid boundary. We demonstrate that the presented methodology resolves small-scale roughness on the fracture surface, while capturing fluid flow field changes during mechanical loading. Starting with 2D/3D benchmark simulations of intersected fractures, we end with an intersected fracture composed of complex fracture surface topographies, which are in contact under increasing loads. The contributions of this article are as follows: (1) the application of the fictitious domain method to study flow in fractures with intersections, (2) a mortar-based contact solver for the solid problem, (3) generation of problem-specific grids using the geometry information from the variational transfer operators. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fictitious domain; Fluid flow; Fracture mechanics; Geothermal energy; Hydro-mechanical coupling; L2-projection; Mortar; Multibody contact problem","computer simulation; fluid flow; fracture flow; fracture mechanics; geothermal energy; hydromechanics; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081641354

Continuing technological advancement, along with a striving for higher levels of immersion, transfer and user satisfaction has driven the design of increasingly complex simulators. Economic viability, portability and usability of such simulators have simultaneously decreased, prompting a contemporary examination of simulator fidelity. Simulator fidelity is a poorly understood construct, notorious for its lack of clear definition. A wide range of terminology is used interchangeably, with subtle differences in the functionality of the language used not always clearly outlined. In the current manuscript, a comprehensive review of the literature informs clear definitions of fidelity, validity and transfer; the terms used are included in a definitions table and their connectivity outlined in a knowledge tree. The aim is to promote usage of clearly interpretable standardised terminology by professionals and researchers alike. The boundaries of the current work are acknowledged. It is suggested that future research should examine constructs such as fidelity, transfer and validity in relation to computational, robotic and automation simulation. The most immediate extension of the current work should capture a requirement to develop effective training interventions to govern operator use of automation using interactive simulation. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automation; fidelity; Simulation; transfer; validity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074573276

In this study, we investigated the influence of context on conditioned fear as well as on generalization of conditioned fear. Thirty-two participants underwent a cue-in-context learning protocol in virtual reality (VR). On Day 1 (acquisition), participants received a mild painful electric shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one virtual room (fear context, CTX+) at the offset of one colored light (CS+), but never at the offset of another colored light (CS-). In a second room (safety context, CTX-), the two lights were also presented, but not the US. Successful cue conditioning was indicated by aversive ratings and startle potentiation but not skin conductance responses (SCR) to CS+ versus CS- in CTX+ and not in CTX-. On Day 2 (generalization), participants re-visited both fear and safety contexts plus a generalization context (G-CTX), which was an equal mix of CTX+ and CTX-. The two CSs were shown again in all three contexts. Generalization of conditioned fear was revealed in affective ratings (CS+ was rated more aversive than CS- in G-CTX), but not in physiological measures (equal startle potentiation to CS+ versus CS- in all contexts). In sum, contextual information modulates the responses to a threat signal such that a safety context can inhibit conditioned fear.

A possible connection between both areas could be used for the recruitment and training of future surgery residents. Aim The goal of this study was to investigate whether gaming skills are associated with better laparoscopic performance in medical students. Methods 135 medical students (55 males, 80 females) participated in an experimental study. Students completed three laparoscopic tasks (rope pass, paper cut, and peg transfer) and played two custom-designed video games (2D and 3D game) that had been previously validated in a group of casual and professional gamers. Results There was a small significant correlation between performance on the rope pass task and the 3D game, Kendall’s τ(111) = -.151, P = .019. There was also a small significant correlation between the paper cut task and points in the 2D game, Kendall’s τ(102) = -.180, P = .008. Overall laparoscopic performance was also significantly correlated with both the 3D game, Kendall’s τ(112) = -.134, P = .036, and points in the 2D game, Kendall’s τ(113) = -.163, P = .011. However, there was no significant correlation between the peg transfer task and both games (2D and 3D game), P = n.s. Conclusion This study provides further evidence that gaming skills may be an advantage when learning laparoscopic surgery. Copyright: © 2020 Datta et al.

However, as contexts and not cues are discussed as the relevant triggers for prolonged anxiety responses characterizing many anxiety disorders, we speculated that it is rather overgeneralization of contextual anxiety, which constitutes a risk factor for anxiety disorders. To this end, we investigated generalization of conditioned contextual anxiety and explored modulatory effects of anxiety sensitivity, a risk factor for anxiety disorders. Fifty-five participants underwent context conditioning in a virtual reality paradigm. On Day 1 (acquisition), participants received unpredictable mildly painful electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one virtual office (anxiety context, CTX+), but never in a second office (safety context, CTX−). Successful acquisition of conditioned anxiety was indicated by aversive ratings and defensive physiological responses (i.e., SCR) to CTX+ vs CTX−. On Day 2 (generalization), participants re-visited both the anxiety and the safety contexts plus three generalization contexts (G-CTX), which were gradually dissimilar to CTX+ (from 75 to 25%). Generalization of conditioned anxiety was evident for ratings, but less clear for physiological responses. The observed dissociation between generalization of verbal and physiological responses suggests that these responses depend on two distinct context representations, likely elemental and contextual representations. Importantly, anxiety sensitivity was positively correlated with the generalization of reported contextual anxiety. Thus, this study demonstrates generalization gradients for conditioned contextual anxiety and that anxiety sensitivity facilitates such generalization processes suggesting the importance of generalization of contextual anxiety for the development of anxiety disorders. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anxiety sensitivity; Context conditioning; Generalization processes; Startle response; Virtual reality","adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Anxiety Sensitivity Index; Article; conditioned contextual anxiety; conditioned reflex; electrostimulation; female; generalization (psychology); habituation; human; major clinical study; male; neurophysiology; pain threshold; personality; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; priority journal; risk factor; startle reflex; virtual reality; white noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077909175

CLICK is an approach that leverages Virtual Reality (VR) technology to provide an integrative learning experience in the Industrial Engineering (IE) curriculum. To achieve this integration, the approach aims to leverage VR learning modules to simulate a variety of systems. The VR learning modules offer an immersive experience and provide the context for real-life applications. The virtual simulated system represents a theme to transfer the system concepts and knowledge across multiple IE courses as well as connect the experience with real-world applications. The CLICK approach has the combined effect of immersion and learning-by-doing benefits. In this work, VR learning modules are developed for a simulated manufacturing system. The modules teach the concepts of measures of location and dispersion, which are used in an introductory probability course within the IE curriculum. This work presents the initial results of comparing the motivation, engineering identity, and knowledge gain between a control and an intervention group (i.e., traditional vs. CLICK teaching groups). The CLICK approach group showed greater motivation compared to a traditional teaching group. However, there were no effects on engineering identity and knowledge gain. Nevertheless, it is hypothesized that the VR learning modules will have a positive impact on the students' motivation, engineering identity, and knowledge gain over the long run and when used across the curriculum. Moreover, IE instructors interested in providing an immersive and integrative learning experience to their students could leverage the VR learning modules developed for this project. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"Curricula; Learning systems; Manufacture; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Industrial engineering course; Integrated course; Integrative learning; Learning by doing; Learning modules; Learning outcome; Probability concepts; Real-life applications; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095792991

In order to make effective decisions, research suggests that explicit knowledge, defined as easily codified and communicated information, and tacit knowledge, considered to be the know-how of completing a task, must be effectively applied. While there is recognition of the need for both forms of knowledge, architecture engineering and construction (AEC) education has historically focused on covering content-related explicit knowledge in the classroom. As a result, students generally develop tacit knowledge over their careers. Due to an aging AEC workforce, there is a need to support tacit knowledge development in the classroom to enable students entering the industry to supplement the collective tacit knowledge that will exit the industry as the current generation of practitioners retires. Therefore, the authors of this paper explore the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to provide immersive virtual experiences aimed at replicating the types of scenarios that students might experience in their careers that would require them to apply tacit knowledge. The authors tasked students in construction-related disciplines with assessing a building design and making judgments about how the design should be modified to support an occupant in a wheelchair in both VR and AR. Using two similar models and a counterbalanced research methodology, the authors coded the statements and behaviors of the student participants during this design assessment exercise. The results of this work indicate that both technologies elicited statements that were indicative of explicit knowledge related to the needs of a wheelchair-bound occupant. When AR and VR were found to directly encourage physical exploration in the experience, both led to behaviors that simulated the completion of tasks that might be performed by a wheelchair-bound occupant. These behaviors were frequently followed by comments that were indicative of tacit knowledge. While this type of behavior was observed in both AR and VR, AR seemed to more directly encourage this type of interaction among participants. The contribution of this work is in providing observational evidence to demonstrate how the physical exploration affordances of AR and VR may be able to support experiences that foster the use and development of tacit knowledge related to AEC-related decision-making. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Architectural design; Augmented reality; Building codes; Construction; Decision making; Education computing; Students; Technology transfer; Virtual reality; Wheelchairs; Architecture engineering; Augmented and virtual realities; Current generation; Design and construction; Design assessments; Explicit knowledge; Industry standards; Research methodologies; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082121907

One strategy to combat this stress is to practice clinical skills in the less intimidating and safe environment of simulation. Evidence strongly suggests that simulation is an important component of a well-rounded nurse anesthesia program. However, no simulation literature was found to assist the transition of student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs) into their cardiac anesthesia rotations. The purpose of this evidence-based practice improvement project was to create an open-heart surgery simulation that supplemented the cardiac curriculum of second-year SRNAs, in order to improve self-efficacy prior to their cardiac clinical rotation. Twenty-three SRNAs, enrolled in a nurse anesthesia doctorate of nursing practice program, participated in the anesthesia simulation in cardiac surgery. After the students' anesthesia simulation experience, they shared in a debriefing session and completed a survey-based evaluation. When SRNAs were asked their level of agreement to the statement “I am confident that I am developing the skills and obtaining the required knowledge from this simulation to perform necessary tasks in a clinical setting,” the mean score was 4.61, with 5 indicating strongly agree.

An immersive video contains much more interesting information within the 360° environment than normal videos. There can be multiple interesting areas within a 360° frame at the same time. Due to the narrow field of view in virtual reality head-mounted displays, a user can only view a limited area of a 360° video. Hence, our system is aimed at generating multiple experiences based on interesting information in different regions of a 360° video and ecient transferring of these experiences to prospective users. The proposed system generates experiences by using two approaches: (1) Recording of the user's experience when the user watches a panoramic video using a virtual reality head-mounted display, and (2) tracking of an arbitrary interesting object in a 360° video selected by the user. For tracking of an arbitrary interesting object, we have developed a pipeline around an existing simple object tracker to adapt it for 360° videos. This tracking algorithm was performed in real time on a CPU with high precision. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such existing system that can generate a variety of different experiences from a single 360° video and enable the viewer to watch one 360° visual content from various interesting perspectives in immersive virtual reality. Furthermore, we have provided an adaptive focus assistance technique for ecient transferring of the generated experiences to other users in virtual reality. In this study, technical evaluation of the system along with a detailed user study has been performed to assess the system's application. Findings from evaluation of the system showed that a single 360° multimedia content has the capability of generating multiple experiences and transfers among users. Moreover, sharing of the 360° experiences enabled viewers to watch multiple interesting contents with less effort. © 2020 by the authors.","360° video experiences; object tracking; Authoring system; Experience transfer; Focus assistance; Human-computer interaction (HCI); Virtual reality; Visualization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083571542

Given the unique features of virtual reality in terms of interaction and its ability to completely immerse the individual into the game, this technology should increase the propensity for video games to effectively elicit positive emotions and decrease negative emotions and anxiety in the players. However, to date, few studies have investigated the ability of virtual reality games to induce positive emotions, and the possible effect of this new type of video game in diminishing negative emotions and anxiety has not yet been tested. Furthermore, given the critical role of body movement in individuals’ well-being and in emotional responses to video games, it seems critical to investigate how body involvement can be exploited to modulate the psychological benefits of virtual reality games in terms of enhancing players’ positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions and anxiety. Objective: This within-subjects study aimed to explore the ability of commercial virtual reality games to induce positive emotions and diminish negative emotions and state anxiety of the players, investigating the effects of the level of body involvement requested by the game (ie, high vs low). Methods: A total of 36 young adults played a low body-involvement (ie, Fruit Ninja VR) and a high body-involvement (ie, Audioshield) video game in virtual reality. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Form-Y1 (STAI-Y1) were used to assess positive and negative emotions and state anxiety. Results: Results of the generalized linear model (GLM) for repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a statistically significant increase in the intensity of happiness (P<.001) and surprise (P=.003) and, in parallel, a significant decrease in fear (P=.01) and sadness (P<.001) reported by the users. Regarding the ability to improve anxiety in the players, the results showed a significant decrease in perceived state anxiety after game play, assessed with both the STAI-Y1 (P=.003) and the VAS-anxiety (P=.002). Finally, the results of the GLM MANOVA showed a greater efficacy of the high body-involvement game (ie, Audioshield) compared to the low body-involvement game (ie, Fruit Ninja VR), both for eliciting positive emotions (happiness, P<.001; and surprise, P=.01) and in reducing negative emotions (fear, P=.05; and sadness, P=.05) and state anxiety, as measured by the STAI-Y1 (P=.05). Conclusions: The two main principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) virtual reality video games appear to be effective tools to elicit positive emotions and to decrease negative emotions and state anxiety in individuals and (2) the level of body involvement of the virtual video game has an important effect in determining the ability of the game to improve positive emotions and decrease negative emotions and state anxiety of the players. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

However, any differences in autonomic cardiovascular adaptations are still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that WI induces a higher activation of arterial baroreceptors and the parasympathetic system. Methods: Ten healthy men underwent 30 min of WI, HDT, and a supine position (SP). RR intervals (RRI) and blood pressure (BP) were continuously monitored. High frequency power (HF), low frequency power (LF) and LF/HF ratio were calculated to study sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, and a spontaneous baroreflex method was used to study arterial baroreflex sensitivity (aBRS). Lung transfer of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide (TLNO/TLCO), vital capacity and alveolar volume (Vc/VA) were measured to study central blood redistribution. Results: We observed (1) a similar increase in RRI and decrease in BP; (2) a similar increase in HF power during all experimental conditions, whereas LF increased after; (3) a similar rise in aBRS; (4) a similar increase in Vc/VA and decrease in TLNO/TLCO in all experimental conditions. Conclusions: These results showed a cardiac parasympathetic dominance to the same extent, underpinned by a similar arterial baroreflex activation during WI and HDT as well as control SP. Future studies may address their association with cold or hyperoxia to assess their ability to replicate autonomic cardiovascular adaptations to microgravity, swimming or scuba diving. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Arterial baroreflex sensitivity; Autonomic nervous system; Cardiovascular system; Head-down tilt; Supine position; Thermoneutral head-out water immersion","water; acclimatization; adult; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; head-down tilt; heart rate; human; male; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex; supine position; weightlessness; young adult; Acclimatization; Adult; Autonomic Nervous System; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Head-Down Tilt; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Supine Position; Water; Weightlessness; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076397774

Background: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of whether or not these manipulations are effective for training has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered. Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their efficacy as training tools has been debated. Method: The current body of literature was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors, trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on performance measures after XR-based training. Results: Results showed that training in XR does not express a different outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance. Conclusion: Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods, such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional training impossible. © Copyright 2020, Commonwealth of Australia, as represented by the Department of Defence, Science, and Technology.","immersive environments; meta-analysis; transfer of training; virtual environments","Augmented reality; Mixed reality; Virtual reality; Control environment; Empirical findings; Immersive environment; Meta analysis; Performance measure; Training enhancement; Training methods; Transfer of trainings; E-learning; article; augmented reality; effect size; human; meta analysis; transfer of learning; virtual reality",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081603757

This study is among the first to explore the use of a Multi-User Virtual Reality (MUVR) system as a therapeutic medium for participants at high-risk for developing Eating Disorders. This paper demonstrates the positive effect of using MUVR remote psychotherapy to enhance traditional therapeutic practices. The study capitalises on the opportunities which are offered by a MUVR remote psychotherapeutic session to enhance the outcome of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Play Therapy and Exposure Therapy for sufferers with body shape and weight concerns. Moreover, the study presents the design opportunities and challenges of such technology, while strengths on the feasibility, and the positive user acceptability of introducing MUVR to facilitate remote psychotherapy.

Viewers can feel isolated when watching omnidirectional movies with HMDs. Even if they are watching the movie simultaneously, they do not automatically see the same field of view, since they can freely choose their viewing direction. Our goal is to explore interaction techniques to efficiently support social viewing and to improve social movie experiences in CVR. Based on the literature review and insights from earlier work, we identify seven challenges that need to be addressed: communication, field-of-view (FoV) awareness, togetherness, accessibility, interaction techniques, synchronization, and multiuser environments. We investigate four aspects (voice chat, sending emotion states, FoV indication, and video chat) to address some of the challenges and report the results of four user studies. Finally, we present and discuss a design space for CVR social movie applications and highlight directions for future work. © 2020, The Author(s).","360° video; Cinematic virtual reality; Interactive TV; Omnidirectional video; Social viewing","Helmet mounted displays; Motion pictures; Technology transfer; Design spaces; Field of views; Head mounted displays; Interaction techniques; Literature reviews; Multiuser environments; User study; Viewing directions; Virtual reality",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092676924

For a VR simulation to elicit effective transfer of training to the real-world, it must provide a sufficient level of validity, that is, it must be representative of the real-world skill. In order to develop the most effective simulations, assessments of validity should be carried out prior to implementing simulations in training. The aim of this work was to test elements of the physical fidelity, psychological fidelity and construct validity of a VR golf putting simulation. Self-report measures of task load and presence in the simulation were taken following real and simulated golf putting to assess psychological and physical fidelity. The performance of novice and expert golfers in the simulation was also compared as an initial test of construct validity. Participants reported a high degree of presence in the simulation, and there was little difference between real and virtual putting in terms of task demands. Experts performed significantly better in the simulation than novices (p =.001, d = 1.23), and there was a significant relationship between performance on the real and virtual tasks (r =.46, p =.004). The results indicated that the simulation exhibited an acceptable degree of construct validity and psychological fidelity. However, some differences between the real and virtual tasks emerged, suggesting further validation work is required. © 2020, The Author(s).","Construct validity; Simulation; Sport; Training; VR","Golf; User experience; Construct validity; Nuclear decommissioning; Real-world; Task demand; Test elements; Training purpose; Transfer of trainings; VR simulation; Virtual reality",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092909275

The vSocial can be used to: (a) implement multiple learning modules using wearable VR technologies, (b) integrate cognitive state sensing devices, and (c) organize learning session data securely using web applications hosted on cloud resources. Our experiment results show that the VR mode of content delivery in vSocial better stimulates the generalization of lessons to the real world than non-VR lessons, and provides improved immersion when compared to an equivalent desktop version. Further, usability study results show that users can successfully use the web application features in vSocial for group learning activities with ease-of-use and consistency. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Intelligent network services; Learning environments; Social virtual reality; Special education; Web applications","Compliance control; Computer aided instruction; HIgh speed networks; Learning systems; Regulatory compliance; Students; User experience; Virtual reality; Wearable technology; Autism spectrum disorders; Learning effectiveness; Learning sessions; Social competences; Special education; Usability studies; Virtual learning environments (VLEs); Virtual reality learning environments; E-learning",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085874226

However, it remains unclear how winning or losing might influence player's engagement. In a recent study, we used behavioral metrics to quantify player engagement during competitive gameplay in virtual reality. To control for players' status of winning or losing, we programmed a virtual opponent to either under-perform, over-perform, or tie with them. We conducted a series of experiments and found that players' engagement was higher when they were losing, compared to when they played alone. Nevertheless, players' engagement did not change during competition with an under-performing or equally-performing opponent. By applying the information-theoretic notion of transfer entropy, we unveiled a causal relationships between relative performance and engagement, whereby players monitored the scores and adapted their behavior accordingly. However, behavioral metrics are not detached from volition and may be influenced by confounding factors. This limitation is addressed by the use of physiological metrics, which offer largely unbiased measurements of cognitive and emotional processes. In the present study, we sought to strengthen our prior findings by measuring engagement with a physiological correlate. We conducted experiments in the same experimental setting and we measured players' galvanic skin response during competition. We discovered that players' skin conductance was higher when they were outperformed by their opponent, indicating that they were experiencing less flow. The results inform the design of technology-mediated applications toward sustaining user engagement and participation.

We aim to identify the currently available simulators and training courses for neurosurgery, assess their validity, and determine their effectiveness. Methods: Both MEDLINE and Embase were searched for English language articles which validate simulation models for neurosurgery. Each study was screened according to the Messick validity framework and rated in each domain. The McGaghie model of translational outcomes was then used to determine a level of effectiveness (LoE) for each simulator or training course. Results: On screening of 6006 articles, 114 were identified to either validate or determine an LoE for 108 simulation-based training models or courses. Achieving the highest rating for each validity domain were 6 models and training courses for content validity, 12 for response processes, 4 for internal structure, 14 for relations to other variables, and none for consequences. For translational outcomes, 6 simulators or training achieved an LoE >2 and thus showed skills transfer beyond the simulation setting. Conclusions: With the advent of increasing neurosurgery simulators and training tools, there is a need for more validity studies. Further attempts to investigate translational outcomes to the operating theater when using these simulators is particularly warranted. More training tools incorporating full-immersion simulation and nontechnical skills training are recommended. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Education; Neurosurgery; Simulation; Training","Article; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; endoscopic endonasal surgery; human; neurosurgery; simulation training; surgical training; systematic review; transsphenoidal surgery; ventriculostomy; brain; clinical competence; education; neurosurgery; procedures; simulation training; skull; surgery; Brain; Clinical Competence; Humans; Neurosurgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Skull",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073812751

Thus, we provide a brief, representative and non-exhaustive review of the current research studies, in order to examine the effects, as well as the impact of VR/AR technologies on K-12, higher and tertiary education students’ twenty-first century skills and their overall learning. According to the literature, there are promising results indicating that VR/AR environments improve learning outcomes and present numerous advantages of investing time and financial resources in K-12, higher and tertiary educational settings. Technological tools such as VR/AR improve digital-age literacy, creative thinking, communication, collaboration and problem solving ability, which constitute the so-called twenty-first century skills, necessary to transform information rather than just receive it. VR/AR enhances traditional curricula in order to enable diverse learning needs of students. Research and development relative to VR/AR technology is focused on a whole ecosystem around smart phones, including applications and educational content, games and social networks, creating immersive three-dimensional spatial experiences addressing new ways of human–computer interaction. Raising the level of engagement, promoting self-learning, enabling multi-sensory learning, enhancing spatial ability, confidence and enjoyment, promoting student-centered technology, combination of virtual and real objects in a real setting and decreasing cognitive load are some of the pedagogical advantages discussed. Additionally, implications of a growing VR/AR industry investment in educational sector are provided. It can be concluded that despite the fact that there are various barriers and challenges in front of the adoption of virtual reality on educational practices, VR/AR applications provide an effective tool to enhance learning and memory, as they provide immersed multimodal environments enriched by multiple sensory features. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Higher education; K-12; Tertiary education; Twenty-first century skills; Virtual and augmented reality","Augmented reality; Computer games; E-learning; Human computer interaction; Problem solving; Smartphones; Social sciences computing; Virtual reality; Higher education; Multi-sensory learning; Problem-solving abilities; Research and development; State-of-the-art approach; Tertiary education; Twenty-first century skills; Virtual and augmented reality; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053216727

We include five types of learning outcomes including post-test enjoyment ratings; pre- to post-test changes in intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy; a post-test multiple choice retention test; and two behavioral transfer tests. Results indicated that the groups did not differ on the immediate retention test, suggesting that all three media were equivalent in conveying the basic knowledge.

Most human navigation simulation approaches focus on the classic psychology evidence, or assumptions that still need further proofs. The overly simplified and generalized assumption of navigation behaviors does not highlight the need of capturing individual differences in spatial cognition and navigation decision-making, or the impacts of diverse ways of spatial information display. This study proposes the visual attention patterns in floorplan review to be a stronger predictor of human navigation behaviors. To set the theoretical foundation, a Virtual Reality (VR) experiment was performed to test if visual attention patterns during spatial information review can predict the quality of spatial memory, and how the relationship is affected by the diverse ways of information display, including 2D, 3D and VR.

However, there is not such a substantial amount of work exploring the combination of AR with game-based learning (ARGBL). Although ARGBL has the potential to enable new forms of teaching and transform the learning experience, it remains unclear how ARGBL applications can impact students’ motivation, achievements, and learning performance. This study reports a systematic review of the literature on ARGBL approaches in compulsory education considering the advantages, disadvantages, instructional affordances, and/or effectiveness of ARGBL across various primary and secondary education subjects. In total, 21 studies published between 2012 and 2017 in 11 indexed journals were analysed, with 14 studies focusing on primary education and 7 on secondary. The main findings from this review provide the current state of the art research in ARGBL in compulsory education. Trends and the vision towards the future are also discussed, as ARGBL can potentially influence the students’ attendance, knowledge transfer, skill acquisition, hands-on digital experience, and positive attitude towards their learning. This review aims to lay the groundwork for educators, technology developers, and other stakeholders involved in the development of literacy programmes for young children by offering new insights with effective advice and suggestions on how to increase student motivation and improve learning outcomes and the learning experience by incorporating ARGBL into their teaching. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Augmented reality; Game-based learning; Primary education; Secondary education; Systematic review","Augmented reality; Knowledge management; Motivation; Game-based Learning; Learning experiences; Learning performance; Primary and secondary education; Primary and secondary schools; Primary education; Student motivation; Systematic Review; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047192636

Direct relationships between active agency in VR and skill improvement have previously not been investigated. This study examined the relationship between (a) presence and agency, and (b) presence and skills improvement, via active and passive VR simulations and through measuring real-world golf-putting skill. Participants (n = 23) completed baseline putting skill assessment before using an Oculus Rift VR head-mounted display to complete active (putting with a virtual golf club) and passive (watching a game of golf) VR simulations. Measures of presence and agency were administered after each simulation, followed by a final putting skill assessment. The active simulation induced higher feelings of general presence and agency. However, no relationship was identified between presence and either agency or skill improvement. No skill improvement was evident in either the active or passive simulations, potentially due to the short training period applied, as well as a lack of realism in the VR simulations inhibiting a transfer of skills to a real environment.

Such evaluation is motivated by the need to facilitate transfer of model/knowledge from VE to the Real Environment (RE), where it is crucial for the VE to trigger similar user behavior as in the RE. This paper discusses the application of such concept to evaluate interactions of forklift operation in the VE. First, a Virtual Reality (VR) forklift simulator is developed using motion capture and 3D reconstruction methods to mimic HMI of the real forklift operation. Then, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is used for temporal evaluation of operation behaviors in VE and RE. Results of DTW (i.e. distance and correlation) are used as objective measures to evaluate fidelity of VE during forklift operations on the simulator. Results suggest the proposed forklift simulator triggers operation behavior which is similar (highly correlated) to that of real forklift operation. The contributions of this paper are (a) the novel VR forklift simulator system to realize interactions of real forklift in the VE, and (b) the proposed objective measures for temporal evaluation of the fidelity of VE. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Behavioral research; Intelligent robots; Man machine systems; Materials handling equipment; Simulators; Dynamic time warping algorithms; Evaluation methodologies; Highly-correlated; Human-machine interaction; Objective measure; Real environments; Simulator systems; Temporal evaluation; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078030425

Virtual Reality has demonstrated advantages applied to Education, providing immersive experiences and new ways of visualization and interaction. However, this technology has not been extensively explored in Software Engineering. In this sense, this paper aims to present a disruptive method of teaching and learning support on fundamentals in object orientation paradigm based on Immersive Learning, called OO Game VR. In addition, an initial heuristic evaluation was performed with 6 subjects in order to identify usability problems. Despite problems found related to support learning, navigation and orientation, the natural expression of action and clear entry and exit points, the subjects were able to perform all the tasks, showing indications that the application has the potential to support teaching of OOP teaching through Immersive Learning.

We investigated in healthy volunteers whether HDBR, with or without countermeasures, affect cerebral autoregulation (CA). Twelve men (at selection: 34 ± 7 years; 176 ± 7 cm; 70 ± 7 kg) underwent three interventions of a 21-day HDBR: a control condition without countermeasure (CON), a condition with resistance vibration exercise (RVE) comprising of squats, single leg heel, and bilateral heel raises and a condition using also RVE associated with nutritional supplementation (NeX). Cerebral blood flow velocity was assessed using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. CA was evaluated by transfer function analysis and by the autoregulatory index (Mxa) in order to determine the relationship between mean cerebral blood flow velocity and mean arterial blood pressure. In RVE condition, coherence was increased after HDBR. In CON condition, Mxa index was significantly reduced after HDBR. In contrast, in RVE and NeX conditions, Mxa were increased after HBDR. Our results indicate that HDBR without countermeasures may improve dynamic CA, but this adaptation may be dampened with RVE. Furthermore, nutritional supplementation did not enhance or worsen the negative effects of RVE. These findings should be carefully considered and could not be applied in spaceflight. Indeed, the subjects spent their time in supine position during bed rest, unlike the astronauts who perform normal daily activities. © Copyright © 2019 Kermorgant, Nasr, Custaud, Navasiolava, Arbeille, Guinet, Labrunée, Besnier, Arvanitis, Czosnyka, Senard and Pavy-Le Traon.","cerebral autoregulation; head-down bed rest; microgravity; nutritional supplementation; resistance vibration exercise","adult; article; autoregulation; bed rest; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; clinical article; controlled study; cosmonaut; daily life activity; diet supplementation; heel; human; human experiment; male; mean arterial pressure; microgravity; resistance training; space flight; supine position; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072725415

However, widespread adoption has continually languished below purported potential. We suggest that a more complete understanding of the underlying motives driving users to take advantage of VR and AR would aid researchers by consolidating fragmented knowledge across domains and by identifying paths for additional inquiry. Additionally, practitioners could identify areas of unmet motives for using VR and AR. To examine the motives for virtualization, we draw upon Gibson’s seminal work on affordances to create a framework of generalized affordances for virtually assisted activities relative to the affordances of physical reality. This framework facilitates comparison of virtualized activities to non-virtualized activities, comparison of similar activities across VR and AR, and delineates areas of inquiry for future research. The validity of the framework was explored through two quantitative studies and one qualitative study of a wide variety of professionals. We found that participants perceive a significant difference between physical reality and both VR and AR for all proposed affordances, and that for many affordances, users perceive a difference in the ability of AR and VR to enact them. The qualitative study confirmed the general structure of the framework, while also revealing additional sub-affordances to explore. Theoretically, this suggests that examining the affordances that differentiate these technologies from physical reality may be a valid approach to understanding why users adopt these technologies. Practitioners may find success by focusing development on the specific affordances that VR or AR is best equipped to enact. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adoption motivations; augmented reality; technology adoption; technology affordances; theoretical framework; virtual reality; virtually assisted activities","Augmented reality; Virtual reality; Adoption motivations; Technology adoption; Technology affordances; Theoretical framework; virtually assisted activities; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070323987

Without it, we cannot understand our environment, situate ourselves within it, or remember where items are located. Most research on the neural basis of spatial memory is conducted either with invasive brain recordings from animals or with non-invasive imaging in humans. An emerging way to link these areas is by studying rare invasive recordings from the human brain, which can be obtained from epilepsy patients who have electrodes surgically implanted for seizure mapping. In recent years this invasive method has expanded our understanding of how the human brain represents space and has also suggested methods for modulating and potentially rehabilitating memory. However, it is unclear whether these results from epilepsy patients generalize to the non-epileptic population, and from testing in hospital rooms to more immersive and comfortable setups. Here, groups of epilepsy patients (n=69) and healthy participants (n=17) performed the same virtual spatial memory task, enabling us to compare their spatial memory performance. Moreover, we compared spatial memory performance between a standard computer screen versus a head-mounted display. We found that the spatial memory performance of epilepsy patients performing our task in a hospital was similar to that of matched healthy participants performing the task in the lab. Furthermore, actual spatial memory performance was similar on the group level irrespective of the interface used, despite the fact that subjects reported higher immersion with the head mounted display. By showing consistent spatial memory performance with a single paradigm across epilepsy patients and healthy participants, as well as with the use of different display modalities, our results provide a baseline for evaluating findings regarding the neural basis of spatial memory and neuromodulation for rehabilitation. More broadly, these results demonstrate that findings from neurosurgical patients are comparable to the wider population. © 2019 IEEE.","Epilepsy; Immersive; Memory Rehabilitation; Spatial memory; Virtual Reality","Brain; Brain mapping; Helmet mounted displays; Hospitals; Neurology; Virtual reality; Critical functions; Epilepsy; General population; Head mounted displays; Immersive; Neurosurgical patients; Non-invasive imaging; Spatial memory; Patient rehabilitation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077928726

However, existing social VR experiences are mediated by inauthentic digital representations of the user (i.e., stylized avatars). These stylized representations have limited the adoption of social VR applications in precisely those cases where immersion is most necessary (e.g., professional interactions and intimate conversations). In this work, we present a bidirectional system that can animate avatar heads of both users’ full likeness using consumer-friendly headset mounted cameras (HMC). There are two main challenges in doing this: unaccommodating camera views and the image-to-avatar domain gap. We address both challenges by leveraging constraints imposed by multiview geometry to establish precise image-to-avatar correspondence, which are then used to learn an end-to-end model for real-time tracking. We present designs for a training HMC, aimed at data-collection and model building, and a tracking HMC for use during interactions in VR. Correspondence between the avatar and the HMC-acquired images are automatically found through self-supervised multiview image translation, which does not require manual annotation or one-to-one correspondence between domains.

CLICK is intended to provide an integrative learning experience by leveraging Virtual Reality (VR) technology to help provide a theme to connect and transfer the knowledge of engendering concepts. Integrative learning is described as the process of creating connections between concepts (i.e., skill and knowledge) from different resources and experiences, linking theory and practice, and using a variation of platforms to help students' understanding. In the CLICK approach, the integration is achieved by VR learning modules that serve as a platform for a common theme and include various challenges and exercises from multiple courses across the IE curriculum. Moreover, the modules will provide an immersive and realistic experience, which the authors hypothesize, will improve how the students relate what they learn in a classroom, to real-life experiences. The goals of the CLICK approach are to (i) provide the needed connection between courses and improve students' learning, and (ii) provide the needed linkage between theory and practice through a realistic representation of systems using VR. This work presents the results from an initial usability test performed on one of the VR modules. The results from the usability test indicate that participants liked the realism of the VR module. However, there are still some areas for improvement, and future work will focus on assessing the impact of the CLICK approach on students' learning, motivation, and preparation to be successful engineers, areas which could translate to a STEM pipeline for the future workforce. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Virtual reality; Integrated course; Integrative learning; Learning modules; Life experiences; Multiple course; New approaches; Theory and practice; Usability tests; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076433701

Directly contributing to the current project are two previous wind energy projects: “Wind Tech TV,” a 2010 NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) project that compiled a library of online training materials for wind turbine technician training, and “Mixed Reality Simulators for Wind Energy Education,” a U.S. Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) project that produced a series of simulators for wind energy educators and students to provide hands-on experiences and promote critical thinking. The new simulator is designed to teach troubleshooting and safety strategies, promote critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, and enhance the transfer of knowledge from classrooms to real-world situations. Learner immersion in a simulated environment and progression through numerous troubleshooting scenarios is expected to provide a better-prepared and more skilled workforce for the wind energy industry. Multiple community colleges, a wind energy company, two NSF ATE Centers, and a university research center comprise the multidisciplinary team working on this project. Community colleges are leading the curriculum and educational module design and implementation, industry collaborators are advising on needed skills and recommended activities, and the university research center is developing the software. Data from implementation in one community college so far show a 10% score increase for students using the simulator compared to traditional instruction alone. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Mixed reality; Simulators; Wind power; Wind turbines; Advanced Technological Education; Department of Education; Multi-disciplinary teams; Postsecondary education; Problem solving skills; Simulated environment; Traditional instruction; Transfer of knowledge; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078726658

Less effort has been put on the applications and services that will make use of and exploit the flexibility of 5G networks built upon the concept of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). Media-based applications are amongst the most demanding services, requiring large bandwidths for high audio-visual quality, low-latency for interactivity, and sufficient infrastructure resources to deliver the computational power for running the media applications in the networked cloud. This paper presents a novel service virtualization platform (SVP), called 5G-MEDIA SVP, which leverages the principles of NFV and SDN to facilitate the development, deployment, and operation of media services on 5G networks. The platform offers an advanced cognitive management environment for the provisioning of network services (NSs) and media-related applications, which directly link their lifecycle management with user experience as well as optimization of infrastructure resource utilization. Another innovation of 5G-MEDIA SVP is the integration of serverless computing with media intensive applications in 5G networks, increasing cost effectiveness of operation and simplifying development and deployment time. The proposed SVP is being validated against three media use cases: 1) immersive virtual reality 3-D gaming application; 2) remote production of broadcast content incorporating user generated contents; and 3) dynamically adaptive content distribution networks for the intelligent distribution of ultrahigh definition content. The preliminary results of the 5G-MEDIA SVP platform evaluation are compared against current practice and show that the proposed platform provides enhanced functionality for the operators and infrastructure owners, while ensuring better NS performance to service providers and end users. © 1963-12012 IEEE.","5G networks; content delivery networks; immersive media; network functions virtualization; remote production; serverless computing","Application programs; Bandwidth; Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Cost effectiveness; Distributed computer systems; Media streaming; Multimedia services; Network function virtualization; Queueing networks; Tools; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Content delivery network; G-networks; Immersive media; Media; Mobile communications; Network functions; serverless computing; Streaming media; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063366825

The purpose of this paper is to ascertain student views about the application of VR technology within their degree programmes from a pedagogical perspective in addition to identifying potential challenges to VR adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The research design adopted a mixed methods approach through the use of a questionnaire that was disseminated to undergraduate students studying in the discipline area of the creative industries. Through a series of open and closed questions, student views on VR adoption in higher education were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results were analysed statistically through a series of Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests. The qualitative statements were contextualised in the overall perspective of the research with the more relevant viewpoints identified to coincide with aspects of VR discovered in the literature. Findings: The predominant findings of the research indicated that the majority of the students considered the use of VR to have useful pedagogical implications though not all findings were positive. The findings provided a sound overview of the benefits and potential drawbacks of VR use in general with a more specific focus in an educational context. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the research include the lack of overall generalisations that can be formed from the study due to the sample size and the fact that the results were based from one specific academic institution. Practical implications: The findings of the research will provide educators with an insight into various perceptions of VR adoption within higher education. This will aid towards allowing them to reflect on whether VR is an appropriate tool to integrate within their curriculum and pedagogical approaches towards course delivery. Originality/value: Though several studies have explored the use of VR in multiple contexts and subject areas, there still needs to be more research towards its potential drawbacks in a teaching and learning scenario and how to resolve these issues. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Engagement; Higher education; Immersion; Presence; Virtual reality; VR technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064012439

Part of the challenge is the limited knowledge transfer between the healthcare, technology, the patients demands, and how these demands could be appropriately met. The current study addressed this challenge when exploring the potential of 360° immersive instruction videos in encouraging rehabilitation trials. A professional VR/ video maker studio created the video for the purpose of the current research. A rehabilitation therapist was recorded while performing rehabilitation exercise as it is done in the real life practice. Patients currently in various rehabilitation trials (motor vs. cardiovascular) were exposed to the 360° immersive instruction video. Their experience was compared with the control group, i.e. healthy people. The VR experience and the rehabilitation exercise experience were evaluated as measures of the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (VRR) impact. Results showed that 360° immersive videos engaged patients well, irrespective of the rehabilitation trial they are currently in. Regression modelling further demonstrated that the more people liked the VR experience, the more they enjoyed the rehabilitation activity. The more the rehabilitation activity was enjoyed, the more people were satisfied with the VRR. Current outcomes are discussed in the framework of a model of VRR impact, which is a solid base for long-term exercise adherence. The model could be implemented to successfully develop immersive instructional videos as efficient tools in the course of physical rehabilitation trials, and thus, to enhance health and well-being. © 2019 IEEE.","360 videos; Patients engagement; Virtual reality rehabilitation","Health care; Knowledge management; User interfaces; Virtual reality; 360 videos; Innovative technology; Instructional videos; Patients engagement; Physical rehabilitation; Regression modelling; Rehabilitation activities; Rehabilitation exercise; Patient rehabilitation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071832880

They are automatically rigged with facial blendshapes for animation, and can be used across platforms for applications including virtual reality, augmented reality, remote collaboration, gaming and more. From a set of input facial photos, our approach is to be able to create a photorealistic, fully rigged character in less than seven minutes. The facial mesh reconstruction is based on state-of-The art photogrammetry approaches. Automatic landmarking coupled with ICP registration with regularization provide direct correspondence and registration from a given generic mesh to the acquired facial mesh. Then, using deformation transfer, existing blendshapes are transferred from the generic to the reconstructed facial mesh. The reconstructed face is then fit to the full body generic mesh. Extra geometry such as jaws, teeth and nostrils are retargeted and transferred to the character. An automatic iris color extraction algorithm is performed to colorize a separate eye texture, animated with dynamic UVs. Finally, an extra step applies a style to the photorealis-tic face to enable blending of personalized facial features into any other character. The user's face can then be adapted to any human or non-human generic mesh. A pilot user study was performed to evaluate the utility of our approach. Up to 65% of the participants were successfully able to discern the presence of one's unique facial features when the style was not too far from a humanoid shape. © 2019 IEEE.","Animation; Character; Pipeline; Virtual reality","Animation; Augmented reality; Blending; Mesh generation; Pipelines; Textures; Virtual reality; Automatic Generation; Automatic landmarking; Character; Color extraction; Deformation transfer; Mesh reconstruction; Remote collaboration; Textural quality; User interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071882939

Later, these strings of extra information can help retrieve the learned content as demonstrated by experiments where contextual cues from an encoding situation facilitate remembering and improve memory performance when reinstated during retrieval. This context-dependent memory effect has been investigated over the course of several decades and has been demonstrated with many different types of contexts. Based on this, the widely held belief is that context-dependent memory is a strong and robust effect, with transferable substance for everyday learning and potential clinical applications. Here we report the results of a multi-study design investigating the influence of reinstated visual contexts on memory performance. Data from 120 participants were included in three studies comprising a variety of visual cues. We show convincingly that even rich, salient and fully surrounding visual contexts provided by virtual reality are not sufficient to induce effects of context-dependency in a free recall memory task. We also investigated contextual modulation of oscillatory brain activity in order to test the effect of reinstated neural contexts, which failed to evoke a robust effect when re-tested in an internal conceptual replication study. Moreover, a Bayesian sequential statistical analysis revealed moderate to strong evidence against the hypothesis that reinstatement of visual contexts benefits free recall memory tasks indicating that effects are small and may not be suitable for transfer into everyday learning. © 2019 Wälti et al.

In the present study, we used virtual reality to create a more life-like situation in order to study decision-making under controlled circumstances. In our experiment, participants trained in an immersive car simulation to complete a race-course as fast as possible. In the testing phase, pedestrians appeared on the course without warning, forcing participants to react. The experiment used a one-shot design to avoid pre-meditation and to test naïve, rapid decision-making. Participants' reactions could be classified into two categories: people who tried to brake, and people who potentially endangered pedestrians by not braking or conducting hazardous evasion maneuvers. Importantly, this latter group of participants scored significantly higher on psychopathy-related traits among a set of personality-related factors. Additional personality factors, as well as age, gender, gaming expertise, and driving experience did not significantly influence participants' decision-making. This result was true for both a Korean sample (N = 94) and an independently-tested German sample (N = 94), indicating cross-cultural stability of the results. Overall, our results demonstrate that decision-making in an extreme, simulated accident situation is critically influenced by personality traits. © 2019 Ju, Kang and Wallraven.","Accident situation; Decision-making; Driving; Personality; Psychopathy; Virtual reality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061043915

However, findings with this procedure often do not generalize to clinical settings. Virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool for improving the ecological and predictive validity of fear conditioning. The current study explored whether a classical differential cue conditioning paradigm with spider-fearful participants can be conducted in a VR-environment. Specifically, 25 spider-fearful and 25 non-fearful female students participated in a fear-conditioning experiment with a virtual spider as an unconditioned stimulus (US). The experiment took place in a virtual office in which participants viewed an avatar of themselves sitting at a desk. Conditioned stimuli (CS) were a blue (CS+; 100% reinforcement) and a green (CS-) light emitted by a desk lamp. Fear reactions were measured by fear ratings, skin conductance responses (SCR), and fear potentiated startle responses (FPS). Our results indicated stronger differential fear conditioning for spider-fearful participants than for non-fearful participants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these results relate specifically to spider-fear, and not to general trait anxiety. We conclude that fear conditioning in VR is a promising tool to improve the validity of classical fear conditioning procedures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Acquisition; Extinction; Fear conditioning; Spider-related fear; Virtual reality","Light extinction; Mobile computing; Acquisition; Clinical settings; Female students; Skin conductance response; Spider-related fear; Virtual office; Virtual reality; adult; anxiety; article; clinical article; controlled study; electrodermal response; fear conditioning test; female; human; nonhuman; reinforcement; spider; startle reflex; stimulus; student; validity; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056172525

Because of their portability and ubiquity, several studies have alluded to touchscreens as a potential platform for such access, yet there is still a gap in our understanding of multimodal information transfer in the context of graphics. The current research demonstrates feasibility for following lines, a fundamental graphical concept, via vibrations and sounds on commercial touchscreens. Two studies were run with 21 blind and visually impaired participants (N = 12; N = 9). The first study examined the presentation of straight, linear lines using a multitude of line representations, such as vibration-only, auditory-only, vibration lines with auditory borders, and auditory lines with vibration borders. The results of this study demonstrated that both auditory and vibratory bordered lines were optimal for precise tracing, although both vibration- and auditory-only lines were also sufficient for following, with minimal deviations. The second study examined the presentation of curving, non-linear lines. Conditions differed on the number of auditory reference points presented at the inflection and deflection points. Participants showed minimal deviation from the lines during tracing, performing nearly equally in both 1- and 3-point conditions. From these studies, we demonstrate that line following via multimodal feedback is possible on touchscreens, and we present guidelines for the presentation of such non-visual graphical concepts. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Haptics; HCI; Perception; Touchscreen","Human computer interaction; Sensory perception; Touch screens; Blind and visually impaired; Deflection points; Haptics; Multi-modal information; Multimodal feedback; Reference points; Textual information; Unsolved problems; Psychology computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062352386

Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of ""being there"" in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT® Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT® Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone (B = -5.70; p < 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI+VR DBT® Mindfulness skills (B = -4.38; p < 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts. © 2019 Navarro-Haro, Modrego-Alarcón, Hoffman, López-Montoyo, Navarro-Gil, Montero-Marin, García-Palacios, Borao and García-Campayo.","Dialectical behavior therapy; Generalized anxiety disorder; Mindfulness; Virtual reality; Virtual reality mindfulness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061030144

This paper aims to investigate the connection between listener sensitivity in vertical localization cues and experienced presence, spatial audio quality, and attention. Two VR experiments with head-mounted display (HMD) and animated visual avatar are proposed: (i) a screening test aiming to evaluate the participants' localization performance with HRTFs for a non-visible spatialized audio source, and (ii) a 2 minute free exploration of a VR scene with five audiovisual sources in a both non-spatialized (2D stereo panning) and spatialized (free-field HRTF rendering) listening conditions. The screening test allows a distinction between good and bad localizers. The second one shows that no biases are introduced in the quality of the experience (QoE) due to different audio rendering methods; more interestingly, good localizers perceive a lower audio latency and they are less involved in the visual aspects. © 2018 IEEE.","Auditory feedback; Human-centered computing; Interaction devices; Interaction paradigms; Interaction techniques; Sound-based input / output Human-centered computing; Virtual reality; Human-centered computing","Augmented reality; Helmet mounted displays; Three dimensional computer graphics; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Auditory feedback; Human-centered computing; Input/output; Interaction devices; Interaction paradigm; Interaction techniques; Sound reproduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062179431

Brain extraction is an initial step for subsequent analyses, but most of the existing methods so far are designed for human brain, which does not work well with the rhesus macaque. Firstly, we propose a reliable and efficient method to extract the brain from magnetic resonance imaging data sets based on dividing the brain into blocks. Then, we design a trapezoid opacity transfer function based on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)-based real-time volume ray casting, which is dedicated to volume rendering to make the inspection more intuitive.

The exercise offers a visual example of narrative sense of place and serves as a guide for the students’ writing. As personal narratives often suffer from a lack of sensory details, a visual reminder can help these writers reflect on how to immerse their readers. For students to fully grasp the purpose of the exercise, metacognitive practices are used to prepare them. Meta-strategic knowledge (MSK) makes students aware of what to look for in the VR game before they play it. I present an argument for the transfer of the skill of identifying the importance of sense of place to student writing through the familiar practice of playing games and the use of MSK.

These interactions are investigated by simulating heat and mass transfer, thus, reducing a need for costly and time demanding subject studies. However, it is not clear, from the available literature, what portion of the body surface area is actually affected by the seat with respect to human anthropometry. The aim of this study was to develop a predicting function of the seat contact area based on anthropometric parameters. The results showed strong linear correlation between the contact area obtained by printing a body silhouette on paper placed at the seat and body weight, height, body surface area, and body mass index.

Inflammatory response and direct contact with abundant proteins after implantation lead to corrosion issues of biomedical stainless steels. The effect of combination of H2O2 and albumin on the corrosion of 316L stainless steel has been investigated for the first time in simulated body fluids at 37 °C with electrochemical and long term immersion tests. ICP-MS measurement after 16 weeks immersion reveals that the total concentration in the presence of both species was substantially higher than physiological saline alone, and even higher than the sum of H2O2 alone and albumin alone. Electrochemical polarisation curves and electrochemical impendence spectra show that albumin accelerated anodic dissolution and suppressed cathodic reaction, while H2O2 promoted cathodic reaction. Also, H2O2 and/or albumin promoted meta-stable/stable pitting corrosion and decreased charge transfer resistance. Accelerated corrosion of 316L stainless steel in the presence of both species was attributed to the promoted formation of Fe oxides and CrOOH by H2O2 and the largely favoured dissolution of these oxides by the addition of albumin, significantly accelerating Fe and Cr release. The synergistic interaction between both species indicates significant underestimation of corrosion rate evaluated solely in physiological saline. These findings suggest the necessity of using more realistic solutions to evaluate corrosion resistance of biomedical alloys for future in-vitro studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Albumin; Corrosion; H2O2; Implant; Stainless steel","Austenitic stainless steel; Body fluids; Charge transfer; Corrosion; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Dissolution; Implants (surgical); Iron oxides; Metal implants; Physiology; Pitting; Sodium chloride; Stainless steel; Accelerated corrosion; Albumin; Charge transfer resistance; Electrochemical polarisation; H2O2; Inflammatory response; Simulated body fluids; Synergistic interaction; Steel corrosion; albuminoid; chromium; hydrogen peroxide; iron; stainless steel; body fluid; chemistry; corrosion; impedance spectroscopy; materials testing; metabolism; Albumins; Body Fluids; Chromium; Corrosion; Dielectric Spectroscopy; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Materials Testing; Stainless Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048719001

Streaming service providers such as YouTube need a perceptually relevant objective audio quality metric to monitor users' perceived quality and spatial localization accuracy. In this paper we introduce a full reference objective spatial audio quality metric, AMBIQUAL, which assesses both Listening Quality and Localization Accuracy. In our solution both metrics are derived directly from the B-format Ambisonic audio. The metric extends and adapts the algorithm used in ViSQOLAudio, a full reference objective metric designed for assessing speech and audio quality. In particular, Listening Quality is derived from the omnidirectional channel and Localization Accuracy is derived from a weighted sum of similarity from B-format directional channels. This paper evaluates whether the proposed AMBIQUAL objective spatial audio quality metric can predict two factors: Listening Quality and Localization Accuracy by comparing its predictions with results from MUSHRA subjective listening tests. In particular, we evaluated the Listening Quality and Localization Accuracy of First and Third-Order Ambisonic audio compressed with the OPUS 1.2 codec at various bitrates (i.e. 32, 128 and 256, 512kbps respectively). The sample set for the tests comprised both recorded and synthetic audio clips with a wide range of time-frequency characteristics. To evaluate Localization Accuracy of compressed audio a number of fixed and dynamic (moving vertically and horizontally) source positions were selected for the test samples. Results showed a strong correlation (PCC=0.919; Spearman=0.882 regarding Listening Quality and PCC=0.854; Spearman=0.842 regarding Localization Accuracy) between objective quality scores derived from the B-format Ambisonic audio using AMBIQUAL and subjective scores obtained during listening MUSHRA tests. AMBIQUAL displays very promising quality assessment predictions for spatial audio. Future work will optimise the algorithm to generalise and validate it for any Higher Order Ambisonic formats. © 2018 IEEE.","ambisonics; audio coding; audio compression; MUSHRA; opus codec; spatial audio; virtual reality",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054367108

For this reason, mammalian brains host another type of cells called “glial cells”, whose role is to maintain proper conditions for efficient neuronal function. One type of glial cell, astrocytes, are involved in particular in the metabolic support of neurons, by feeding them with lactate, one byproduct of glucose metabolism that they can take up from blood vessels, and store it under another form, glycogen granules. These energy-storage molecules, whose morphology resembles to spheres with a diameter ranging 10–80 nanometers roughly, can be easily recognized using electron microscopy, the only technique whose resolution is high enough to resolve them. Understanding and quantifying their distribution is of particular relevance for neuroscientists, in order to understand where and when neurons use energy under this form. To answer this question, we developed a visualization technique, dubbed GLAM (Glycogen-derived Lactate Absorption Map), and customized for the analysis of the interaction of astrocytic glycogen on surrounding neurites in order to formulate hypotheses on the energy absorption mechanisms. The method integrates high-resolution surface reconstruction of neurites, astrocytes, and the energy sources in form of glycogen granules from different automated serial electron microscopy methods, like focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) or serial block face electron microscopy (SBEM), together with an absorption map computed as a radiance transfer mechanism. The resulting visual representation provides an immediate and comprehensible illustration of the areas in which the probability of lactate shuttling is higher. The computed dataset can be then explored and quantified in a 3D space, either using 3D modeling software or virtual reality environments. Domain scientists have evaluated the technique by either using the computed maps for formulating functional hypotheses or for planning sparse reconstructions to avoid excessive occlusion. Furthermore, we conducted a pioneering user study showing that immersive VR setups can ease the investigation of the areas of interest and the analysis of the absorption patterns in the cellular structures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D interactive visual analysis; Nanometric scale brain reconstructions; Neuroenergetics; Scientific visualization; Virtual Reality in Neuroscience","Blood vessels; Data visualization; Electrons; Granulation; Ion beams; Mammals; Metabolism; Neurons; Repair; Scanning electron microscopy; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Visualization; Brain reconstruction; Energy-storage molecule; Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopies; Interactive visual analysis; Neuroenergetics; Virtual-reality environment; Visual representations; Visualization technique; Surface reconstruction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047628319

In parallel, we developed a small Y-maze with interchangeable end-boxes, which allowed replacing repeatedly a freely walking bee into the starting point of the maze for repeated decision recording. Using conditioning and transfer experiments between the VR setup and the Y-maze, we studied the extent to which movement freedom and active vision are crucial for learning a simple color discrimination. Approximately 57% of the bees learned the visual discrimination in both conditions. Transfer from VR to the maze improved significantly the bees’ performances: 75% of bees having chosen the CS+ continued doing so and 100% of bees having chosen the CS- reverted their choice in favor of the CS+. In contrast, no improvement was seen for these two groups of bees during the reciprocal transfer from the Y-maze to VR. In this case, bees exhibited inconsistent choices in the VR setup. The asymmetric transfer between contexts indicates that the information learned in each environment may be different despite the similar learning success. Moreover, it shows that reducing the possibility of active vision and movement freedom in the passage from the maze to the VR impairs the expression of visual learning while increasing them in the reciprocal transfer improves it. Our results underline the active nature of visual processing in bees and allow discussing the developments required for immersive VR experiences in insects. © 2018 Buatois, Flumian, Schultheiss, Avarguès-Weber and Giurfa.","Honey bees; Insect cognition; Transfer of learning; Virtual reality; Visual conditioning; Y-maze","animal experiment; Article; color discrimination; discrimination learning; honeybee; learning; mental performance; nonhuman; simulation training; transfer of learning; virtual learning; virtual reality; vision; visual discrimination; visual discrimination learning test; visual learning; Y-maze test",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053289877

Our system aids the language learning process through task-completion exercises using multi-modal dialogue. The Cognitive and Immersive Room (CIR) is developed as an immersive Chinese restaurant to teach Mandarin, but the interaction challenges and solutions can be reasonably generalized to other languages taught using similar techniques. As users interact with the immersive environment and the virtual AI agent, they face several user interaction challenges. These challenges arise from new learners' lack of proficiency in the foreign language. By studying user interactions in the CIR, we were able to articulate some of the interaction challenges. We have enhanced the AI agent, virtual environment, and the on-boarding process for new users to mitigate these challenges.

Immersive virtual reality (VR) laparoscopy simulation connects VR simulation with head-mounted displays to increase presence during VR training. The goal of the present study was the comparison of 2 different surroundings according to performance and users’ preference. Methods. With a custom immersive virtual reality laparoscopy simulator, an artificially created VR operating room (AVR) and a highly immersive VR operating room (IVR) were compared. Participants (n = 30) performed 3 tasks (peg transfer, fine dissection, and cholecystectomy) in AVR and IVR in a crossover study design. Results. No overall difference in virtual laparoscopic performance was obtained when comparing results from AVR with IVR. Most participants preferred the IVR surrounding (n = 24). Experienced participants (n = 10) performed significantly better than novices (n = 10) in all tasks regardless of the surrounding (P <.05). Participants with limited experience (n = 10) showed differing results. Presence, immersion, and exhilaration were significantly higher in IVR. Two thirds assumed that IVR would have a positive influence on their laparoscopic simulator use. Conclusion.

Our framework enhances the efficiency of collaborations arising in design, simulation or data analysis, including visualization. First, we investigate which requirements on such a collaboration framework exist and which influences between task models have to be taken into account; afterwards we transfer those findings into a prototypical system. The devices provide three views of data to be processed collaboratively: (1) a simulation view; (2) a status report view; and (3) a status update view. These views serve the purpose of providing overview, detail and performance views. A smart watch view shows at-a-glance information, the environment or the process being inspected, possibly influenced by a user. Users can use their mobile devices as control interfaces. The framework is especially effective for combining the synergistic, complementary competencies of a team.

Location-based augmented reality games posit interesting questions regarding GTP, particularly because they use physical locations, they overlay digital images in physical contexts and the gameplay shifts between the virtual and the physical world. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of GTP and the role of immersion, augmented reality and sound in a sample of English- (EnS) and Spanish- (SpS) speaking gamers of the game Pokémon Go (PoGo). A total of 1313 gamers (Mage = 31.47) were recruited online. GTP was less common than in previous studies; however, 82.4% had experienced GTP at least once. The SpS showed higher prevalence of GTP and played more intensively. Automatic mental processes predominated in the EnS, while behaviours and actions were more common in the SpS. The absence or presence of video game features seems important for the way GTP manifests. For instance, tactile hallucinations were more prevalent, while sensations of self-motion were less reported. Playing with augmented reality (AR) and sounds showed significant correlations with various GTP types, but not with re-experiencing images from the game. More gamers who reported the sensation that Pokémon were physically present or looked for Pokémon outside the screen while playing, as connotations of immersion, had experienced GTP. Experiencing GTP while playing may be more common in location-based augmented reality games, compared to other games. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auditory cues; Augmented reality games; Game Transfer Phenomena; Immersion; Location-based games; Pokémon Go","Augmented reality; Interactive computer graphics; Location; Auditory cues; Empirical studies; Immersion; Location based games; Physical locations; Physical objects; Tactile sensation; Transfer phenomenon; Human computer interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039748060

In this paper, we present a study that compares the effectiveness of virtual training and physical training for teaching a bimanual assembly task. In a between-subjects experiment, 60 participants were trained to solve three 3D burr puzzles in one of six conditions comprised of virtual and physical training elements. In the four physical conditions, training was delivered via paper-And video-based instructions, with or without the physical puzzles to practice with. In the two virtual conditions, participants learnt to assemble the puzzles in an interactive virtual environment, with or without 3D animations showing the assembly process. After training, we conducted immediate tests in which participants were asked to solve a physical version of the puzzles. We measured performance through success rates and assembly completion testing times. We also measured training times as well as subjective ratings on several aspects of the experience. Our results show that the performance of virtually trained participants was promising. A statistically significant difference was not found between virtual training with animated instructions and the best performing physical condition (in which physical blocks were available during training) for the last and most complex puzzle in terms of success rates and testing times. Performance in retention tests two weeks after training was generally not as good as expected for all experimental conditions. We discuss the implications of the results and highlight the validity of virtual reality systems in training. © 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

Preliminary studies suggest that minimal dosage of gaze stability exercises improves postural stability in young adults with chronic motion sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of progressive gaze stability exercises on postural stability, motion sensitivity, and anxiety in healthy young adults with chronic motion sensitivity. Methods: We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of gaze stability exercises on chronic motion sensitivity. Forty-one participants of both genders ages 20 to 40 years with chronic motion sensitivity were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The intervention group performed gaze stability exercises while the sham group performed saccadic eye movement exercises for 6 weeks. Computerized Dynamic Posturography with Immersion Virtual Reality (CDP-IVR)-condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2)-Motion Sensitivity Quotient (MSQ), Motion Sickness Sensitivity Susceptibility Questionnaire Short Form (MSSQ-Short: MSA, MSB), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI Form Y-2) were the outcome measures used. Results: There was no significant group × time interaction for MSA, MSB, MSSQ percentile, STAI, MSQ, C1 mean, or C2 mean. However, posttreatment a significant difference in the mean CDP-IVR score of C2 was identified between the 2 groups. For C2, the intervention group demonstrated a 117% increase in the mean CDP-IVR score compared with a 35.2% increase in the sham group. MSQ reduced significantly from baseline to 6 weeks postintervention in the intervention group (4.0 ± 1.2 vs 1.9 ± 0.9). Anxiety was significantly reduced in the sham group only (38.2 ± 1.9 vs 35.8 ± 2.2). Discussion and Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, progressive gaze stability exercises appear to have value for managing chronic motion sensitivity in healthy young adults. Further research with larger sample size and broader age range is needed to generalize these findings.

Thus, should neuropsychological therapy be designed as real-life-like as possible to maximize transfer effects? We investigated whether ecological validity of computerized cognitive training could be increased by a comprehensive everyday-life-simulating training device combining virtual reality, 360°-all-around visibility and autonomous navigation motions. In an eight days training program, patients exercised the learning and purchasing of shopping list products in a virtual supermarket using either the novel training device (n = 21) or a corresponding desktop application (n = 17). In a pre-post-design, effects of the two training conditions were compared regarding several outcome measures. Altogether, results did not prove a benefit of the more naturalistic training setting regarding different training performances (recognition, performance speed, spatial orientation), self-perceived daily cognitive impairments, a real-life shopping task as well as various neuropsychological capabilities.

However, evidence of neuroplasticity notwithstanding, there are few scientifically rigorous, ecologically relevant brain training studies focused on building cognitive reserve in middle age to protect against cognitive decline. This pilot study will examine the ability of virtual reality (VR) cognitive training to improve cognition and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in middle-aged individuals at high AD risk due to parental history. Methods: The design is an assessor-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial of VR cognitive-motor training in middle-aged adults with AD family history. The experimental group will be trained with adaptive “real-world” VR tasks targeting sustained and selective attention, working memory, covert rule deduction, and planning, while walking on a treadmill. One active control group will perform the VR tasks without treadmill walking; another will walk on a treadmill while watching scientific documentaries (nonspecific cognitive stimulation). A passive (waitlist) control group will not receive training. Training sessions will be 45 minutes, twice/week for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes are global cognition and CBF (from arterial spin labeling [ASL]) at baseline, immediately after training (training gain), and 3 months post-training (maintenance gain). We aim to recruit 125 participants, including 20 passive controls and 35 in the other groups. Discussion: Current pharmacologic therapies are for symptomatic AD patients, whereas nonpharmacologic training is administrable before symptom onset. Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive training improves cognitive function. However, a more ecologically valid cognitive-motor VR setting that better mimics complex daily activities may augment transfer of trained skills. VR training has benefited clinical cohorts, but benefit in asymptomatic high-risk individuals is unknown. If effective, this trial may help define a prophylactic regimen for AD, adaptable for home-based application in high-risk individuals. © 2018 The Authors","Alzheimer's disease; Arterial spin labeling; Cerebral blood flow; Cognition; Cognitive training; MRI; Neuroplasticity; Prevention; Virtual reality","adult; age; Alzheimer disease; arterial spin labeling; Article; brain blood flow; cognition; cognitive reserve; controlled study; daily life activity; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; middle aged; motor performance; nerve cell plasticity; nerve degeneration; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; selective attention; software design; training; transfer of learning; virtual reality; walking; working memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045377385

The potential of BIM methodology to support a transformation of the processes of design and construction has been evident in the construction industry. A current topic that requires attention is the integration of BIM with Virtual Reality (VR) where the user visualizes a virtual world through interactive devices or a total immersion. VR combines several devices for interaction, creating virtual environment, and this must followed by studies concerning how to use devices or how to establish links for the presentation of information contained in a BIM model. By adding VR, the BIM solution can address retrieving and presenting information and increasing efficiency on communication and problem solving in an interactive and collaborative project. BIM + VR allow two main capacities: walkthrough and consulting data, and currently BIM tools allow links to VR plugins in order to achieve both capacities. As such, it is expected to be further explored in the near future. The text presents a review of actual perspective of the VR use applied over 3D/BIM models to supports multi-dimensional BIM applications, namely, 4D/BIM and 7D/BIM models. The objective of the study is to report the improvement of BIM uses with the addition of interactive capacities allowed by VR technology.

Inspired by the design of magic powers in popular culture, Force Push uses intuitive hand gestures to drive physics-based movement of the object. Using a novel algorithm that dynamically maps rich features of hand gestures to the properties of the physics simulation, both coarse-grained ballistic movements and fine-grained refinement movements can be achieved seamlessly and naturally. An initial user study of a limited translation task showed that, although its gesture-to-force mapping is inherently harder to control than traditional position-to-position mappings, Force Push is usable even for extremely difficult tasks. Direct position-to-position control outperformed Force Push when the initial distance between the object and the target was close relative to the required accuracy; however, the gesture-based method began to show promising results when they were far away from each other. As for subjective user experience, Force Push was perceived as more natural and fun to use, even though its controllability and accuracy were thought to be inferior to direct control. This paper expands the design space of object manipulation beyond mimicking reality, and provides hints on using magical gestures and physics-based techniques for higher usability and hedonic qualities in user experience. © 2018 Yu and Bowman.","Controllability; Hand gesture; Object manipulation; Physics-based manipulation; Transfer function; Virtual reality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062438355

The REVEAL software framework facilitates the development of Educational Environmental Narrative (EEN) games in virtual reality for the PlayStation 4. The framework is composed of a set of software layers and editor plugins which augment an existing game engine technology (""The PhyreEngine"") and facilitate its transfer to educational applications. The PhyreEngine was created by Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe and is free and open source to registered PlayStation developers, including academic partners under the PlayStation First scheme. The REVEAL framework is built on top of the PhyreEngine and will be made similarly available to PlayStation developers through Sony Interactive Entertainment's developer network. This paper describes the functionality and design of the REVEAL framework, including its graph-based architecture, node-based locomotion system and high-resolution paper artefact rendering system. Key supporting tools are also described, including the Story Scaffolding Tool and its role in collecting detailed game analytics. The application of the framework is illustrated through an EEN case study application based on the life of Dr. Edward Jenner: the 18th century scientist credited with the discovery of vaccination.

VREX is based on Virtual Reality (VR) and we believe VR can revolutionize the education ecosystem. With some trials, we found VR can be used to promote curriculum effectiveness in an immersive environment so that students can have intuitive sense to understand some abstract knowledge, which is always hard for teachers to describe. We have tried to transfer slides into VR scenes, for the students to learn knowledge in a rather real but totally virtual world. The main contributions were made: (1) VREX build an open and immersion virtual O2O classroom with internet and VR devices so that real classrooms might be used in a different way in the future. (2) VREX provides a distributed mode for students to experience an interactive learning process at anytime, anywhere and any-frequency. (3) VREX can be used to support education in different disciplines, from K-12 to Universities, and we provided some practical cases, like 'Marine Life' to show creatures in deep sea, which provides immersive experience to makes students feel they were there. Finally, the feasibility and advantage of VREX are proved by the actual statistical data in the 3rd season 2017. © 2017 IEEE.","Immersion; Interaction; Virtual classroom; Virtual reality; VR cloud platform","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Learning systems; Marine education; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Cloud platforms; Curriculum buildings; Immersion; Immersive environment; Innovative education; Interaction; Interactive learning; Virtual Classroom; E-learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043232821

Motion sickness and individual psychological changes have been associated with VR. The goal was to observe first experiences and performance scores using a new combined highly immersive virtual reality (IVR) laparoscopy setup. Methods: During the study, 10 members of the surgical department performed three tasks (fine dissection, peg transfer, and cholecystectomy) on a VR simulator. We then combined a VR HMD with the VR laparoscopic simulator and displayed the simulation on a 360° video of a laparoscopic operation to create an IVR laparoscopic simulation. The tasks were then repeated. Validated questionnaires on immersion and motion sickness were used for the study. Results: Participants’ times for fine dissection were significantly longer during the IVR session (regular: 86.51 s [62.57 s; 119.62 s] vs. IVR: 112.35 s [82.08 s; 179.40 s]; p = 0.022). The cholecystectomy task had higher error rates during IVR. Motion sickness did not occur at any time for any participant. Participants experienced a high level of exhilaration, rarely thought about others in the room, and had a high impression of presence in the generated IVR world. Conclusion: This is the first clinical and technical feasibility study using the full IVR laparoscopy setup combined with the latest laparoscopic simulator in a 360° surrounding. Participants were exhilarated by the high level of immersion. The setup enables a completely new generation of surgical training. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Abdominal surgery; Immersive virtual reality; Laparoscopy; Simulation; Training; Virtual surgery","abdominal surgery; Article; cholecystectomy; dissection; feasibility study; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; motion sickness; operating room personnel; priority journal; surgical training; time; virtual reality; clinical competence; education; health care personnel; laparoscopy; procedures; questionnaire; simulation training; statistics and numerical data; Clinical Competence; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Simulation Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017182338

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our Pharmacology Inter-Leaved Learning Virtual Reality (PILL-VR) simulation when applied to nursing education, as a tool for learning medication administration procedures. A quasi-experimental pretest-intervention-posttest comparison group design was conducted based on quantitative analysis of questionnaires, video recordings and worksheets. Participants were nursing students who either learned medication administration processes with a PILL-VR simulation platform (experimental group; n = 82) or who learned with lecture-based curriculum (n = 47; comparison group). The results revealed significantly higher conceptual and procedural knowledge learning gains following activity with the PILL-VR simulation compared to studying via lecture-based curriculum. PILL-VR exposed the students to their own errors, allowing procedure rehearsal followed by constant feedback which is essential to skill acquisition. Although PILL-VR is based on a desktop system, it facilitated a strong sense of presence. A small positive correlation was found on questionnaire scores between the sense of presence, particularly the sense of control, and conceptual-procedural learning of medication administration. This indicates that by improving students' sense of control in the PILL-VR, the learning process can be improved. Hence, VR simulations may provide affordable and flexible access to practice necessary practical skills in higher education, which is crucial to developing students’ expertise. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Higher education; Nursing education; Simulation; Virtual reality","Curricula; E-learning; Learning systems; Nursing; Surveys; Technology transfer; Video recording; Virtual reality; Analysis of questionnaire; Desktop virtual reality; Higher education; Nursing education; Positive correlations; Procedural knowledge; Procedural learning; Simulation; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019934867

The objectives were to evaluate the learning outcomes of an immersive simulation boot-camp for incoming residents before starting the clinical rotations. Airway assessment, airway control with direct laryngoscopy, and epidural catheterization competencies were evaluated. Material and method Twelve first-year anaesthesiology residents participated. A prospective study to evaluate transfer of endotracheal intubation skills learned at the simulation centre to clinical practice (primary outcome) was conducted. A checklist of 28 skills and behaviours was used to assess the first supervised intubation performed during anaesthesia induction in ASA I/II patients. Secondary outcome was self-efficacy to perform epidural catheterization. A satisfaction survey was also performed. Results Seventy-five percent of residents completed more than 21 out of 28 skills and behaviours to assess and control the airway during their first intubation in patients. Twelve items were performed by all residents and 5 by half of them. More than 83% of participants reported a high level of self-efficacy in placing an epidural catheter. All participants would recommend the course to their colleagues. Conclusions A focused intensive simulation-based boot-camp addressing key competencies required to begin anaesthesia residency was well received, and led to transfer of airway management skills learned to clinical settings when performing for first time on patients, and to increased self-reported efficacy in performing epidural catheterization. © 2017 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor","Epidural anaesthesia; Intratracheal intubation; Learning; Patient simulation; Self-efficacy; Simulation training","anesthesiology; consumer attitude; curriculum; education; evaluation study; human; learning curve; medical education; prospective study; respiration control; self concept; simulation training; Airway Management; Anesthesiology; Consumer Behavior; Curriculum; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internship and Residency; Learning Curve; Prospective Studies; Self Efficacy; Simulation Training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016051441

Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning. We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character. We confirm this hypothesis for a category of learning (Remember and Understand) and give insights on students' relationships with their character. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Character appearance; Character customization; Pedagogical agent; Virtual character","Students; Virtual reality; Character appearance; Character customization; Computational thinkings; Educational Applications; Interactive applications; Pedagogical agents; Programming concepts; Virtual character; Education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030788272

ABI patients usually stop receiving cognitive treatment when leaving the rehabilitation facility or shortly thereafter, due to the high cost of therapy sessions and the mobility requirement to access therapy. Software solutions offer a promising tool for accessible and affordable cognitive rehabilitation in the home environment. However, research provides limited evidence for effective transfer of benefits from computerized cognitive training to real-life functions. Virtual reality (VR) exergames using motion-interaction offer a more realistic and natural training environment, and are therefore expected to facilitate a more effective transfer. Although commercial exergames may bring about some cognitive gains, they usually do not target cognitive functions directly. Here we describe a novel exergames platform, the Active Brain Trainer (ABT), designed to directly target EF, using games in multiple realistic contexts. The software adapts in real-time to the patient's behavior, providing feedback and rewards, and hence may enhance usability and compliance. The primary goal of the current study is to assess the feasibly and acceptability of this platform for community-dwelling ABI patients during the chronic phase. A secondary goal is to assess the initial efficacy on EF and functional benefits from program training. Participants were instructed to use the games for 15-20 sessions. Neuropsychological assessments of EF and daily life functions were performed before and after training. Participants also filled a satisfaction questionnaire following training. All training and assessments were conducted in the participants' homes. Game performance was recorded throughout training sessions. Preliminary results from the six ABI patients who successfully completed the program so far show no adverse effects. Participants reported enjoyment and satisfaction from training. Participants performed increasingly more challenging EF tasks within game environments. Initial results show improvements in functional tasks and most executive neuropsychological assessments following training. Additional participants are currently being trained to increase the power of the results. These preliminary findings support the feasibility and potential efficacy of the motion-based cognitive training of EF for community-dwelling individuals with ABI. © 2017 IEEE.","acquired brain injury; Cognitive training; community-dwelling; executive functions; exergames; motion-based","Buildings; E-learning; Housing; Patient treatment; Virtual reality; Acquired brain injuries; Cognitive training; community-dwelling; Executive function; Exergames; motion-based; Patient rehabilitation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034269195

In some situations, such as when using systems that lack a fully surrounding display or when opting for convenient low-effort interaction, view control can be enabled through a combination of physical and virtual turns to view the environment, but the reduced realism could potentially interfere with the ability to maintain spatial orientation. One solution to this problem is to amplify head rotations such that smaller physical turns are mapped to larger virtual turns, allowing trainees to view the entire surrounding environment with small head movements. This solution is attractive because it allows semi-natural physical view control rather than requiring complete physical rotations or a fully-surrounding display. However, the effects of amplified head rotations on spatial orientation and many practical tasks are not well understood. In this paper, we present an experiment that evaluates the influence of amplified head rotation on 3D search, spatial orientation, and cybersickness. In the study, we varied the amount of amplification and also varied the type of display used (head-mounted display or surround-screen CAVE) for the VR search task. By evaluating participants first with amplification and then without, we were also able to study training transfer effects. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of using amplified head rotation to view 360 degrees of virtual space, but noticeable problems were identified when using high amplification with a head-mounted display. In addition, participants were able to more easily maintain a sense of spatial orientation when using the CAVE version of the application, which suggests that visibility of the user's body and awareness of the CAVE's physical environment may have contributed to the ability to use the amplification technique while keeping track of orientation. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","3D interaction; cybersickness; Rotation amplification; Search; Spatial orientation; Virtual reality","Caves; E-learning; Helmet mounted displays; Virtual reality; 3D interactions; Amplification technique; Cybersickness; Head mounted displays; Physical environments; Search; Spatial orientations; Surrounding environment; Rotation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028407406

The reasons people tell stories are manifold: to entertain, to transfer knowledge between generations, to maintain cultural heritage, or to warn others of dangers. With the emergence of the digitisation of media, many new possibilities to tell stories in serious and non-entertainment contexts emerged. A very simple example is the idea of serious gaming, as in, digital games without the primary purpose of entertainment. In this paper, we introduce the term serious storytelling as a new potential media genre – defining serious storytelling as storytelling with a purpose beyond entertainment. We also put forward a review of existing potential application areas, and develop a framework for serious storytelling. We foresee several application areas for this fundamental concept, including wellbeing and health, medicine, psychology, education, ethical problem solving, e-leadership and management, qualitative journalism, serious digital games, simulations and virtual training, user experience studies, and online communication. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ambient media; Design science; Digital interactive media; Digital narratives; E-health; E-leadership; E-learning; Education; Forensics; Human-computer interaction; Journalism; Persuasive messages; Serious games; Serious storytelling; Smart media; Storytelling, digital storytelling; Ubiquitous computation; Ubiqutious media; User-experience; Virtual reality","Computer games; Design; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Problem solving; Virtual reality; Ambient media; Design science; Digital narratives; Digital storytelling; E health; Forensics; Interactive media; Journalism; Persuasive messages; Serious games; Serious storytelling; Smart media; Ubiquitous computation; Ubiqutious media; User experience; Human computer interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984903771

This paper mainly designs a lateral control dynamic model of the intelligent vehicle, which is used for lateral tracking control. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model (i.e., transfer function) is established according to the vehicle parameters. Secondly, according to the vehicle steering control system and the CARMA (Controlled Auto-Regression and Moving-Average) model, a second-order control system model is built. Using forgetting factor recursive least square estimation (FFRLS), the system parameters are identified. Finally, a neural network PID (Proportion Integral Derivative) controller is established for lateral path tracking control based on the vehicle model and the steering system model. Experimental simulation results show that the proposed model and algorithm have the high real-time and robustness in path tracing control. This provides a certain theoretical basis for intelligent vehicle autonomous navigation tracking control, and lays the foundation for the vertical and lateral coupling control. © 2017 by the authors.

To accomplish this, we generalize the two-dimensional parallel-coordinates statistical graphic as an immersive «parallel-planes» visualization for multivariate time series emitted by simulations running in parallel with the visualization. In contrast to traditional parallel coordinate's mapping the multivariate dimensions onto coordinate axes represented by a series of parallel lines, we map pairs of the multivariate dimensions onto a series of parallel rectangles. As in the case of parallel coordinates, each individual observation in the dataset is mapped to a polyline whose vertices coincide with its coordinate values. Regions of the rectangles can be «brushed» to highlight and select observations of interest: A «slider» control allows the user to filter the observations by their time coordinate. In an immersive virtual environment, users interact with the parallel planes using a joystick that can select regions on the planes, manipulate selection, and filter time. The brushing and selection actions are used to both explore existing data as well as to launch additional simulations corresponding to the visually selected portions of the input parameter space. As soon as the new simulations complete, their resulting observations are displayed in the virtual environment. This tight feedback loop between simulation and immersive analytics accelerates users' realization of insights about the simulation and its output. © 2016 IEEE.","I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism-Virtual reality","Computer aided software engineering; Computer graphics; Data visualization; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; High-dimensional; I.3.7 [computer graphics]: three-dimensional graphics and realism - virtual realities; Immersive virtual environments; Multivariate time series; Parallel coordinates; Simulation systems; Statistical graphics; Time coordinates; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025675994

Participants were asked to learn the location of a virtual object in a virtual environment (VE). After a short period of time they were asked to recall the location by placing a real version of the object in the real-world equivalent environment. Results indicate that the average placement error, or distance between original and recalled object location, is approximately 20cm for all locomotion technique conditions. This result is similar to the outcome of a previous study on spatial memory in VEs that used real walking.

Simulation has been purported to be an effective tool in assisting with this. The aim of this systematic review is to identify the available otolaryngology simulators, their status of validation, and evaluation the level of evidence behind each training model and thereby establish a level of recommendation. Design PubMed, ERIC, and Google Scholar databases were searched for articles that described otolaryngology simulators or training models between 1980 and April 2016. Any validation studies for simulators were also retrieved. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Level of evidence (LoE) and Level of recommendation (LoR) was awarded to each study and model, respectively. Results A total of 70 studies were identified describing 64 simulators. Out of these, at least 54 simulators had 1 validation study. Simulators for the ear and temporal bone surgery were the most common (n = 32), followed by laryngeal and throat (n = 20) and endoscopic sinus surgery (n = 12). Face validity was evaluated by 29 studies, 20 attempted to show construct, 20 assessed content, 20 transfer, and only 2 assessed concurrent validity. Of the validation assessments, 2 were classified as Level 1b, 10 Level 2a, and 48 Level 2b. No simulators received the highest LoR, but 8 simulators received a LoR of 2. Conclusions Despite the lack of evidence in outcome studies and limited number of high-validity otolaryngology simulators, the role of simulation continues to grow across surgical specialties Hence, it is imperative that the simulators are of high validity and construct for trainees to practice and rehearse surgical skills to develop confidence. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","ENT; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; otolaryngology; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; simulation; systematic review; training; validation","Article; clinical evaluation; concurrent validity; endoscopic sinus surgery; evidence based practice; face validity; human; larynx surgery; mastoidectomy; Medline; meta analysis (topic); middle ear surgery; myringotomy; nonhuman; otorhinolaryngology; outcome assessment; practice guideline; priority journal; simulation training; skill; systematic review; throat surgery; tympanostomy tube; validation study; clinical competence; computer simulation; education; female; male; medical education; otorhinolaryngology; procedures; reproducibility; simulation training; United Kingdom; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Otolaryngology; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006293395

To the student, this kind of technology often has abstract behaviours where the only information/things people can see is the final action, and they do not know how the internal processes work and communicate inside the embedded computing device to achieve the desired result. Augmented reality (AR) can overcome this issue and produce a magic-lens view for revealing hidden embedded computing activities. This can result in learners achieving a better level of knowledge and awareness of the technology, as well as higher learning outcomes. AR on its own will not improve the learning processes without first considering how to manage and represent the hidden information. Therefore, a pedagogical virtual machine (PVM) model was employed, and to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed model. We conducted an experiment based on a problem-solving educational mobile robot task. Twenty students participated in the experimental (AR approach) and control (conventional approach) group.

Research geared at utilizing technology to mend social and communication impairments in children with autism is actively underway. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a relatively recent technology that has the potential of being an effective therapeutic tool for developing various skills in autistic children. This paper presents an interactive scenario-based VR system developed to improve the communications skills of autistic children. The system utilizes speech recognition to provide natural interaction and role-play and turntaking to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the immersive environment on the social performance of autistic children. In experiments conducted, participants showed more improved performance with a computer augmented virtual environment (CAVE) than with a head mounted display (HMD) or a normal desktop. The results indicate that immersive VR could be more satisfactory and motivational than desktop for children with ASD.","Autism spectrum disorder; Communication skill; Immersion; Social performance; Virtual reality","Diseases; Helmet mounted displays; Speech recognition; Technology transfer; Virtual reality; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Communication skills; Head mounted displays; Immersion; Immersive environment; Immersive virtual reality; Social performance; Education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020066717

However, small screen size can lead to loss of context and make interaction with magnified displays challenging. We hypothesize that controlling the viewport with head motion can be natural and help in gaining access to magnified displays. We implement this idea using a Google Glass that displays the magnified smartphone screenshots received in real time via Bluetooth. Instead of navigating with touch gestures on the magnified smartphone display, the users can view different screen locations by rotating their head, and remotely interacting with the smartphone. It is equivalent to looking at a large virtual image through a head contingent viewing port, in this case, the Glass display with ∼ 15° field of view. The system can transfer seven screenshots per second at 8× magnification, sufficient for tasks where the display content does not change rapidly. A pilot evaluation of this approach was conducted with eight normally sighted and four visually impaired subjects performing assigned tasks using calculator and music player apps. Results showed that performance in the calculation task was faster with the Glass than with the phone's built-in screen zoom. We conclude that head contingent scanning control can be beneficial in navigating magnified small smartphone displays, at least for tasks involving familiar content layout. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Google Glass; low-vision aid; screen magnification; smartphone app","Glass; Smartphones; Touch screens; Wearable computers; Field of views; Gaining access; Head motion; Low vision; Music players; Small screens; Virtual images; Visually impaired; Signal encoding; Article; client server application; clinical trial (topic); human; image display; information processing; low vision; low vision magnifier; macular degeneration; mobile application; smartphone; visual acuity; visual orientation; adult; aged; case report; computer assisted diagnosis; computer interface; computer terminal; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; female; image enhancement; male; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; treatment outcome; Vision, Low; Adult; Aged; Computer Terminals; Data Display; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Smartphone; Treatment Outcome; User-Computer Interface; Vision, Low",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011664764

Moreover, such generalization is prevented by preexposure to the context (CTX), presumably due to an improved representation of such context. We investigated whether preexposure and time-passing modulate generalization of contextual anxiety, in humans. On Day 1, 42 participants (preexposure group) explored two virtual offices, while 41 participants (no-preexposure group) explored a virtual stadium. On Day 2 (24 h later), all participants learned to associate one office (CTX+) with unpredictable unconditioned stimuli (USs), and another office (CTX2) with safety. On Day 3, either 24 h (recent test) or 2 wk (remote test) later, participants revisited CTX2 and CTX+ without USs, as well as a generalization context (G-CTX). Results revealed successfully conditioned anxiety and anxiety generalization for ratings (G-CTX was as aversive as CTX+ was), while safety generalization was found for startle responses (G-CTX elicited startle attenuation as CTX2 did). Time between learning and testing enhanced generalization as reflected by comparable startle responses to all three offices in the remote test. Contextual preexposure facilitated extinction of explicit conditioned anxiety assessed with ratings. These results suggest that memory trace of a context degrades with passage of time in humans like in animals and, consequently, anxiety generalization enhances. After context preexposure, high cognitive processes seem to be crucially involved in facilitating extinction (or safety) learning. © 2016 Andreatta et al.",,"anxiety; Article; association; aversion; conditioning; controlled study; female; human; learning; male; memory; priority journal; safety; startle reflex; time; adult; analysis of variance; anxiety; arousal; auditory stimulation; conditioned reflex; electrodermal response; learning; pathophysiology; physiology; psychological rating scale; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; recall; time factor; virtual reality; young adult; Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety; Arousal; Conditioning, Classical; Female; Galvanic Skin Response; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Male; Mental Recall; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Reflex, Startle; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Virtual Reality; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010469652

Standard treatment includes physiotherapy. No trial has evaluated whether or not adding aquatic therapy (AT) to land-based therapy (LBT) exercises helps to keep muscles strong and children independent. Objectives: To assess the feasibility of recruiting boys with DMD to a randomised trial evaluating AT (primary objective) and to collect data from them; to assess how, and how well, the intervention and trial procedures work. Design: Parallel-group, single-blind, randomised pilot trial with nested qualitative research. Setting: Six paediatric neuromuscular units. Participants: Children with DMD aged 7–16 years, established on corticosteroids, with a North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score of 8–34 and able to complete a 10-m walk without aids/assistance. Exclusions: > 20% variation between baseline screens 4 weeks apart and contraindications. Interventions: Participants were allocated on a 1 : 1 ratio to (1) optimised, manualised LBT (prescribed by specialist neuromuscular physiotherapists) or (2) the same plus manualised AT (30 minutes, twice weekly for 6 months: active assisted and/or passive stretching regime; simulated or real functional activities; submaximal exercise). Semistructured interviews with participants, parents (n = 8) and professionals (n = 8) were analysed using Framework analysis. An independent rater reviewed patient records to determine the extent to which treatment was optimised. A cost-impact analysis was performed. Quantitative and qualitative data were mixed using a triangulation exercise. Main outcome measures: Feasibility of recruiting 40 participants in 6 months, participant and therapist views on the acceptability of the intervention and research protocols, clinical outcomes including NSAA, independent assessment of treatment optimisation and intervention costs. Results: Over 6 months, 348 children were screened – most lived too far from centres or were enrolled in other trials. Twelve (30% of target) were randomised to AT (n = 8) or control (n = 4). People in the AT (n = 8) and control (n = 2: attrition because of parental report) arms contributed outcome data. The mean change in NSAA score at 6 months was –5.5 [standard deviation (SD) 7.8] for LBT and –2.8 (SD 4.1) in the AT arm. One boy suffered pain and fatigue after AT, which resolved the same day. Physiotherapists and parents valued AT and believed that it should be delivered in community settings. The independent rater considered AT optimised for three out of eight children, with other children given programmes that were too extensive and insufficiently focused. The estimated NHS costs of 6-month service were between £1970 and £2734 per patient. Limitations: The focus on delivery in hospitals limits generalisability. Conclusions: Neither a full-scale frequentist randomised controlled trial (RCT) recruiting in the UK alone nor a twice-weekly open-ended AT course delivered at tertiary centres is feasible. Further intervention development research is needed to identify how community-based pools can be accessed, and how families can link with each other and community physiotherapists to access tailored AT programmes guided by highly specialised physiotherapists. Bayesian RCTs may be feasible; otherwise, time series designs are recommended. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2017.",,"adolescent; Article; child; clinical article; controlled study; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; electronic medical record; exercise; feasibility study; female; human; hydrotherapy; land based therapy; male; mass screening; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; pilot study; prescription; qualitative research; quality of life; stretching; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; visual analog scale; walking; clinical trial; cost benefit analysis; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; economics; kinesiotherapy; methodology; multicenter study; national health service; procedures; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; swimming; Adolescent; Child; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Male; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Research Design; Single-Blind Method; State Medicine; Swimming; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021282265

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Online intervention in national sample of emergency medicine physicians who make triage decisions at US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 368 emergency medicine physicians primarily working at non-trauma centers. A random sample (n=200) of those with primary outcome data was reassessed at six months. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one hour of exposure to an adventure video game (Night Shift) or apps based on traditional didactic education (myATLS and Trauma Life Support MCQ Review), both on iPads. Night Shift was developed to recalibrate the process of using pattern recognition to recognize moderate-severe injuries (representativeness heuristics) through the use of stories to promote behavior change (narrative engagement). Physicians were randomized with a 2×2 factorial design to intervention (game v traditional education apps) and then to the experimental condition under which they completed the outcome assessment tool (low v high cognitive load). Blinding could not be maintained after allocation but group assignment was masked during the analysis phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of a virtual simulation that included 10 cases; in four of these the patients had severe injuries. Participants completed the simulation within four weeks of their intervention. Decisions to admit, discharge, or transfer were measured. The proportion of patients under-triaged (patients with severe injuries not transferred to a trauma center) was calculated then (primary outcome) and again six months later, with a different set of cases (primary outcome of follow-up study). The secondary outcome was effect of cognitive load on under-triage. RESULTS: 149 (81%) physicians in the game arm and 148 (80%) in the traditional education arm completed the trial. Of these, 64/100 (64%) and 58/100 (58%), respectively, completed reassessment at six months. The mean age was 40 (SD 8.9), 283 (96%) were trained in emergency medicine, and 207 (70%) were ATLS (advanced trauma life support) certified. Physicians exposed to the game under-triaged fewer severely injured patients than those exposed to didactic education (316/596 (0.53) v 377/592 (0.64), estimated difference 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.16; P<0.001). Cognitive load did not influence under-triage (161/308 (0.53) v 155/288 (0.54) in the game arm; 197/300 (0.66) v 180/292 (0.62) in the traditional educational apps arm; P=0.66). At six months, physicians exposed to the game remained less likely to under-triage patients (146/256 (0.57) v 172/232 (0.74), estimated difference 0.17, 0.09 to 0.25; P<0.001). No physician reported side effects. The sample might not reflect all emergency medicine physicians, and a small set of cases was used to assess performance. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with apps based on traditional didactic education, exposure of physicians to a theoretically grounded video game improved triage decision making in a validated virtual simulation. Though the observed effect was large, the wide confidence intervals include the possibility of a small benefit, and the real world efficacy of this intervention remains uncertain. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",,"adult; advanced trauma life support care; Article; behavior change; confidence interval; controlled study; demography; educational technology; emergency health service; emergency medicine; emergency physician; female; human; injury severity; intervention study; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; outcome assessment; pattern recognition; Poisson distribution; priority journal; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; software; video game; clinical trial; comparative study; decision making; decision support system; emergency health service; heuristics; hospital emergency service; mobile application; physician; procedures; standards; statistics and numerical data; utilization; video game; Adult; Decision Making; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Emergency Medicine; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Heuristics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Physicians; Trauma Centers; Triage; Video Games",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041226030

Firstly, we propose a reliable and efficient method to extract the brain from MRI datasets based on dividing the brain into blocks. Then, we design a trapezoid opacity transfer function based on CUDA-based real-time volume ray-casting, which is dedicated for the volume rendering to make the inspection more intuitive. Besides, the inspection of different tissues benefits understanding the volumetric datasets, so we also design layer filter for the segmented rhesus macaque brain datasets, which facilitates inspection of interior in ROI by an intuitive bimanual interaction via a Leap Motion sensor. Our experiments prove the usability and efficiency of the proposed methods. © 2016 ACM.","3D inspection; Bimanual gesture interaction; Brain extraction; Rhesus macaque; Volume visualization","Extraction; Interactive computer graphics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Volume rendering; 3D inspection; Brain extraction; Gesture interaction; Rhesus macaque; Volume visualization; Inspection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009810525

They can provide basic skills training in a controlled environment and free of risks for patients. They can also offer objective performance assessment without the need for proctors. However, designing effective user interfaces that allow the acquisition of the appropriate technical skills on these systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to examine a process for achieving interface and environment fidelity during the development of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST). Two iterations of the design process were conducted and evaluated. For that purpose, a total of 42 subjects participated in two experimental studies in which two versions of the VBLaST were compared to the accepted standard in the surgical community for training and assessing basic laparoscopic skills in North America, the FLS box-trainer. Participants performed 10 trials of the peg transfer task on each trainer. The assessment of task performance was based on the validated FLS scoring method. Moreover, a subjective evaluation questionnaire was used to assess the fidelity aspects of the VBLaST relative to the FLS trainer. Finally, a focus group session with expert surgeons was conducted as a comparative situated evaluation after the first design iteration. This session aimed to assess the fidelity aspects of the early VBLaST prototype as compared to the FLS trainer. The results indicate that user performance on the earlier version of the VBLaST resulting from the first design iteration was significantly lower than the performance on the standard FLS box-trainer. The comparative situated evaluation with domain experts permitted us to identify some issues related to the visual, haptic and interface fidelity on this early prototype. Results of the second experiment indicate that the performance on the second generation VBLaST was significantly improved as compared to the first generation and not significantly different from that of the standard FLS box-trainer. Furthermore, the subjects rated the fidelity features of the modified VBLaST version higher than the early version. These findings demonstrate the value of the comparative situated evaluation sessions entailing hands on reflection by domain experts to achieve the environment and interface fidelity and training objectives when designing a virtual reality laparoscopic trainer. This suggests that this method could be used successfully in the future to enhance the value of VR systems as an alternative to physical trainers for laparoscopic surgery skills. Some recommendations on how to use this method to achieve the environment and interface fidelity of a VR laparoscopic surgical trainer are identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Interaction design; Iterative design; Simulator fidelity; surgical training; Virtual reality (VR)","Design; Haptic interfaces; Iterative methods; Laparoscopy; Surgery; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Controlled environment; Interaction design; Iterative design; Performance assessment; Simulator fidelity; Subjective evaluations; Surgical training; Virtual reality trainer; Surgical equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979747876

The purpose of this research is to test individuals' propensity to transfer market mavenism – a characteristic associated with a group of highly knowledgeable consumers who are disseminators of generalized marketplace information – from physical to virtual world environments and the features of these ‘cyber-mavens.’ We posit that cyber-mavens are more likely to be immersed in flow experiences – the feeling of total immersion and deep involvement in human–computer mediated interactions – and to trial new products in virtual worlds. We also test hypotheses regarding a number of other demographic features and individual characteristics of likely mavens. The analysis is based on ANOVA, with post-hoc tests for group comparison. Our findings indicate that while ‘real-life’ market mavenism remains most dominant, mavens are able to extend this capacity into virtual worlds, suggesting the transferability of the maven concept across major channels. We also find that cyber-mavens have a greater propensity to experience ‘flow’ in virtual worlds than non-mavens and are more likely to trial new products in order to satisfy hedonist motives for personal interest in new products. Further, our findings indicate that cyber-mavens can be male or female, are well-educated, and slightly older consumers, are keen users of virtual worlds and have knowledge of other mavens. This study represents one of the first attempts to better understand how consumer behavior might differ in virtual world channels, and, by so doing, better inform our understanding of an important group of consumers for digital goods, namely cyber-mavens. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Consumer innovativeness; Cyber-mavens; Flow; Market mavens; Virtual worlds","Commerce; Consumer behavior; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Computer-mediated interactions; Consumer Innovativeness; Cyber-mavens; Demographic features; Flow; Individual characteristics; Virtual worlds; Web-based environment; Virtual reality; hedonic analysis; Internet; market system; social media; variance analysis; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997125444

Despite the success of music games with instrument-shaped controllers, little is known about what makes these kind of controllers entertaining. The aim of this article is to shed light on the enjoyment mechanisms of such music games and their particular controllers. Review of the literature. The literature’s theoretical foundation lies in the concept of natural mapping, i.e. the similarity of actions performed in the real world and their representation within the videogame. A review of the literature finds that most approaches are too simplistic, as they limit game enjoyment with natural mapping to higher intuitiveness. In contrast, challenge can also foster game enjoyment. Methodology. Two parallelized sample groups (N=20) played three levels of a music game with increasing difficulty with either a Guitar Hero controller or with a real guitar. Perceived difficulty and game enjoyment were collected via questionnaires. Analysis. A 2x3 mixed-design ANOVA was conducted for significance testing. It revealed a significant increase in enjoyment and perceived difficulty both for advanced game levels and the real guitar. A posteriori multiple regression showed that the increase in enjoyment with the real guitar could not be attributed to the higher challenge it produced alone. Conclusions and recommendations for further research. The results suggest that intuitiveness is not the single factor for music game enjoyment with natural controllers. Further research might investigate the role of simulation and identification with attractive roles, as both could act as sources for game enjoyment and natural mapping might facilitate these factors. Applications for learning and teaching should consider debriefing as a method to facilitate transfer of the game experience into the real world. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","engagement; enjoyment; game controllers; music games; natural controllers; natural mapping; simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974601985

The DA procedure included four phases: Pre-teaching test, teaching, post-teaching and transfer test two weeks after teaching. The teaching phase includes mediated learning experience strategies. Children's cognitive modifiability was examined by pre- to post-teaching improvement and by the transfer test. Children in Grades 1 and 2 (n = 117) were randomly assigned into three experimental groups and one control group. Each of the experimental groups was given the teaching phase in a different modality: 3D Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR, n = 36), 2D (n = 36), and tangible blocks (TB, n = 24). The control group (n = 21) was not given teaching phase. The teaching phase included strategies of solving problems from the Analogies Subtest of the Cognitive Modifiability Battery (CMB). Pre- And post-teaching CMB Analogies tests were administered to all groups followed by CMB Transfer Analogies two weeks later. The findings indicate that the 2D and TB groups showed higher cognitive modifiability than the control group. Also, the findings indicate that teaching in a 3D IVR environment contributed to the children's cognitive modifiability more than in the other groups in the CMB Transfer Analogies. The findings are discussed in relation to the unique enhancing characteristics of the 3D IVR condition combined with the applied mediation strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to determine how effective they are in achieving motor learning goals and fitness benefits as players gain experience. Design: We employed a repeated measures design to determine changes in physical exertion and engagement with training. Methods: Fourteen healthy adults trained on the XBOX Kinect video game Dance Central using a skill-based protocol to examine changes in energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), METs, limb movement, game proficiency, and player engagement in initial, post-training, and transfer-testing of a full-body dance exer-game. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.05. Results: Both EE, HR, and METs increased from initial (EE 4.89 ± 1.35, HR 103 ± 18, METs 4.25 ± 0.72) to post-training (EE 5.92 ± 1.25, HR 110 ± 15, METs 5.05 ± 0.75) and were greatest during transfer-testing (EE 6.34 ± 1.35, HR 115 ± 17, METs 5.42 ± 0.88, p ≤ 0.001). Proficiency, measured by game scores, also increased from initial to post-training and transfer-testing (≤ 0.002). Limb movement and player engagement remained unchanged. Conclusions: It is important to understand whether player physiological and psychophysiological responses change with continued game-play. Although Dance Central involves whole-body movement, physical exertion remained at moderate levels after training. As exer-game and virtual reality systems move from their initial novelty, research about how players react to continued involvement with a game can guide game developers to maintain a freshness through game progression that preserves the participant's attentional focus, minimizes attrition and maintains a prescribed level of energy exertion. © 2015 Sports Medicine Australia.","Dance; Energy expenditure; Engagement; Exercise; METs; Video games","adult; Article; dancing; energy expenditure; exercise; female; human; human experiment; limb movement; male; normal human; physiology; psychophysiology; video game; adolescent; biomechanics; energy metabolism; exercise; heart rate; motor performance; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Dancing; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Video Games; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958039213

Recently, a multimodal and holistic framework was developed, the Game Transfer Phenomena (GTP) framework. It investigates the relation between in-game elements (e.g. structural characteristics, in-game phenomena) involved in everyday involuntary phenomena or intrusions with game contents, and the subsequent implications of these phenomena on gamers’ well-being. This paper aims to overview research on GTP for explaining the development of the framework and discuss its potential applications. The GTP framework was developed based on studies conducted with over 3,500 gamers collected via interviews, online forums and surveys. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the factorial structure and demonstrated good reliability and validity of the items in the scale used for assessing GTP. The GTP experiences were classified in three main modalities: (i) altered sensorial perceptions comprising perceptions and/or sensations in all sensorial channels, cross-sensory or multisensory. These were further subdivided into: altered visual perceptions (e.g. visual hallucinations), altered auditory perceptions (e.g. auditory imagery), and altered body/other perceptions (e.g. illusion of body motion). (ii) Automatic mental processes comprising thoughts, urges and automatic mental actions, and (iii) behaviors and actions comprising simple actions or more elaborate behaviors (e.g. verbal outburst). The GTP framework can assist in identifying an underlying mechanism of the virtual immersion either for reducing potential unwanted effects or for promoting desirable cognitions and behaviors with educative, therapeutic and entertainment means. © 2016 by Interactive Media Institute.","Effects of playing video games; Game transfer phenomena; Implicit cognitions; Non-volitional phenomena","adolescent; adult; Article; conceptual framework; confirmatory factor analysis; game transfer phenomena framework; hearing; human; immersion; interview; mental function; sensation; video game; virtual reality; vision; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019576435

This study aims to converge the pedagogical benefits of role-playing, educational technology and digital games to investigate the effectiveness of using 3d digital roleplaying games (RPGs) in classrooms to improve transferal of theoretical knowledge to practice in design education. Qualitative data were collected from digital media lecturers to identify desirable learning outcomes and describe teaching and learning challenges of digital media courses. Building upon Bloom's taxonomy, feedback from lecturers informed the development of a conceptual framework in the use of digital RPGs as learning tools to achieve learning outcomes for digital media education. A 3d RPG, Virtual Designer, was developed and tested on students from two campuses of a transnational university in Vietnam and Australia. Through Virtual Designer, undergraduate Digital Media students role-played as designer practitioners in a 3d simulated workplace, applying design knowledge into different hypothetical situations. A quasi-experiment was conducted, where students completed design knowledge tests before and after intervention to evaluate students' ability to transfer theoretical knowledge into practice from the use of Virtual Designer as part of their learning journey. Students also completed surveys and participated in focus group sessions to provide input on as well as perceived benefits or drawbacks on how the use of digital RPGs impacted their learning. This paper reports results and findings acquired from the quasi-experiment, in which digital media students completed pre/post-tests before and after playing Virtual Designer in class. Paired-samples t-test was conducted. Results indicated that there are students experience statistically significant performance gains in post-tests after using Virtual Designer as a digital learning tool to reinforce design theory knowledge. © The Authors, 2016.

Furthermore, training outdoors is dangerous due to traffic, noise and weather conditions. Having a controlled indoor environment is safer but not always available. To tackle this problem, we developed an audio-based computer game, Legend of Iris (LOI), specifically designed to train navigation skills. The game is a 3D exploration game, which uses the headtracking capabilities of the Oculus Rift to create an immersive experience, and the new sound libraries AstoundSound and Phonon3D, to generate an accurate and realistic soundscape. These libraries use a head-related transfer function, allowing the player to localize the audio source in 3D space. The design of LOI involved selecting sounds that are easily recognizable to provide cues to blind people playing the game. A subset of these cues were incorporated into the game. To verify the effectiveness of the game in developing audio orientation and navigation skills, we performed a preliminary qualitative experiment with blind children in a dedicated school. LOI scored high in terms of accuracy and immersion, but a larger test is required to make statistical conclusions. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Libraries; Motion compensation; Navigation; Virtual reality; 3d explorations; Audio sources; Audio-based navigation; Blind children; Head related transfer function; Indoor environment; Orientation and navigation; Qualitative experiments; Computer games",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963935798

Participants who undergo these computer-based interventions often show little evidence of the ability to generalize such learning to novel, everyday social communicative interactions. This lack of generalized learning may result, in part, from the limited use of fundamental elements of serious game design that are known to maximize learning.

We examined the effects of alcohol on fear acquisition and extinction within a virtual environment. Healthy volunteers were administered alcohol (0.4. g/kg) or placebo and underwent acquisition and extinction from different viewpoints of a virtual courtyard, in which the conditioned stimulus, paired with a mild electric shock, was centrally located. Participants returned the following day to test fear recall from both viewpoints of the courtyard. Skin conductance responses were recorded as an index of conditioned fear. Successful fear acquisition under alcohol contrasted with impaired extinction learning evidenced by persistent conditioned responses (Experiment 1). Participants' impairments in extinction under alcohol correlated with impairments in remembering object-locations in the courtyard seen from one viewpoint when tested from the other viewpoint. Alcohol-induced extinction impairments were overcome by increasing the number of extinction trials (Experiment 2). However, a test of fear recall the next day showed persistent fear in the alcohol group across both viewpoints. Thus, alcohol impaired extinction rather than acquisition of fear, suggesting that extinction is more dependent than acquisition on alcohol-sensitive representations of spatial context. Overall, extinction learning under alcohol was slower, weaker and less context-specific, resulting in persistent fear at test that generalized to the extinction viewpoint. The selective effect on extinction suggests an effect of alcohol on prefrontal involvement, while the reduced context-specificity implicates the hippocampus. These findings have important implications for the use of alcohol by individuals with clinical anxiety disorders. © 2015 The Authors.","Alcohol; Extinction; Fear memory","alcohol; alcohol; adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholic beverage; Article; conditioning; controlled study; electric shock; extinction learning; fear; female; hippocampus; human; human experiment; learning; male; memory disorder; normal human; prefrontal cortex; recall; recognition; reinforcement; skin conductance; task performance; virtual reality; adolescent; conditioned reflex; drug effects; electrostimulation; fear; learning; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Conditioning, Classical; Electric Stimulation; Ethanol; Extinction, Psychological; Fear; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Mental Recall; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938704310

The proposed approach is applied on a real-world problem in the domain of biomedicine - prediction of inner knee temperatures during therapeutic cooling (cryotherapy) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery. A validated simulation model of the cryotherapeutic treatment is used to generate a substantial amount of diverse data from different simulation scenarios. We apply machine learning methods on the simulated data to construct a predictive model that provides a prediction for the inner temperature variable based on other system variables whose measurement is more feasible, i.e. skin temperatures. First, we perform feature ranking using the RReliefF method. Next, based on the feature ranking results, we investigate the predictive performance and time/memory efficiency of several predictive modeling methods: linear regression, regression trees, model trees, and ensembles of regression and model trees. Results have shown that using only temperatures from skin sensors as input attributes gives excellent prediction for the temperature in the knee center. Moreover, satisfying predictive accuracy is also achieved using short history of temperatures from just two skin sensors (placed anterior and posterior to the knee) as input variables. The model trees perform the best with prediction error in the same range as the accuracy of the simulated data (0.1. °C). Furthermore, they satisfy the requirements for small memory size and real-time response. We successfully validate the best performing model tree with real data from in vivo temperature measurement from a patient undergoing cryotherapy after ACL reconstruction. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Biomedicine; Computer simulation; Cryotherapy; Feature ranking; Predictive modeling","Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Cooling; Cryotherapy; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Temperature measurement; Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomedicine; Feature ranking; Inner body temperature; Machine learning methods; Predictive modeling; Predictive performance; Reconstructive surgery; Trees (mathematics); anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; blood flow; body temperature; body temperature measurement; computer simulation; cryotherapy; heat transfer; human; inner knee temperature; knee; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; postoperative period; prediction; predictive value; sensor; skin temperature; thermogenesis; tissue metabolism; biological model; body temperature; computer assisted therapy; computer simulation; computer system; induced hypothermia; knee; pathophysiology; procedures; rehabilitation; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; surgery; thermal conductivity; thermography; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Body Temperature; Computer Simulation; Computer Systems; Humans; Hypothermia, Induced; Knee; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Thermal Conductivity; Thermography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944275280

Here, we investigated for the first time generalization processes in contextual fear conditioning. Thirty-two participants were guided through two virtual offices (acquisition phases). Mildly painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US) were unpredictably delivered in one office (anxiety context, CTX. +), but never in the other office (safety context, CTX-). During the generalization test, participants were guided through CTX. +, CTX-, and the generalization context (G-CTX), which contained features of both the CTX. + and the CTX-, but no US was delivered. We found successful contextual fear conditioning (i.e., the CTX. + compared to the CTX- elicited potentiated startle responses and was rated with more negative valence, higher arousal and higher anxiety). Importantly, implicit and explicit responses dissociated in the generalization test. Thus, participants rated the G-CTX as more arousing and anxiogenic than the CTX- indicating anxiety generalization, but they showed enhanced startle responses to the CTX. + only, while the G-CTX and the CTX- did not differ. In summary, healthy participants on an explicit level responded to the generalization context like to the anxiety context, but on an implicit level responded to the generalization context like to the safety context. Possibly, this dissociation suggests distinct and specific generalization processes underlying contextual fear. © 2015.","Conditioned anxiety generalization; Contextual fear conditioning; Startle response","adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; arousal; Article; clinical article; conditioning; contextual fear conditioning; contextual stimuli; controlled study; electric shock; electromyography; female; habituation; human; male; posttraumatic stress disorder; questionnaire; safety; startle reflex; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stimulus generalization; unconditioned stimulus; virtual reality; visual analog scale; anxiety; association; conditioned reflex; fear; physiology; psychology; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Arousal; Conditioning, Classical; Cues; Electroshock; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Reflex, Startle; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943816727

However, it is unclear how the amount of correspondence between a virtual interaction metaphor to the real-world equivalent, otherwise known as dimensional symmetry, affects bimanual pscyhomotor skills training and how skills learned in the virtual simulation transfer to the real world. How does the number of degrees of freedom enhance or hinder the learning process? Does the increase in dimensional symmetry affect cognitive load? In an empirical evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of a natural 6-DOF interaction metaphor to a simplified 3-DOF metaphor. Our simulation interactively educates users in the step-by-step process of taking a precise measurement using calipers and micrometers in a simulated technical workbench environment. We conducted a usability study to evaluate the user experience and pedagogical benefits using measures including a pre and post cognition questionnaire over all levels of Bloom's taxonomy, workload assessment, system usability, and real world psychomotor assessment tasks. Results from the pre and post cognition questionnaires suggest that learning outcomes improved throughout all levels of Bloom's taxonomy for both conditions, and trends in the data suggest that the 6-DOF metaphor was more effective in real-world skill transference compared to the 3-DOF metaphor. © 2015 IEEE.","Bimanual interaction; dimensional symmetry; psychomotor skills education","Blooms (metal); Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Education; Human computer interaction; Personnel training; Surveys; Taxonomies; Virtual reality; Bi-manual interaction; Education and training; Empirical evaluations; Immersive virtual environments; Interaction metaphors; Number of degrees of freedom; Precise measurements; Virtual interactions; E-learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954500994

Specifically, We first adjust the palm image using the mirror of the dorsal image. Then color transfer is performed for the palm image to ensure its similar color as the dorsal image. Finally interpolation is used to further adjust the direct texture mapping considering the virtual seams in fingers and thumb side. The proposed method is very efficient and experimental results show that the generated virtual hand model is more realistic than conventional virtual hands and can yield a stronger sense of immersion in the virtual world. © 2015 IEEE.","Computational modeling; Indexes; Joints; Thumb","Artificial intelligence; Color image processing; End effectors; Joints (structural components); Mapping; Virtual reality; Color transfers; Computational model; Direct texture mapping; Indexes; Skin textures; Texture mapping; Thumb; Virtual worlds; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954321580

Through examples we show that the quasi-propulsive efficiency is a rational non-dimensional metric of the propulsive fitness of fish and fish-like mechanisms, consistent with the goal to minimize fuel consumption under size and velocity constraints. We perform two-dimensional viscous simulations and apply the concept of quasi-propulsive efficiency to illustrate and discuss the efficiency of two-dimensional undulating foils employing first carangiform and then anguilliform kinematics. We show that low efficiency may be due to adverse body-propulsor hydrodynamic interactions, which cannot be accounted for by an increase in friction drag, as done previously, since at the Reynolds number Re = 5 000 considered in the simulations, pressure is a major contributor to both thrust and drag. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","fish swimming; quasi-propulsive efficiency; self-propelled; swimming efficiency","Drag; Fish; Propulsion; Reynolds number; Fish swimming; Flexible bodies; Hydrodynamic interaction; Propulsive efficiencies; self-propelled; System efficiency; Velocity constraints; Viscous simulations; Efficiency; Anguilliformes; animal; biological model; computer simulation; energy metabolism; energy transfer; fish; flow kinetics; friction; mechanical stress; physiology; procedures; shear strength; viscosity; Animals; Computer Simulation; Energy Metabolism; Energy Transfer; Fishes; Friction; Models, Biological; Rheology; Shear Strength; Stress, Mechanical; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940399443

This is because the brain recognizes the virtual world as real and this facilitates the transfer of the newly acquired skills to the real world. In this paper, we present a game that has been designed and developed with the aim of teaching spatial orientation abilities to teenagers with mild intellectual impairments. In particular, the game focuses on the training of two basic skills: Perspective taking and mental rotation. Perspective taking refers to the ability of imagining how the world looks like from another person's point of view, while mental rotation is the ability to mentally represent and manipulate physical objects in one's mind. The game, which takes place in a virtual environment, shows the player a scene with some objects on the table. The player has to choose among four provided alternatives, the one that shows how the scene would look like from a different side of the table. The game was first developed to be used with either a desktop pc monitor or an interactive touch table. In this case, a virtual world is represented, but the player is not completely immersed in it, he just looks at the scene from outside. A second version of the same game has then been developed using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), which makes the player feel immersed in the virtual environment, where he can freely move around just as if it was real. In this paper, we discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the immersive Virtual Reality (VR) compared to the desktop VR. In fact, on the one hand, having the possibility to ""dive"" into the virtual world allows the player to: Better build a mental model of the scene and the involved objects by freely moving around the table and examining the objects from all the possible perspectives; Manage by himself the amount of help needed: It is always possible, at any time of the game, to move to the other side of the table and see what the scene looks like. Increase his involvement in the game by exploring the virtual world as he pleases. Have a better learning transfer thanks to the similarities between the virtual and the real worlds. On the other hand, using a HMD can be tiring and cause sickness to some players. Furthermore, the presence of a complete environment in which to move and explore, can draw the attention away from the main task of the game and therefore influence learning negatively. Experiments are planned to verify the foreseen advantages and disadvantages involving young adults with mild intellective disabilities.","Innovative games-based learning; Mental rotation; Perspective taking; Virtual worlds","Helmet mounted displays; Interactive computer graphics; Personnel training; Sensory perception; Desktop virtual reality; Head mounted displays; Immersive virtual reality; Innovative games-based learning; Mental rotation; Perspective taking; Spatial orientations; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955151400

However, because more realistic and complex situations can be implemented, important questions arise, concerning the validity and representativeness of the observed behavior, with reference to a real situation. One example is the investigation of a critical (virtually dangerous) situation, in which the participant knows that no actual threat is present in the simulated situation, and might thus exhibit a behavioral response that is far from reality. This poses serious problems, for instance in training situations, in terms of transfer of learning to a real situation. Facing this difficult question, it seems necessary to study the relationships between three factors: immersion (physical realism), presence (psychological realism) and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework, in which presence is a necessary condition for the emergence of a behavior that is representative of what is observed in real conditions. Presence itself depends not only on physical immersive characteristics of the Virtual Reality setup, but also on contextual and psychological factors. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.","Behavior; Immersion; Presence; Virtual Reality","Optical engineering; Behavior; Behavioral response; Conceptual frameworks; Immersion; Presence; Psychological factors; Psychological realisms; Transfer of learning; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928473664

In order to get airborne, the air wing depends upon the skills of a small number of officers responsible for the safe and rapid launch of aircraft from the carrier deck. These officers, known as ""shooters"", receive initial classroom training on the systems they use then receive qualification to be launch officers through on-the-job training. Due to scheduling complexities the training to achieve qualification is disjointed and often requires trainees to go underway with different aircraft carriers to complete their training. The current approach results in burdens on the parent command, host commands, and the trainees. Of greater concern is the lack of consistency in the training of such a high risk activity. This paper describes the results of a job task analysis conducted to provide insights into the skills required to perform the duties of a launch officer. Further, the information from the job task analysis was examined and a representative finite state machine was developed and is presented. Finally, a portable, low-cost virtual environment created based on the work described above is discussed. It is proposed that the current virtual reality system used for this demonstration faithfully recreates the required attributes and scenarios to train launch officer tasks and that the prototype system, with proof of training transfer can reduce the burden on commands, trainees, and perhaps most importantly, provide consistent training.

Mars gravity is about l/3rd of Earth's, asteroid and dwarf planets even less. Training for Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) using rovers and spacesuits is challenging at best. Lower gravity planetary environments with distinctive terrain require trained space explorers with interactive human-machine compatibilities. Current visualization methods, such as Virtual Reality (VR) goggles, can be adapted to display a generalized view of planetary surface featuring a visual 3-D interface, yet lack a high-fidelity, immersive environment. Limited terrain mapping and limited methods for reflecting the variable gravitational conditions are two of the primary limitations. In order to better understand human behavior in alternate environments, it is important to study the psycho-physiological components of a subject in a near-Actual simulations. With the potential to augment planetary EVA procedures and address vital human factors associated with space planetary exploration, our team in partnership with the University of North Dakota (UND) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have developed the concept of VISR (Visual Immersion for Simulated Robotics) system. VISR provides an immersive 3-D planetary Virtual Reality model utilizing high performance computing, image processing, 3-D rendering, powered by an expansive referential database. The software manipulates image processing speed with a variable gravity parameter as an input. VISR is compatible with multiple planetary bodies and asteroids whereas the current system applications are limited to the space station and Mars. VISR assists in the study of psycho-physiological effects (human limbs - eye coordination) associated with deep-space travel and low- gravity environments. VISR can be utilized to facilitate short range tele-robotic operation during actual missions. Mars has a vast, geologically complex terrain with existing environments models allowing topographical visualization. Image composition draws upon the significant wealth of information accumulated at JPL over 50 years interacting with solar system bodies. VISR users experience these features in an immersive and interactive environment enhancing human performance in real situations, and assisting scientists and mission planners in system and mission design. VISR integrates the UND developed planetary suit NDX-2, currently used as a simulation tool for 'astronaut training', the LEGACY database for planetary bodies at JPL, human factors and related Psychophysiological studies. The VISR system development will has seen different phases such as development of terrain maps, and their integration with visual device sensor, integration of the LEGACY terrain sysml model which can identify and import relevant physical parameters from available planetary databases, varying the speed of image output to the user by manipulating the gravity parameter, and integrating it with already developed terrain models. This device can be further used to feed real-Time physiological performance data to a separate sensor based system, and study the related effects on human subjects. VISR will be an effective tool which would equip the researchers, mission planners and space travelers for a future planetary manned mission.",,"Asteroids; Database systems; Fighter aircraft; Gravitation; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Image processing; Interplanetary spacecraft; Landforms; Liquid sloshing; Manned space flight; Physiology; Planets; Planning; Reconfigurable hardware; Robotics; Space stations; Spacecraft; Three dimensional computer graphics; Training aircraft; Virtual reality; Visualization; Extravehicular activity; High performance computing; Human Machine Interface; Interactive 3d visualizations; Interactive Environments; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; University of North Dakota; Virtual reality modeling; Behavioral research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991489707

Thanks to advances in technology, a growing number of researchers are making use of computer-based virtual environments to draw inferences about real-world navigation. However, little research has been done on factors affecting human-computer interactions in navigation tasks. In this study female students completed a virtual route learning task and filled out a battery of questionnaires, which determined levels of computer experience, wayfinding anxiety, neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism and immersive tendencies as well as their preference for a route or survey strategy. Scores on personality traits and individual differences were then correlated with the time taken to complete the navigation task, the length of path travelled, the velocity of the virtual walk and the number of errors. Navigation performance was significantly influenced by wayfinding anxiety, psychoticism, involvement and overall immersive tendencies and was improved in those participants who adopted a survey strategy. In other words, navigation in virtual environments is effected not only by navigational strategy, but also an individual's personality, and other factors such as their level of experience with computers. An understanding of these differences is crucial before performance in virtual environments can be generalised to real-world navigational performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain enough insights for actionable knowledge, the development of models and analysis of modeling results usually requires that models be run many times so that all possibilities can be covered. Central to the goal of our research is, therefore, the use of ensemble visualization of a large scale simulation space to appropriately aid decision makers in reasoning about infrastructure behaviors and vulnerabilities in support of critical infrastructure analysis. This requires the bringing together of computing-driven simulation results with the human decision-making process via interactive visual analysis.

Our system demonstrates a scalable visual analytics infrastructure with mobile interface for analysis, visualization and interaction with large-scale simulation results in order to better understand their inherent structure and predictive capabilities.

Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models have been extensively applied to study its energetics but such applications require a deep understanding of its nutrition, from filtration to assimilation. Being filter feeders, mussels show multiple responses to temporal fluctuations in their food and environment, raising questions that can be investigated by modeling. To provide a better insight into mussel-environment interactions, an experiment was conducted in one of the main French growing zones (Utah Beach, Normandy). Mussel growth was monitored monthly for 18 months, with a large number of environmental descriptors measured in parallel. Food proxies such as chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and phytoplankton were also sampled, in addition to non-nutritious particles. High-frequency physical data recording (e.g., water temperature, immersion duration) completed the habitat description. Measures revealed an increase in dry flesh mass during the first year, followed by a high mass loss, which could not be completely explained by the DEB model using raw external signals. We propose two methods that reconstruct food from shell length and dry flesh mass variations. The former depends on the inversion of the growth equation while the latter is based on iterative simulations. Assemblages of food proxies are then related to reconstructed food input, with a special focus on plankton species. A characteristic contribution is attributed to these sources to estimate nutritional values for mussels. M. edulis shows no preference between most plankton life history traits. Selection is based on the size of the ingested particles, which is modified by the volume and social behavior of plankton species. This finding reveals the importance of diet diversity and both passive and active selections, and confirms the need to adjust DEB models to different populations and sites. © 2014 Picoche et al.",,"chlorophyll a; organic carbon; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; dynamic energy budget; energy transfer; environmental factor; food intake; food preference; food quality; France; growth rate; life history trait; metabolic parameters; Mytilus edulis; nonhuman; nutrient dynamics; nutritional value; particle size; plankton; social behavior; species habitat; water immersion; water temperature; animal; biological model; biomass; calibration; energy metabolism; environment; food preference; geography; growth, development and aging; Mytilus edulis; physiology; phytoplankton; Mytilus; Animals; Biomass; Calibration; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Food Preferences; Food Quality; France; Geography; Models, Biological; Mytilus edulis; Phytoplankton; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908428705

It lowers costs and has fewer constraints than traditional training. The ultimate goal of virtual training is to transfer knowledge gained in a virtual environment to an actual real-world setting. This study tested whether a maintenance procedure could be learnt equally well by virtual-environment and conventional training. Forty-two adults were divided into three equally sized groups: virtual training (GVT® [generic virtual training]), conventional training (using a real tank suspension and preparation station) and control (no training). Participants then performed the procedure individually in the real environment. Both training types (conventional and virtual) produced similar levels of performance when the procedure was carried out in real conditions. Performance level for the two trained groups was better in terms of success and time taken to complete the task, time spent consulting job instructions and number of times the instructor provided guidance. Practitioner Summary: A key issue for virtual environments for training (VETs) is the transfer of skills to real situations. An experiment investigated whether skills acquired in a VET could be applied in a real situation.

In wireless network-based virtual environment, traditional transmission protocol fails to meet the requirements of virtual environment due to variety of nodes distribution, complexity, and difference of bandwidth. Based on our research of rate control for distributed virtual environment, we hereby propose a bandwidth self-adaptive rate control algorithm based on layers of interest. According to effective bandwidth of proxy gateway in distributed virtual environment, this method solving the problem of time inconsistency between publishers and subscribers, constraining occupied bandwidth within the range of effective bandwidth of gateways. Our experiments prove that this algorithm can solve the problem that users’needs of interactive with each other very frequently in wireless network virtual environment. The algorithm automatically match data transmission based on bandwidth and the received datagram is smooth and much more stable.

However, there are few efforts to investigate the liquid cooling effect when the metal target is in contact with a liquid, as is usually the case of the fuel tank of a missile. To study the flow physics and heat transfer characteristics during the interaction, a 3-D unsteady conjugate conduction-natural convection model is developed in this paper and an experiment is also performed to validate the model. The simulation results, using the parameters of the experiment, show that the heat exchange takes place mainly in the vicinity of the metal/liquid interface. At the initial stage of laser irradiation, the natural convection effect is not remarkable and the heat transfer intensity is weak. After that, the heat transfer coefficient increases gradually and approaches to a constant value. Moreover, the temperature variation of the metal plate and the velocity field variation of the liquid are shown to be in well agreement with the ones obtained by experiment, which validates the numerical model. This model can be further used to predict the fluid flow and heat transfer mechanisms in other configurations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, without rigorous assessment, it may be unclear whether all, some, or none of these metrics actually reflect technical skill, which can compromise educational efforts on these simulators. We assessed the construct validity of individual performance metrics on the LapVR simulator (Immersion Medical, San Jose, CA, USA) and used these data to create task-specific summary metrics. Methods: Medical students with no prior laparoscopic experience (novices, N = 12), junior surgical residents with some laparoscopic experience (intermediates, N = 12), and experienced surgeons (experts, N = 11) all completed three repetitions of four LapVR simulator tasks. The tasks included three basic skills (peg transfer, cutting, clipping) and one procedural skill (adhesiolysis). Results: We selected 36 individual metrics on the four tasks that assessed six different aspects of performance, including speed, motion path length, respect for tissue, accuracy, task-specific errors, and successful task completion. Four of seven individual metrics assessed for peg transfer, six of ten metrics for cutting, four of nine metrics for clipping, and three of ten metrics for adhesiolysis discriminated between experience levels. Time and motion path length were significant on all four tasks. We used the validated individual metrics to create summary equations for each task, which successfully distinguished between the different experience levels. Conclusion: Educators should maintain some skepticism when reviewing the plethora of metrics captured by computer-based simulators, as some but not all are valid. We showed the construct validity of a limited number of individual metrics and developed summary metrics for the LapVR. The summary metrics provide a succinct way of assessing skill with a single metric for each task, but require further validation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Education; Evaluation; Laparoscopic surgery; Simulation; Validation; Virtual reality","adult; article; computer based laparoscopic simulator; construct validity; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; medical student; priority journal; resident; simulator; surgeon; surgical training; virtual reality; computer assisted surgery; computer interface; computer simulation; devices; education; equipment design; evaluation study; laparoscopy; medical education; operation duration; procedures; standards; task performance; validation study; Adult; Computer Simulation; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Operative Time; Students, Medical; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903584638

This article presents the results of an investigation of the performance and attention focus of 21 medical interns and surgical residents training in an immersive context. That is, training 'in situation', representing more realistically the demands imposed on the surgeons during minimal access surgery. Methods: Twenty-one medical interns and surgical residents participated in simulation trainings in an integrated operating room for laparoscopic surgery. Various physiological measures of body heat expenditure were gathered as indicators of mental strain and attention focus. Results: The results of the Mann-Whitney test indicated that participants with a poor performance in the two laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases had a significantly (U = 3, p = 0.038) higher heat flux at the start of the procedure (mean 107.08, standard deviation [SD] 24.34) than those who excelled in the two cases (mean 62.64, SD 23.41). Also, the average frontal head temperature of the participants who failed at the task was significantly lower (mean 33.27, SD 0.52) than those who performed well (mean 33.92, SD 0.27). Conclusions: Surgeons cannot operate in a bubble; thus, they should not be trained in one. Combining heat flux and frontal head temperature could be a good measure of deep involvement and attentional focus during performance of simulated surgical tasks. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Attention focus; Cognitive absorption; Immersive training; Mental strain; Simulation training","adult; article; attention; body temperature measurement; cholecystectomy; female; heat transfer; human; human experiment; laparoscopic surgery; male; mental stress; monitor; operating room; performance; priority journal; resident; simulation; simulator; surgical stress; surgical training; virtual reality; body temperature; clinical competence; cognition; computer simulation; education; heat; laparoscopy; medical education; medical education; operating room; physiology; procedures; psychology; workload; young adult; Adult; Attention; Body Temperature; Clinical Competence; Cognition; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Operating Rooms; Workload; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900008462

The human functional single-nucleotide BDNF rs6265 (Val66Met) polymorphism has been found to be associated with alteration in neural BDNF release and function correlating with altered emotional behavior. Here, we investigated for the first time the hypothesis that this polymorphism in humans modulates the context dependency of conditioned fear responses. Applying a new paradigm examining generalization of cued fear across contexts, 70 participants stratified for BDNF Val66Met polymorphism were guided through two virtual offices (context) in which briefly illuminated blue and yellow lights served as cues. In the fear context, one light (conditioned stimulus, CS+) but not the other light (CS-) was associated with an electric shock (unconditioned stimulus, US). In the safety context, both lights were presented too, but no US was delivered. During the test phase, lights were presented again both in learning contexts and in a novel generalization context without any US. All participants showed clear fear conditioning to the CS+ in the fear context as indicated by potentiation of startle responses and reports of fear. No fear reactions were found for the CS+ in the safety context. Importantly, generalization of fear responses indicated by the potentiation of startle response to the CS+ compared with the CS-in the novel context was evident only in the Met-carrying group. These are the first results to provide evidence in humans that BDNF modulates the generalization of fear responses. Such context-dependent generalization processes might predispose Met carriers for affective and anxiety disorders. © 2014 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.","BDNF; context conditioning; cue conditioning; startle reflex; virtual reality","brain derived neurotrophic factor; valine; brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain-derived neurotrophic factor, human; adult; anxiety; article; blue light; conditioned reflex; conditioning; electric shock; fear; female; follow up; genotype; human; light; major clinical study; neuromodulation; photostimulation; priority journal; safety; single nucleotide polymorphism; startle reflex; stimulus generalization; yellow light; association; conditioning; double blind procedure; genetics; learning; male; perceptive discrimination; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Conditioning (Psychology); Cues; Discrimination (Psychology); Double-Blind Method; Electroshock; Fear; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Genotype; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reflex, Startle; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896391886

It is a comparative study, with within-subject design, that compares two different versions of an educational simulation, Czechoslovakia 38-89. Several studies of simulation design suggest that high fidelity on both physical and functional levels is required to evoke a real-world experience and maximize the transfer of learning. On the contrary, recent meta-analysis of the instructional effectiveness of educational computer games indicates that there is no argument to support opting for photorealistic visual designs, because more basic designs such as schematic/textual and cartoon-like designs are equally or more effective. However, existing studies do not relate levels of realism to specific domains of knowledge. Arguably, the appropriate level of visual fidelity depends on the learning objectives of the game/simulation. Czechoslovakia 38-89 is a complex educational simulation for high schools that utilizes the principles of digital game-based learning (DGBL). Its educational objective is to present key events from Czechoslovakia's contemporary history and to enable students to ""experience"" these events from different actors' perspectives. A core element of Czechoslovakia 38-89 is interviews with ""eyewitnesses"" to various events. During the development of the game, we had to make a key decision on how to visually represent these characters: either as photorealistic videos using real actors (photorealistic) or as cartoon-like animations (cartoon-like). In a laboratory study involving 48 Czech high school students (M=16, F=32) with different study backgrounds, we compared two versions of Czechoslovakia 38-89: photorealistic and cartoon-like versions. The simulation's content and its length were identical in all other respects. The results indicate that the vast majority of students preferred the photorealistic version; both for use at school and at home. They evaluated the photorealistic version as being more authentic and attractive. They also considered the photorealistic version to be a better source of information about Czechoslovak contemporary history. © The Authors, 2014.","Authenticity; Czechoslovakia 38-89; Educational computer games; Educational simulations; Game design; Visual realism","Animation; Computer games; Design; Education; Education computing; Authenticity; Czechoslovakia; Educational computer game; Educational simulations; Game design; Visual realism; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923581445

In this paper, we propose a generalizable approach for building predictive models of players' emotional reactions across different games and game genres, as well as other forms of digital stimuli. Our input agnostic approach relies on the following steps: (a) collecting players' physiologically-inferred emotional states during actual gameplay sessions, (b) extrapolating the causal relations between changes in players' emotional states and recorded game events, and (c) building hierarchical cluster models of players' emotional reactions that can later be used to infer individual player models via fuzzy cluster membership vectors. We expect this work to benefit game designers by accelerating the affective playtesting process through the offline simulation of players' reactions to game design adaptations, as well as to contribute towards individually-tailored affective gaming.

The aim of this study was to determine the minimal number of simulator sessions of basic laparoscopic tasks necessary to elaborate an optimal virtual reality training curriculum. Materials and Methods: Eleven medical students with no previous laparoscopic experience were spontaneously enrolled. They were submitted to simulator training sessions starting at level 1 (Immersion Lap VR, San Jose, CA), including sequentially camera handling, peg and transfer, clipping and cutting. Each student trained twice a week until 10 sessions were completed. The score indexes were registered and analyzed. The total of errors of the evaluation sequences (camera, peg and transfer, clipping and cutting) were computed and thereafter, they were correlated to the total of items evaluated in each step, resulting in a success percent ratio for each student for each set of each completed session. Thereafter, we computed the cumulative success rate in 10 sessions, obtaining an analysis of the learning process. By non-linear regression the learning curve was analyzed. Results: By the non-linear regression method the learning curve was analyzed and a r2 = 0.73 (p &lt; 0.001) was obtained, being necessary 4.26 (~five sessions) to reach the plateau of 80% of the estimated acquired knowledge, being that 100% of the students have reached this level of skills. From the fifth session till the 10th, the gain of knowledge was not significant, although some students reached 96% of the expected improvement. Conclusions: This study revealed that after five simulator training sequential sessions the students' learning curve reaches a plateau. The forward sessions in the same difficult level do not promote any improvement in laparoscopic basic surgical skills, and the students should be introduced to a more difficult training tasks level.","Aptitude; General surgery; Laparoscopy; Methods [subheading]; Teaching","article; chi square distribution; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; evaluation study; female; human; laparoscopy; learning curve; male; medical student; reference value; reproducibility; task performance; time; utilization review; Chi-Square Distribution; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Learning Curve; Male; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Students, Medical; Task Performance and Analysis; Time Factors; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891641710

By definition of AR, both artificial and real humans can be simultaneously present and realistically interact among one another. With the help of physics and physiology, we can build in the AR tool together with real human day-night webcam inputs through a simple interaction of heat transfer -getting hot, action and reaction -walking or falling, as well as the physiology -sweating due to activity. Knowing the person age, weight and 3D coordinates of joints in the body, we deduce the force, the torque, and the energy expenditure during real human movements and apply to an AR human model. We wish to support the physics-physiology AR version, PP-AR, as a BMW surveillance tool for senior home alone (SHA). The functionality is to record senior walking and hand movements inside a home environment. Besides the fringe benefit of enabling more visits from grand children through AR video games, the PP-AR surveillance tool may serve as a means to screen patients in the home for potential falls at points around in house. Moreover, we anticipate PP-AR may help analyze the behavior history of SHA, e.g. enhancing the Smartphone SHA Ubiquitous Care Program, by discovering early symptoms of candidate Alzheimer-like midnight excursions, or Parkinson-like trembling motion for when performing challenging muscular joint movements. Using a set of coordinates corresponding to a set of 3D positions representing human joint locations, we compute the Kinetic Energy (KE) generated by each body segment over time. The Work is then calculated, and converted into calories. Using common graphics rendering pipelines, one could invoke AR technology to provide more information about patients to caretakers. Alerts to caretakers can be prompted by a patient's departure from their personal baseline, and the patient's time ordered joint information can be loaded to a graphics viewer allowing for high-definition digital reconstruction. Then an entire scene can be viewed from any position in virtual space, and AR can display certain measurements values which either constituted an alert, or otherwise indicate signs of the transition from wellness to illness. © 2013 SPIE.","Augmented Reality; Biomedical wellness; Smart sensor networks; Thermodynamics","Biomedical wellness; Digital reconstruction; Energy expenditure; Graphics rendering; High definition; Home environment; Joint information; Surveillance tools; Biological systems; Kinetics; Neural networks; Physiology; Sensor networks; Smart sensors; Thermodynamics; Tools; Augmented reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881111963

Background: Military teams often use game-based simulators on desktop computers to train squad-level procedures. A wearable computer interface that mimics the soldier's equipment was expected to provide better training through increased realism and immersion. Method: A heuristic usability evaluation and two experiments were conducted. Eight evaluators interacted with both wearable and desktop interfaces and completed a usability survey. The first experiment compared the training retention of the wearable interface with a desktop simulator and interactive training video. The second experiment compared the training transfer of the wearable and desktop simulators with a live training environment. Results: Results indicated the wearable interface was more difficult to use and elicited stronger symptoms of simulator sickness. There was no significant difference in training retention between the wearable, desktop, or interactive video training methods. The live training used in the second experiment provided superior training transfer than the simulator conditions, with no difference between the desktop and wearable. Conclusion: The wearable simulator interface did not provide better training than the desktop computer interface. It also had poorer usability and caused worse simulator sickness. Therefore, it was a less effective training tool. Application: This research illustrates the importance of conducting empirical evaluations of novel training technologies. New and innovative technologies are always coveted by users, but new does not always guarantee improvement.","computer interface; simulator; training; training effectiveness; training transfer; usability; wearable simulation interface","Empirical evaluations; Innovative technology; Interactive training; Significant differences; Training effectiveness; usability; Usability evaluation; Wearable interfaces; Experiments; Heuristic methods; Interfaces (computer); Personnel training; Wearable computers; Simulators; adult; article; computer interface; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; equipment design; female; human; learning; male; middle aged; military phenomena; randomized controlled trial; videorecording; Adult; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Science; Transfer (Psychology); User-Computer Interface; Video Recording; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878072143

Learning was measured using a 20-question multiple-choice knowledge assessment pre/post and at 2 months following training. Results were analyzed using the generalized linear model. Independent and paired t tests were used to examine the between- and within-participant differences. The main effect of the virtual simulation was strongly significant (p&.0001).

The heat transfer function and efficacy of glabrous skin is unique within the entire body based on the capacity for a very high rate of blood perfusion and the novel capability for dynamic regulation of blood flow. The model was applied to quantify the absolute and relative contributions of glabrous skin flow to thermoregulation for varying levels of blood perfusion. The model also was used to demonstrate how the unique features of glabrous skin blood flow may be recruited to implement thermal therapeutic procedures.

This study aims to explore medical students' retention of knowledge and skills as well as their proficiency gain after pre-training using a MVW with avatars for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) team training.Methods: Three groups of pre-clinical medical students, n = 30, were assessed and further trained using a high fidelity full-scale medical simulator: Two groups were pre-trained 6 and 18 months before assessment. A reference control group consisting of matched peers had no MVW pre-training. The groups consisted of 8, 12 and 10 subjects, respectively.

This is important as amount of practice directly relates to training efficacy. It is also known that personalized guidance elevates the benefits of training. How to achieve automated guidance, for example to be used in serious games, is a yet unsolved issue. This paper uses the situated Cognitive Engineering method to analyze the operational demands, theoretical foundations and technological opportunities for the design of an automatically directed scenario-based training system (AD-SBT). AD-SBT guides training by selecting scenarios that match the trainee's competency level, by monitoring the training process, and by offering appropriate support. Three instructional principles are used: adapt training to the trainee's cognitive characteristics, strengthen the trainee's will to learn, and foster transfer of learned skills. This paper reports evidence taken from the literature and by means of a use case simulation to validate and verify the presented requirements for AD-SBT and the underlying claims. Results show that the introduced requirements baseline and the resulting design for AD-SBT form a good starting point for future refinement and prototyping.

The structures studied are boron-doped single crystal silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microbridges that are heated by an electrical current. The microbridges are 85 μm wide, 125 μm tall and 5.5 mm long and lie 2 μm above the substrate. The impact of the narrow gap in the gas phase thermal transport is evaluated by operating the devices under various nitrogen gas pressure conditions, ranging from 625 Torr to ∼1 mTorr - spanning the continuum to noncontinuum gas heat transfer regimes. Raman thermometry is used to obtain spatially-resolved temperature measurements along the length of the device under the various operating conditions. The large dopant concentration (∼4 × 1019 cm-3) within the active silicon layer is found to affect the Raman spectrum used for thermometry via Fano-type interactions, resulting in an asymmetric Raman line shape. With large Raman peak asymmetries, use of the Raman line width as the temperature metric is less reliable as it shows decreased sensitivity to temperature. However, the asymmetry itself, when considered as a fitting parameter, was found to be a reliable indicator of sample temperature. The measured device temperatures are compared to finite element simulations of the structures. Noncontinuum gas phase heat transfer effects are incorporated into the continuum simulations via temperature discontinuities at the solid-gas interface, provided by a model developed from noncontinuum simulation results. Additionally, the impact of the large dopant concentrations is incorporated into the thermal models via a modified thermal conductivity model which considers impurity scattering effects on thermal transport. The simulation and experimental results show reasonable agreement.

This shared coding has implications for learning and training of real-world tasks in computer simulated environments (CSE). For instance, more natural sensory-motor contingencies in terms of the controllers or environment display should be expected to more readily tap into existing sensory-motor codes, and thus result in better training transfer. In this research report, we compare a standard mouse controller to a WiiMote controller for performing a simple everyday action-oriented task in a CSE. Users show differences on task performance depending on the type of controller, but more so in the timing of performing the task rather then the accuracy or correctness of task performance. Not surprisingly, users take longer to plan and execute tasks with the WiiMote controller, which we claim has more natural sensory-motor contingencies for our task than a mouse controller and thus trigger user to act with caution in the context of a potentially risky task. We report these differences and discuss implications of the results to training in computer simulated environments, as well as insights into theories of grounded cognition.","Common coding theory; Computer based learning; Grounded cognition; Interaction devices and tools","Action plan; Coding Theory; Computer-based learning; Grounded cognition; Interaction devices; Learning and training; Mouse controller; Real-world task; Research reports; Simulated environment; Simulated trainings; Task performance; Computer programming; Human computer interaction; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864589151

Further, it is well documented that there is an age-related decline in complex perceptual-cognitive processing, which can be reversed with training. It has been suggested that a specific dynamic scene perceptual-cognitive training procedure [the three-dimensional multiple object tracking speed task (3D-MOT)] helps observers manage socially relevant stimuli such as human body movements as seen in crowds or during sports activities. Here, we test this assertion by assessing whether training older observers on 3D-MOT can improve biological motion (BM) perception. Research has shown that healthy older adults require more distance in virtual space between themselves and a point-light walker to integrate BM information than younger adults. Their performances decreased markedly at a distance as far away as 4 m (critical for collision avoidance), whereas performance in young adults remained constant up to 1 m. We trained observers between 64 and 73 years of age on the 3D-MOT speed task and looked at BM perception at 4 and 16 m distances in virtual space. We also had a control group trained on a visual task and a third group without training. The perceptual-cognitive training eliminated the difference in BM perception between 4 and 16 m after only a few weeks, whereas the two control groups showed no transfer. This demonstrates that 3D-MOT training could be a good generic process for helping certain observers deal with socially relevant dynamic scenes. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","aging; biological motion; perceptual-cognitive training; three-dimensional multiple object tracking speed task; transferability","adult; aged; aging; article; biological motion perception; clinical article; cognition; collisionally activated dissociation; controlled study; human; motion analysis system; movement perception; observer variation; perceptual cognitive training; priority journal; sociology; task performance; three dimensional multiple object tracking speed task; velocity; vision; visual stimulation; walking speed; Aged; Aging; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion Perception; Photic Stimulation; Transfer (Psychology); Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861098668

Earlier validation studies have used bronchoscopy simulators, not real-life performance in patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the reliability and validity of an assessment tool aimed for the use in a clinical setting. Methods: Five junior residents, 5 senior residents and 9 consultants performed 3 bronchoscopies each. All 57 bronchoscopies were video-recorded and assessed blindly and independently by two bronchoscopy experts using the new assessment tool. Results: The interrater reliability was high, with Cronbach's α = 0.86. Assessment of 3 bronchoscopies by a single rater had a generalizability coefficient of 0.84. The correlation between experience and performance was good (Pearson correlation = 0.76). There were significant differences between the groups for all aspects of the assessment, but post hoc tests showed different discriminative abilities. Conclusions: This new tool for assessing clinical bronchoscopy performance has a high interrater reliability. One rater assessing performance of 3 bronchoscopies ensures sufficient reliability. The assessment tool demonstrated sufficient construct validity. Copyright © 2011 S.

Immersion is known to effect the quality of training in virtual environments, and the successful transfer of skills to real world situations. However, the level of perceived immersiveness that an environment invokes is an ill defined concept, and effects of different types of immersion are known to have greater and lesser influences on training outcomes. We concentrate on how immersiveness effects perceived risk in virtual environments, and how risk impacts training effectiveness. Simulated risk can invoke an alief of danger in subjects using a virtual environment. Alief is a concept useful in virtual training that describes situations where the person experiencing a simulated scenario knows it is not real, but suspends disbelief (willingly or unwillingly). This suspension of belief (alief can cause the person to experience the same sorts of autonomic reactions as if they were experiencing the situation in real life (for example, think of fear invoked on amusement park rides). Alief of risk or danger has been proposed as one phenomenon that can influence training outcomes, like the experience of immersion, when training in virtual environments. In this paper we present work on developing a low-cost virtual environment for the manipulation of immersion and risk for cognitive studies. In this environment we provide several alternative input modalities, from mouse to Wii remote interactivity, to control a virtual avatar's hand and arm for performing risky every day tasks. Immersion can be manipulated in several ways, as well as the type and risk associated with tasks. Typical tasks include performing kitchen preparation work (using knives or hot items), or wood or metal working tasks (involving manipulation of dangerous tools). This paper describes the development and technologies used to create the virtual environment, and how we vary risk perception and immersion of users for various cognitive tasks. The capabilities and manipulations of immersiveness and risk are presented together with some findings on using Wii motes as input devices in several ways for virtual environments. The paper concludes with some preliminary results of varying perceived risk on cognitive task performance in the developed environment.

Several paradigms are used for BCI, but the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP) stands out as it provides a higher information transfer rate while requiring less training. It is an electroencephalographic response detectable when the user looks at a flickering visual stimulus. This research proposes a novel approach for SSVEP-based BCI controller used here for navigation within a 3D virtual environment. For the first time, the flickering stimuli were integrated into virtual objects as a part of the virtual scene in a more transparent and ecological way. As an example, when navigating inside a virtual natural outdoor scene, we could embed the SSVEP flashes in the wings of virtual butterflies surrounding the user. We could also introduce the use of animated and moving stimulations when using SSVEP-based BCI, as the virtual butterflies were left with the possibility of moving and flying in front of the user. Moreover, users received real-time feedback of their mental activity and were thus aware of their detected SSVEP directly and continuously. An experiment has been conducted to assess the influence of both the feedback and the integrated controller on navigation performance and subjective preference. We found that the usage of a controller integrated within the virtual scene along with the feedback seems to improve subjective preference and feeling of presence, despite reduced performance in terms of speed. This suggests that SSVEP-based BCI interfaces for virtual environments could move on from static targets and use integrated and animated stimuli presented in an ecological way for controls in systems where performance demands could be relaxed to benefit an improvement in interaction naturalness. © 2012 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"3-D virtual environment; Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); Controller-integrated; Human capability; Information transfer rate; Integrated controllers; Mental activity; Navigation performance; Outdoor scenes; Real-time feedback; Steady-state visual-evoked potentials; Virtual objects; Virtual scenes; Virtual worlds; Visual stimulus; Ecology; Flickering; Integration; Interfaces (computer); Virtual reality; Brain computer interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859389226

Yet, recent findings in rodents have challenged the notion that contextual fear retention is initially generalized. The context-specificity of a cued fear memory to the learning context has not been addressed in the human literature largely due to limitations in methodology. Here we adapt a novel technology to test the context-specificity of cued fear conditioning using full immersion 3-D virtual reality (VR). During acquisition training, healthy participants navigated through virtual environments containing dynamic snake and spider conditioned stimuli (CSs), one of which was paired with electrical wrist stimulation. During a 24-h delayed retention test, one group returned to the same context as acquisition training whereas another group experienced the CSs in a novel context. Unconditioned stimulus expectancy ratings were assayed on-line during fear acquisition as an index of contingency awareness. Skin conductance responses time-locked to CS onset were the dependent measure of cued fear, and skin conductance levels during the interstimulus interval were an index of context fear. Findings indicate that early in acquisition training, participants express contingency awareness as well as differential contextual fear, whereas differential cued fear emerged later in acquisition. During the retention test, differential cued fear retention was enhanced in the group who returned to the same context as acquisition training relative to the context shift group. The results extend recent rodent work to illustrate differences in cued and context fear acquisition and the contextual specificity of recent fear memories. Findings support the use of full immersion VR as a novel tool in cognitive neuroscience to bridge rodent models of contextual phenomena underlying human clinical disorders.

Generally speaking, these simulators offer technological sophistication but disregard theory-based design, leaving unanswered the question of what task features should be represented in the simulators. The authors compared real-world training and two alternative virtual trainers, one emphasizing physical fidelity and the other cognitive fidelity of the task.Method: Participants were randomly assigned to one of four training groups in a LEGO assembly task: virtual-physical fidelity, cognitive fidelity, real world, and control. A posttraining test to assess the development of procedural skills was conducted.Results: Both the virtual-physical fidelity and cognitive fidelity training methods produced better performance time than no training at all, as did the real-world training. The cognitive fidelity training was inferior in terms of test time compared to the real-world training, whereas the virtual-physical fidelity training was not. In contrast, only the real-world and the cognitive fidelity groups, and not the virtual-physical fidelity group, required significantly less time than the control group for error correction.Conclusion: The two training methods have complementary advantages.Application: Combining physical fidelity and cognitive training methods can enhance procedural skills acquisition when real-world training is not practicable. © 2011, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","human factors; trainers; transfer of training; virtual reality","Assembly tasks; Cognitive training; Control groups; Simulation-based training; Skills acquisition; Test time; trainers; Training methods; Training simulator; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Simulators; Virtual reality; Mergers and acquisitions; adult; article; audiovisual equipment; clinical trial; comparative study; computer simulation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; learning; male; multivariate analysis; randomized controlled trial; task performance; teaching; Adult; Computer Simulation; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Structural; Multivariate Analysis; Task Performance and Analysis; Transfer (Psychology); Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052983615

The experiences were in the form of two field trips featuring statistically identical wildflower reserves. While the results support that the Real is superior for learning activity, they also show that the Virtual is useful for priming and reinforcing in-curriculum material, or for situations when the real environment is inaccessible.

Research shows that players drawn to the interpersonal dimensions of online games are more prone to experience negative outcomes associated with their computer use. Our study suggests that it is not only whether online gamers seek meaningful social interactions that determine if WoW play becomes problematic, but exactly how players interact with others in online game-worlds. Specifically, levels of problematic WoW play depend on the extent gamers play with offline or 'real-life' friends and relations. Our survey data reveals both a direct relationship between playing WoW with offline friends and problematic online gaming and also an indirect one mediated by 'immersion' (defined as the extent that players feel like they are in a virtual world and in some cases actually their character). Interpreting these results through ethnographic and interview data, we suggest that playing WoW with real-life-friends allows gamers to transfer in-game accomplishments and experiences into offline social networks. Rather than competing and conflicting with the world outside of the game, WoW played in this way tends to enhance gamers' offline lives. Further, by keeping gamers in touch with perspectives outside of WoW, playing with real-life-friends instills critical distance and greater awareness of how excessive play can damage offline commitments and relationships, allowing gamers to better monitor, evaluate, and ultimately regulate excessive game-play. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The method combines an anisotropic solvent representation of the lipid bilayer and universal solvation model, which predicts transfer energies of molecules from water to an arbitrary medium with defined polarity properties. The universal solvation model accounts for hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen-bonding, and electrostatic solute-solvent interactions. The lipid bilayer is represented as a fluid anisotropic environment described by profiles of dielectric constant (ε), solvatochromic dipolarity parameter (π*), and hydrogen bonding acidity and basicity parameters (α and β). The polarity profiles were calculated using published distributions of quasi-molecular segments of lipids determined by neutron and X-ray scattering for DOPC bilayer and spin-labeling data that define concentration of water in the lipid acyl chain region. The model also accounts for the preferential solvation of charges and polar groups by water and includes the effect of the hydrophobic mismatch for transmembrane proteins. The method was tested on calculations of binding energies and preferential positions in membranes for small-molecules, peptides and peripheral membrane proteins that have been experimentally studied. The new theoretical approach was implemented in a new version (2.0) of our PPM program and applied for the large-scale calculations of spatial positions in membranes of more than 1000 peripheral and integral proteins.

Acquisition of such skills prior to performing actual surgery is highly desirable for favorable outcome. Virtual-reality simulators have been developed for both surgical training and assessment of performance. The aim of the current study is to show construct validity of a novel simulator, LapVR (Immersion Medical, San Jose, CA, USA), for Japanese surgeons and surgical residents. Methods Forty-four subjects were divided into the following three groups according to their experience in laparoscopic surgery: 14 residents (RE) with no experience in laparoscopic surgery, 14 junior surgeons (JR) with little experience, and 16 experienced surgeons (EX). All subjects executed ''essential task 1'' programmed in the LapVR, which consists of six tasks, resulting in automatic measurement of 100 parameters indicating various aspects of laparoscopic skills. Results Time required for each task tended to be inversely correlated with experience in laparoscopic surgery. For the peg transfer skill, statistically significant differences were observed between EX and RE in three parameters, including total time and average time taken to complete the procedure and path length for the nondominant hand. For the cutting skill, similar differences were observed between EX and RE in total time, number of unsuccessful cutting attempts, and path length for the nondominant hand. According to the programmed comprehensive evaluation, performance in terms of successful completion of the task and actual experience of the participants in laparoscopic surgery correlated significantly for the peg transfer (P = 0.007) and cutting skills (P = 0.026). Conclusions The peg transfer and cutting skills could best distinguish between EX and RE. This study is the first to provide evidence that LapVR has construct validity to discriminate between novice and experienced laparoscopic surgeons. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Assessment; Laparoscopic surgery; Simulation training; Virtual reality","article; clinical effectiveness; computer simulation; construct validity; controlled study; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; medical student; operation duration; personal experience; priority journal; professional competence; simulator; surgeon; surgical equipment; surgical training; task performance; virtual reality; work experience",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954738642

Accuracy of memory performance per se is an imperfect reflection of the cognitive activity (awareness states) that underlies performance in memory tasks. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of varied visual fidelity of training environments on the transfer of training to the real world after exposure to immersive simulations representing a real-world scene. A between groups experiment was carried out to explore the effect of rendering quality on measurements of location-based recognition memory for objects and associated states of awareness. The immersive simulation consisted of one room that was either rendered flat-shaded or using radiosity rendering. The simulation was displayed on a stereo head-tracked head mounted display. Post exposure to the synthetic simulation, participants completed a memory recognition task conducted in a real-world scene by physically arranging objects in their physical form in a real-world room. Participants also reported one of four states of awareness following object recognition. They were given several options of awareness states that reflected the level of visual mental imagery involved during retrieval, the familiarity of the recollection and related guesses. The scene incorporated objects that ""fitted"" into the specific context of the real-world scene, referred to as consistent objects, and objects that were not related to the specific context of the real-world scene, referred to as inconsistent objects. A follow-up studywas conducted a week after the initial test. Interestingly, results revealed a higher proportion of correct object recognition associated with mental imagery when participants were exposed to low-fidelity flat-shaded training scenes rather than the radiosity rendered ones. Memory psychology indicates that awareness states based on visual imagery require stronger attentional processing in the first instance than those based on familiarity. A tentative claim would, therefore, be that those immersive environments that are distinctive because of their variation from ""real,"" such as flat-shaded environments, recruit stronger attentional resources. This additional attentional processing may bring about a change in participants' subjective experiences of ""remembering"" when they later transfer the training from that environment into a real-world situation. © 2010 ACM.","Human-computer interaction; Perceptual graphics","Cognitive activities; Head mounted displays; Immersive environment; Immersive virtual environments; Perceptual graphics; Real world situations; Subjective experiences; Transfer of trainings; Human computer interaction; Sensory perception; Virtual reality; Object recognition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872409581

However despite the growing popularity of advanced training simulations, methods for evaluating their use rely heavily on subjective measures or analysis of final outcomes. Without dynamic, objective performance measures the outcome of training in terms of impact on cognitive skills and ability to transfer newly acquired skills to the real world is unknown. The relationship between affective intensity and cognitive learning provides a potential new approach to ensure the processing of cognitions which occur prior to final outcomes, such as problem-solving and decision-making, are adequately evaluated.

The control rooms of these power plants are expected to utilize digital instrumentation and controls to a much greater extent than do current plants. The NRC is assessing training facility needs, particularly for control room simulators, which play a central role in NRC training. Simulator fidelity affects both training effectiveness and cost. Research has shown high simulation fidelity sometimes positively affects transfer to the operational environment but sometimes makes no significant difference or actually impedes learning. The conditions in which these different effects occur are often unclear, especially for regulators (as opposed to operators) about whom research is particularly sparse. This project developed an inventory of the tasks and knowledge, skills, and abilities that NRC regulators need to fulfill their job duties. It used expert panels to characterize the inventory items by type and level of cognitive/behavioral capability needed, difficulty to perform, importance to safety, frequency of performance, and the importance of simulator training for learning these capabilities. A survey of current NRC staff provides information about the physical fidelity of the NRC training simulators to the control rooms to which the students were assigned and the effect lack of fidelity had on learning and job performance. The study concludes that a high level of physical fidelity is not required for effective training of NRC staff.","Man-machine interface; Nuclear; Simulator fidelity; Training","Advanced reactors; Different effects; Digital instrumentation; Expert panels; Job performance; Man-machine interface; Nuclear; Operational environments; Simulation fidelity; Simulator fidelity; Simulator training; Training facility; Training simulator; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Control rooms (power plants); Instruments; Man machine systems; Nuclear power plants; Research; Simulators; Personnel training",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958292407

Major advances in medical device design and manufacture currently require extensive and expensive product cycles that include animal and clinical trials. The current design process limits opportunities to thoroughly understand and refine current designs and to explore new high-risk, high-payoff designs. For the past 4 years, our interdisciplinary research group has been working toward developing strategies to dramatically increase the role of simulation in medical device engineering, including linking simulations with visualization and interactive design. Although this vision aligns nicely with the stated goals of the FDA and the increasingly important role that simulation plays in engineering, manufacturing, and science today, the interdisciplinary expertise needed to realize a simulation-based visual design environment for real-world medical device design problems makes implementing (and even generating a system-level design for) such a system extremely challenging. In this paper, we present our vision for a new process of simulation-based medical device engineering and the impact it can have within the field. We also present our experiences developing the initial components of a framework to realize this vision and applying them to improve the design of replacement mechanical heart valves. Relative to commercial software packages and other systems used in engineering research, the vision and framework described are unique in the combined emphasis on 3D user interfaces, ensemble visualization, and incorporating state-of-the-art custom computational fluid dynamics codes. We believe that this holistic conception of simulation-based engineering, including abilities to not just simulate with unprecedented accuracy but also to visualize and interact with simulation results, is critical to making simulation-based engineering practical as a tool for major innovation in medical devices. Beyond the medical device arena, the framework and strategies described may well generalize to simulation-based engineering processes in other domains that also involve simulating, visualizing, and interacting with data that describe spatially complex time-varying phenomena. © 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Fluid dynamics; Heart valve; Human-computer interaction; Mechanical engineering; Medical devices; Simulation; Simulation-based engineering; Visualization","3D user interface; Clinical trial; Commercial software; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Design process; Developing strategy; Engineering process; Expensive products; Heart valve; Immersive virtual reality; Immersive VR; Interactive design; Interdisciplinary research; Mechanical heart valves; Medical device design; Medical Devices; New high; New process; Real-world; Simulation; Simulation result; Simulation-based; System level design; Time varying; Visual design; Biomedical engineering; Computational fluid dynamics; Design; Economic analysis; Fluid dynamics; Fluids; Human computer interaction; Innovation; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Mechanical engineering; Medical problems; User interfaces; Valves (mechanical); Virtual reality; Visualization; Industrial applications; article; biomedical engineering; clinical research; computational fluid dynamics; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; computer program; drug delivery system; food and drug administration; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve regurgitation; heart valve replacement; human; human computer interaction; immersion; medical instrumentation; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; process design; risk assessment; simulation; validation process; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049521962

The proposed method employs example-based machine learning techniques for modeling the space of point spread functions. During an iterative blind deconvolution process, a prior term attracts the point spread function estimates to the learned point spread function space. We demonstrate the usage of this regularizer within a Bayesian blind deconvolution framework and also integrate into the latter a method for noise reduction, thus creating a complete blind deconvolution method. The application of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic and real-world three-dimensional images acquired by a wide-field fluorescence microscope, where the need for blind deconvolution algorithms is indispensable, yielding excellent results. © 2010 IEEE.","Blind deconvolution; deblurring; kernel PCA; machine learning; microscopy; PCA","Blind deconvolution; Deblurring; Kernel PCA; Machine-learning; microscopy; PCA; Algorithms; Convolution; Learning systems; Optical design; Optical transfer function; Three dimensional; Deconvolution; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; Bayes theorem; computer simulation; factual database; fluorescence microscopy; Fourier analysis; image processing; methodology; principal component analysis; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Fourier Analysis; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049529743

Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) suggests that complex visual materials could hinder novice learners from attending to the lesson properly. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that visual complexity correlates with presence and may increase the perceived affective quality of the virtual world, towards an optimal experience or flow. Increasing these in VR applications may promote enjoyment and higher cognitive engagement for better learning outcomes. While visually complex materials could be motivating and pleasing to attend to, would they affect learning adversely? We developed a series of VR presentations to teach second-year psychology students about the navigational behaviour of Cataglyphis ants with flat, cartoon, or lifelike AVAs. To assess learning outcomes, we used Program Ratings, which measured perception of learning and perceived difficulty, and retention and transfer tests. The results from 200 students did not reveal any significant differences in presence, perceived affective quality, or learning outcomes as a function of the AVA's visual complexity. While the results showed positive correlations between presence, perceived affective quality and perception of learning, none of these correlates with perceived difficulty, retention, or transfer scores. Nevertheless, our simulation produced significant improvements on retention and transfer scores in all conditions. We discuss possible explanations and future research directions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Physiopathology of subjective tinnitus remains incompletely explained. Nevertheless, subjective tinnitus is thought to result from hyperactivity and neuroplastic reorganization of cortical and subcortical networks following acoustic deafferentation induced by cochlear or auditory nerve damage. Involvement of both auditory and non-auditory central nervous pathways explains the conscious perception of tinnitus and also the potentially incapacitating discomfort experienced by some patients (sound hypersensitivity, sleep disorders, attention deficit, anxiety or depression). These clinical patterns are similar to those observed in chronic pain following amputation where conditioning techniques using virtual reality have been shown both to be theoretically interesting and effectively useful. This analogy led us to develop an innovative setup with dedicated auditory and visual 3D virtual reality environments in which unilateral subjective tinnitus sufferers are given the possibility to voluntarily manipulate an auditory and visual image of their tinnitus (tinnitus avatar). By doing so, the patients will be able to transfer their subjective auditory perception to the tinnitus avatar and to gain agency on this multimodal virtual percept they hear, see and spatially control. Repeated sessions of such virtual reality immersions are then supposed to contribute to tinnitus treatment by promoting cerebral plasticity. This paper describes the theoretical framework and setup adjustments required by this very first attempt to adapt virtual reality techniques to subjective tinnitus treatment. Therapeutic usefulness will be validated by a further controlled clinical trial. © 2009 The Author(s).","Neuroplasticity; Tinnitus; Virtual reality","3D virtual reality; Adult populations; Attention deficit; Auditory nerves; Auditory perception; Chronic pain; Clinical trial; Developed countries; Multi-modal; Neuroplasticity; Physiopathology; Setup adjustments; Sleep disorders; Theoretical framework; Visual image; Neurophysiology; Three dimensional; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952882596

The influence of immersion time was also analyzed. Electrochemical techniques such as open circuit potential, polarization curves, transient currents and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, complemented with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, were used. Immediately after the immersion in the corrosive media the corrosion resistance was similar for both grain sizes of the AZ31 alloy and higher in NaCl solutions than in PBS. However, this corrosion behaviour was reversed after longer periods of immersion due to the stabilizing of the corrosion products of MgO by P-containing compounds. These P-compounds contribute to a higher level of protection by hindering the aggressive action of chloride ions. The best corrosion behaviour of the AZ31 alloy was obtained for the finest grain alloy associated with the highest transfer resistance value, after long periods of immersion in PBS. © 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.

Compared with pattern classification studies, pattern regression considers the problem of estimating continuous rather than categorical variables, and can be more challenging. It is also clinically important, since it can be used to estimate disease stage and predict clinical progression from images. In this work, adaptive regional feature extraction approach is used along with other common feature extraction methods, and feature selection technique is adopted to produce a small number of discriminative features for optimal regression performance. Then the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is used to build regression models based on selected features. To get stable regression models from limited training samples, a bagging framework is adopted to build ensemble basis regressors derived from multiple bootstrap training samples, and thus to alleviate the effects of outliers as well as facilitate the optimal model parameter selection. Finally, this regression scheme is tested on simulated data and real data via cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that this regression scheme achieves higher estimation accuracy and better generalizing ability than Support Vector Regression (SVR). © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The paper addresses the aforementioned deficiencies by featuring an overview of the technology and algorithms used to calibrate, reconstruct, and render objects in the system. The algorithm produces partial 3D meshes, instead of dense point clouds, which are combined on the renderer to create a unified model of the environment. The chosen representation of the data allows for high compression ratios for transfer to remote sites.

The system can simulate an astronaut's outer space walk by means of manipulating the MMU, and it also can be used as a training environment by taking advantage of virtual reality properties of imagination, interaction, and immersion. As in microgravity space, an astronaut's moving limbs cause changes in the MMU posture; these changes result in great offsets to correct direction and have a great effect on the MMU's manipulation performance. A multibody astronaut model is developed by using relative coordinates according to the motion characteristics of an astronaut equipped with MMU. Motion information on the user's limbs are captured by means of a motion capture subsystem and are mapped to an astronaut in virtual environment to simulate the astronaut's limb motions while the astronaut is navigating in outer space. It is an open-chain system for an astronaut multibody model. As an astronaut can control his limbs, the whole system dynamics is a hybrid forward and inverse dynamic problem. Recursive dynamic formulations of a previous method are introduced to solve the forward dynamic problem. For the inverse dynamic part, because the system can get motion characteristics of parts of the relative coordinates, unknown generalized driving forces are applied on these known relative coordinates. All the unknown generalized driving forces and unknown relative coordinates can be combined in a set of hybrid dynamic formulations based on a forward dynamic formulation. The motion characteristics of an astronaut multibody model can be obtained by solving the hybrid formulations.

This idea is vulnerable to the paradox of fiction, which questions whether it is possible to express genuine emotion toward a character (or event) known to be fictitious. As many of these virtual studies are designed to elicit, broadly speaking, emotional responses through interactions with fictional characters (avatars) or objects/places, the issue raised by the paradox seems particularly apt. This paper assesses the extent to which the paradox of fiction constitutes a legitimate challenge to psychological research within virtual environments, and argues that any alleged conflict is in fact a product of an overly simplistic view of emotions which a more complete understanding resolves. Moreover, through a more detailed analysis of why the paradox cannot be sustained, one finds justification for the claim that emotions elicited through interactions with virtual (fictitious) objects/events are valid. However, their generalizability to the non-virtual world must still be treated with caution. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Affect program; Paradox of fiction; Quasi-emotions; Virtual psychology; Virtual reality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149134346

Although PTSD was only codified in 1980, there has been an increasing interest in this area of research. Unfortunately, relatively little attention has been given to the psychological treatment of motor vehicle accident survivors, which is remarkable because vehicular collisions are deemed the number one cause of PTSD. As the emotional consequences of vehicular collisions prevail, so does the need for more effective treatments. Randomized controlled clinical trials have identified exposure-based therapies as being the most efficacious for extinguishing fears. One type of exposure-based treatment, called virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), provides a safe, controlled, and effective therapeutic alternative that is not dependent on real-life props, situations, or even a person's imagination capabilities. This modality, while relatively new, has been implemented successfully in the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders and may offer a particularly beneficial and intermediary step for the treatment of collision-related PTSD. In particular, VRET combined with physiological monitoring and feedback provides a unique opportunity for individuals to objectively recognize both anxiety and relaxation; learn how to manage their anxiety during difficult, albeit simulated, driving conditions; and then transfer these skills onto real-life roadways. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2010.",,"computer interface; computer simulation; human; life event; methodology; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological aspect; psychotherapy; review; traffic accident; treatment outcome; Accidents, Traffic; Computer Simulation; Humans; Life Change Events; Psychotherapy; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Treatment Outcome; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949693671

The paper describes a policy-making simulation conducted within a virtual world and the results of an analysis conducted to assess its learning effectiveness. Our analysis, drawn from eight 'learning principles' advanced by Gee (2003), indicates that the levels of enthusiasm and learning that take place within a virtual world can differ considerably for different students: while some prefer traditional online methods, others are more enthusiastic about virtual world settings. Of the eight principles we considered, we found evidence to support 'identity and self knowledge', 'active learning', 'psychological moratorium' and 'content' principles. The 'affinity', 'transfer' and 'exploration' principles were not as well supported. In conclusion, we recommend that instructors give serious consideration to using virtual worlds as a tool to support interactive activities of students such as simulations.

Part of this is because of the new learner, a millennial or net generation learner who is time-poor, a networker with strong inclinations towards social or community knowledge pooling and a multiple media literacy which is comfortable in virtual worlds and with visual emphasis. The other element is the perceived changing role of the university or higher education in the transfer of knowledge, moving from a transmission or narrative model to learner-centred and performative approaches. This has been highlighted by greater emphasis on experiential learning methodologies, and the development of action learning practices. The nexus of these two influences, the new learner and the higher education response to delivering learning, may be elaborated further from learning theory which seems to be moving beyond social constructivist approaches, or certainly encompassing what is referred to as connectivism. This may be a new theoretical approach, or it could simply be an organic growth in meeting the needs of large numbers of higher education student participants who perceive a degree as a skills-based workplace preparation. Whatever the theoretical underpinning may be, the large numbers of learners moving to postgraduate coursework or more workplace-oriented programs and subjects has thrown out the challenge to instructional designers to provide just-in-time, relevant and socially transferred learning with strong creative and imaginative engagement. The case studies incorporated in this paper provide two separate approaches to these challenges - one is a workplace-oriented postgraduate team project in a Masters in Communication, the other provides a virtual simulation for developing creative and professional writing skills at postgraduate levels. They both provide perspectives on the net generation learner and collaborative and connected learning models. © 2009 IADIS.","Connectivism; Experiential learning; Neomillennial learners; Net generation; Virtual environments","Connectivism; Experiential learning; Neomillennial learners; Net generation; Virtual environments; Computer science; E-learning; Education computing; Information systems; Learning systems; Teaching; Virtual reality; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955648371

This experimental study examined the effect of learning mode on comprehension of a genomic concept. Methods: 156 individuals aged 18-40 without specialized knowledge were randomly assigned to either a virtual reality active learning or didactic learning condition. The outcome was comprehension (recall, transfer, mental models). Results: Change in recall was greater for didactic learning than for active learning (p < 0.001). Mean transfer and change in mental models were also higher for didactic learning (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Believability was higher for didactic learning (p < 0.05), while ratings for motivation (p < 0.05), interest (p < 0.0001), and enjoyment (p < 0.0001) were higher for active learning, but these variables did not mediate the association between learning mode and comprehension. Conclusion: These results show that learning mode affects comprehension, but additional research is needed regarding how and in what contexts different approaches are best for educating patients about abstract concepts. Practice implications: Didactic, interpersonal health education approaches may be more effective than interactive games in educating patients about abstract, unfamiliar concepts. These findings indicate the importance of traditional health education approaches in emerging areas like genomics.","Genetic communication; Genetics; Learning approaches; Patient education","adult; article; attitude to health; comprehension; controlled study; education program; female; genetic susceptibility; happiness; health education; human; knowledge; learning; male; medical research; motivation; normal human; patient education; priority journal; recall; virtual reality; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Comprehension; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Mental Recall; Models, Educational; Patient Education as Topic; Risk Factors; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350084951

These devices provide the operator with various levels of realism, including haptic (or force) feedback. However, this feature adds significantly to the cost of the devices, and limited data exist assessing the value of haptics in skill acquisition and development. Utilizing the Laparoscopy VR (Immersion Medical, Gaithersburg, MD), we hypothesized that the incorporation of force feedback in the simulated operative environment would allow superior trainee performance compared with performance of the same basic skills tasks in a non-haptic model. Methods: Ten medical students with minimal laparoscopic experience and similar baseline skill levels as proven by performance of two fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) tasks (peg transfer and cutting drills) voluntarily participated in the study. Each performed two tasks, analogous to the FLS drills, on the Laparoscopy VR at 3 levels of difficulty, based on the established settings of the manufacturer. After achieving familiarity with the device and tasks, the students completed the drills both with and without force feedback. Data on completion time, instrument path length, right and left hand errors, and grasping tension were analyzed. The scores in the haptic-enhanced simulation environment were compared with the scores in the non-haptic model and analyzed utilizing Student's t-test. Results: The peg transfer drill showed no difference in performance between the haptic and non-haptic simulations for all metrics at all three levels of difficulty. For the more complex cutting exercise, the time to complete the tasks was significantly shorter when force feedback was provided, at all levels of difficulty (158 ± 56 versus 187 ± 51 s, 176 ± 49 versus 222 ± 68 s, and 275 ± 76 versus 422 ± 220 s, at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, P < 0.05). Data on instrument path length, grasping tension, and errors showed a trend toward a benefit from haptics at all difficulty levels, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Conclusions: In the more advanced tasks, haptics allowed superior precision, resulting in faster completion of tasks and a trend toward fewer technical errors. In the more basic tasks, haptic-enhanced simulation did not demonstrate an appreciable performance improvement among our trainees. These data suggest that the additional expense of haptic-enhanced laparoscopic simulators may be justified for advanced skill development in surgical trainees as simulator technology continues to improve. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Cell culture studies were performed for films with Si contents ranging from ∼4 at.% to 15 at.%. Substantial differences between Si-incorporated and SiOx-incorporated films were found for the bonding environments of Si atoms and the hybridization of underlying carbon structures. However, osteoblast-attachment studies did not show statistically significant trends in properties of cell growth (count, area and morphology) that can be attributed either to the Si content of the films or to the chemical structure of the films. The surface energy decreased by 40% as the Si content of the SiOx incorporated DLC films increased to 13 at.%. The cell adhesion properties however did not change in response to lowering of the surface energy. The incorporation of both Si and SiOx leads to a beneficial reduction in the residual stress of the films. The average roughness of the films increases and the hardness decreases when Si and SiOx are added to DLC films. The impact of these changes for load-bearing biomedical applications can be determined only by carefully controlled experiments using anatomic simulators.

However, there is uncertainty concerning the extent to which such properties might be carried across contexts. In the current study we sought to determine whether conditioning-dependent motivational properties can transfer from a computer game to the real world and, further, whether this conditioning might be expressed in terms of brain responses measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied healthy participants conditioned with aversive and appetitive drinks in the context of a virtual cycling race. Three days after conditioning, participants returned for a fMRI session. We took this opportunity to observe the impact of incidental presentation of conditioned stimuli on a real-world decision (seat choice). We found a significant influence of conditioning on seat choice and, moreover, noted that individual susceptibility to this influence was reflected in differential insula cortex responses during subsequent scanning. The choice was also predicted by participants' personality scores and, as a statistical trend ( p=0.07), by their sense of immersion in the game environment. Our data show that motivational properties of stimuli can transfer from the virtual to the real world. While much concern has been expressed over the impact of virtual experience on general levels of aggression and mood, our data point to another important consideration: the fact that a stimulus in the virtual environment can acquire motivational properties that persist and modify behavior in the real world.

Can cognitive technologies be adapted to benefit both learning specific domains and generalizable transfer? This issue is examined by teaching students complex adaptive systems with computer-based simulations. With a particular emphasis on fostering understanding that transfers to dissimilar phenomena, the studies reported here examine the influence of different descriptions and perceptual instantiations of the scientific principle of competitive specialization. Experiment 1 examines the role of intuitive descriptions to concrete ones, finding that intuitive descriptions leads to enhanced domain-specific learning but also deters transfer. Experiment 2 successfully alleviated these difficulties by combining intuitive descriptions with idealized graphical elements. Experiment 3 demonstrates that idealized graphics are more effective than concrete graphics even when unintuitive descriptions are applied to them. When graphics are concrete, learning and transfer largely depend on the particular description. However, when graphics are idealized, a wider variety of descriptions results in levels of learning and transfer similar to the best combination involving concrete graphics. Although computer-based simulations can be effective for learning that transfers, designing effective simulations requires an understanding of concreteness and idealization in both the graphical interface and its description. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Abstraction; Analogy; Complex systems; Concreteness; Generalization; Grounded learning; Learning; Science education; Simulation; Transfer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047683161

The present model was simulated using the software (Wintherm 8.0, Thermoanalytics, USA) for different body segments to predict the heat flow between body core and skin surface with changes in environmental temperature with fixed relative humidity and wind velocity. The simulated model for comparative study of internal temperature distribution of hand, arm, leg and feet segments yielded remarkably good results and observed to be in trends with previously cited work under ambient environmental condition and at controlled room temperature.

The final aim of the project is to create a highly accurate Virtual Reality (VR) model of this unique archaeological site, capable of providing not only visual but also acoustic immersion based on its actual geometry and physical properties. The project started in May 2006 with in situ data acquisition. The 3D geometry of the chamber was captured using a Laser Range Finder. In order to combine the different scans into a complete 3D visual model, reconstruction software based on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm was developed using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). This software computes the boundaries of the room on a 3D uniform grid and populates its interior with ""free-space nodes"", through an iterative algorithm operating like a torchlight illuminating a dark room. The envelope of the resulting set of ""free-space nodes"" is used to generate a 3D iso-surface approximating the interior shape of the chamber. Each polygon of this surface is then assigned the acoustic absorption coefficient of the corresponding boundary material. A 3D audiovisual model operating in real-time was developed for a VR Environment comprising head-mounted display (HMD) I-glasses SVGAPro, an orientation sensor (tracker) InterTrax 2 with 3 Degrees Of Freedom (3DOF) and stereo headphones. The auralisation software is based on a geometric model. This constitutes a first approach, since geometric acoustics have well-known limitations in rooms with irregular surfaces. The immediate advantage lies in their inherent computational efficiency, which allows real-time operation. The program computes the early reflections forming the initial part of the chamber's impulse response (IR), which carry the most significant cues for source localisation. These early reflections are processed through Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTF) updated in real-time according to the orientation of the user's head, so that sound waves appear to come from the correct location in space, in agreement with the visual scene. The late-reverberation tail of the IR is generated by an algorithm designed to match the reverberation time of the chamber, calculated from the actual acoustic absorption coefficients of its surfaces. The sound output to the headphones is obtained by convolving the IR with anechoic recordings of the virtual audio source. © 2008 SPIE-IS&T.","3D acquisition; Augmented reality; Auralisation; Laser range finder; Virtual reality","Absorption; Acoustic wave absorption; Acoustics; Architectural acoustics; Audio acoustics; Computational efficiency; Display devices; Energy absorption; Functions; Headphones; Helmet mounted displays; Image reconstruction; Imaging systems; Impulse response; Lasers; Loudspeakers; Medical imaging; Mergers and acquisitions; Range finders; Range finding; Reflection; Restoration; Reverberation; Surfaces; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; 3D acquisition; 3D geometries; 3D reconstructions; 3d visual models; Acoustic absorption coefficients; Archaeological sites; Audio sources; Audio visuals; Augmented reality; Auralisation; Dark rooms; Geometric acoustics; Geometric models; Head Related Transfer Functions; In-situ; Irregular surfaces; Iterative algorithms; Iterative Closest points; Laser range finder; Orientation sensors; Reconstruction softwares; Reverberation times; Software computes; Sound waves; Source localisation; Stereo headphones; Uniform grids; Visual scenes; Visualization toolkits; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949110073

The method takes account of the main nonlinear terms in the rolling equation which stabilize parametric rolling, including the nonlinear shape of the righting arm curve, nonlinear damping and cross coupling among all 6 degrees of freedom. For the heave, pitch, sway and yaw motions, the method uses response amplitude operators determined by means of the strip method, whereas the roll and surge motions of the ship are simulated, using nonlinear motion equations coupled with the other 4 degrees of freedom. For computing righting arms in seaways, Grim's effective wave concept is used. Using these transfer functions of effective wave together with the heave and pitch transfer functions, the mean ship immersion, its trim and the effective regular wave height are computed for every time step during the simulation. The righting arm is interpolated from tables, computed before starting the simulation, depending on these three quantities and the heel angle. The nonlinear damping moment and the effect of bilge keels are also taken into account. The numerical simulation tool has shown to be able to model the basic mechanism of parametric rolling motions. Some main characteristics of parametric rolling of ships in a seaway can be good reproduced by means of the method. Comprehensive parametric analyses on parametric rolling amplitude in regular waves have been carried out, with that the complicated parametric rolling phenomena can be understood better. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Unwanted rotational inertia! loads felt by the user are minimized while compliant constraints have been tailored to provide natural feedback forces. These ergonomic forces enhance the experience of virtual motion by partially substituting for the missing real-world dynamic loads encountered in locomotion.

Virtual training environments (VTEs) can deliver stress exposure training to improve the decision-making skills of train drivers. Higher levels of recallable knowledge in the real world have been linked directly to the degree to which trainees have been engrossed in their VTE, an experience often measured through the concept of ""presence."" This paper reports on the use of presence to guide improvements to a VTE developed to deliver driver training in degraded track conditions. Two surveys were used to collect data on train drivers' introspective feedback on the level of presence created by the virtual rail environment and the simulator's effectiveness in generating immersion across a range of presence causal factors. Results indicate that using presence to investigate VTEs has practical significance.

It was found that the effect of the tolerances is highly sensitive on the nature of the manoeuvre flown and that in some cases negative transfer of training may be induced by the tolerances. An investigation on the effect vertical thermal disturbances on a forced landing manoeuvre was also carried out. The results show that the vertical disturbances are highly sensitive to the nature of the manoeuvre flown and they are therefore important to flight simulation. This analysis demonstrates the importance of analyses of vertical disturbances to flight simulation and the consideration of such requirements within the context of particular manoeuvres to be flown, as in some cases, negative transfer of training may be induced by the vertical disturbances. The vertical disturbances sensitivity analysis shows that a simulator may incur significant errors in the task of handling an engine failure after takeoff for a single engine aircraft. This raises the question of the ability to use simulators to train pilots aptly for engine failure after take-off using the tolerances as specified in current regulations since the resultant errors are manoeuvre dependent. A forced landing trajectory optimisation was carried out using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Simulations were carried out for a time averaged thermal disturbances at three test locations. The results show that certain pre-selected touchdown locations are more susceptible to horizontal wind. The results for the forced landing manoeuvre to a pre-selected location found results with minimal distance error.","Forced landing; Genetic algorithm; Transfer of training","Computer simulation; Error analysis; Fits and tolerances; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Training aircraft; Forced landing; Negative transfer; Thermal disturbances; Flight dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547559918

This finding is believed to be due to the more immersive nature of large displays. In our experiment, we examined if using a large display to learn a virtual environment (VE) would improve egocentric knowledge of the target locations. Participants learned the location of five targets by freely exploring a desktop large-scale VE of a city on either a small (25'' diagonally) or large (72'' diagonally) screen. Viewing distance was adjusted so that both displays subtended the same viewing angle. Knowledge of the environment was then assessed using a head-mounted display in virtual reality, by asking participants to stand at each target and paint at the other unseen targets. Angular pointing error was significantly lower when the environment was learned on a 72'' display. Our results suggest that large displays are superior for learning a virtual environment and the advantages of learning an environment on a large display may transfer to navigation in the real world.

The nucleate boiling on a horizontal heating surface with twin nucleation sites has been considered. The heat fluxes absorbed from the heating surface have been calculated for microlayer evaporation, natural convection and transient heat transfer. The impact of stochastic processes of activation and deactivation of the nucleation sites on the dynamic properties of heating surface temperature fluctuation has been evaluated. Non linear methods of data analysis have been applied to the analysis of changes of the heating surface temperature. It has been shown that models containing stochastic procedures are more similar to real behaviors of boiling in comparison to models without stochastic procedures.",,"Cavity interactions; Deterministic models; Dynamic property; Heating surfaces; Microlayer evaporation; Non-linear methods; Nucleation sites; Stochastic procedure; Transient heat transfer; Atmospheric temperature; Computer simulation; Computer software; Nucleate boiling; Nucleation; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Surface properties; Stochastic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870537225

If stuttering manifests itself in VREs similarly to the way it manifests itself in real world interactions, then VREs can provide a controlled, safe, and confidential method for treatment practice and generalization. Though many researchers and clinicians recognize the need for generalization activities in the treatment of stuttering, achieving generalization in a clinical setting poses challenges to client confidentiality, safety, and the efficient use of a professionals' time. Virtual reality (VR) technology may allow professionals the opportunity to enhance and assess treatment generalization while protecting the safety and confidentiality of their clients. In this study, we developed a VR job interview environment which allowed experimental control over communication style and gender of interviewers. In this first trial, persons who stutter (PWS) experienced both challenging and supportive VR job interview conditions. The percentage of stuttered syllables was calculated for both interviews for each participant. Self-reported ratings of communication apprehension and confidence were also obtained, and were not significantly correlated with stuttering severity. Results indicated that interviewer communication style affected the amount of stuttering produced by participants, with more stuttering observed during challenging virtual interviews. Additionally, the amount of stuttering observed during the VR job interviews was significantly, positively correlated with the amount of stuttering observed during an interview with the investigator prior to VR exposure. Participants' subjective reports of the VR experience indicate reactions similar to those they report experiencing in the real world. Possible implications for the use of VR in the assessment and treatment of stuttering are discussed. Educational objectives: After reading this article, the reader will be able to-(1) list some of the challenges to treatment generalization; (2) describe how virtual reality technology can assist in alleviating some of these challenges; (3) describe how the frequency of stuttering varies across two different virtual environments. © 2006.","Adults; Software validation; Stuttering; Virtual reality","adult; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; experience; exposure; female; human; job interview; male; self report; stuttering; verbal communication; virtual reality; Adult; Environment; Female; Humans; Interviews; Job Application; Male; Middle Aged; Stuttering; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750607887

It has been shown that depending on distance between cavities the process of bubbles departure from twin cavity can synchronize and create the unified conditions for heat transfer around the cavities. It has been found that synchronization of interacting cavities leads to decrease in mean frequency of bubbles departure. The new concept of promotion or inhibition of interacting cavities has been defined based on the wavelet analysis. Two-dimensional boiling field was approximated and modeled using CML method. Two mechanisms of interaction between bubble columns have been considered: the thermal and hydrodynamic ones. The simulation shows that thermal interaction between two cavities and bubble columns leads to deactivation of neighboring cavity whereas the hydrodynamic interaction sustains the activity of neighboring cavity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The principles of human perception guide important development of algorithms and techniques in collaboration, graphical, auditory, and haptic rendering. We aim to show how human perception is exploited to achieve realism in high fidelity environments within the constraints of available finite computational resources. In this course we address the challenges faced when building such high-fidelity engaging shared virtual environments, especially those that facilitate collaboration and intuitive interaction. We present real applications in which such high-fidelity is essential. With reference to these, we illustrate the significant need for the combination of high-fidelity graphics in real time, better modes of interaction, and appropriate collaboration strategies. After introducing the concept of high-fidelity virtual environments and why these convey important information to the user, we cover the main issues in two parts linked by the common thread of exploiting human perception. First we explore perceptually driven techniques that can be employed to achieve high-fidelity graphical rendering in real-time, and how incorporating authentic lighting effects helps to convey a sense of realism and scale in virtual re-constructions of historical sites. Secondly, we examine how intuitive interaction between participants, and with objects in the environment, also plays a key role in the overall experience. How perceptual methods can be used to guide interest management and distribution choices, is considered with an emphasis on avoiding potential pitfalls when distributing physically-based simulations. An analysis of real network conditions and the implications of these for distribution strategies that facilitate collaboration is presented. Furthermore, we describe technologies necessary to provide intuitive interaction in virtual environments, paying particular attention to engaging multiple sensory modalities, primarily through physically-based sound simulation and perceptually high-fidelity haptic interaction. The combination of realism and intuitive compelling interaction can lead to engaging virtual environments capable of exhibiting skills transfer, an illusive goal of many virtual environment applications.","Collaborative environments; Haptics; High-fidelity rendering; Human-computer interaction; Multi-user; Networked applications; Perception; Virtual reality","Computer graphics; Curricula; Distributed computer systems; Haptic interfaces; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Sensory perception; Virtual addresses; Collaborative environments; Haptics; High-fidelity renderings; Multi-user; Networked applications; Virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961784838

This paper presents a new colonoscopy training simulator to help trainees practice and acquire the necessary skills and experiences with no risk to the patients and possibly less cost. The simulator includes a specialized haptic interface to transfer force feedback through a long and flexible tube, and graphics algorithms to display the virtual colon realistically while managing the large number of polygons. A new 2-d.o.f. haptic device with folding guides is developed to transmit large decoupled forces of the colonoscopy simulation to the user. The physicians apply a jiggling motion to the colonoscopy tube to advance the scope. This jiggling is an important skill of colonoscopy and is incorporated for the first time by using the new sensor mechanism. A colonoscope handle that shares the look, feel and functions with an actual colonoscope is developed with the necessary electronics inside. The simulator contains controllers to compensate for the inertia and friction effects, and is evaluated by physicians. New graphics algorithms including polygon reduction, navigation and collision detection are developed to compute the deformation and the corresponding reflective force in real-time.","Colonoscopy; Haptic interface; Haptics; Medical simulation; Virtual reality","Computer graphics; Feedback; Sensors; Simulators; Virtual reality; Colonoscopy; Graphics algorithms; Haptics; Medical simulation; Haptic interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646005247

There have been impressive advances in endoscopic procedures during recent years, and there is an emerging trend that the number of procedures is increasing in parallel with these. In addition, the introduction of screening programs for colorectal cancer will also increase the numbers of procedures needed. Recent developments in medical simulation seem promising with regard to the possibility of ""training out"" undesirable parts of the learning curve outside the operating room. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of the AccuTouch flexible endoscopy simulator improves the early part of the learning curve in colonoscopy training. Method: 12 endoscopy trainees, 10 surgeons and two medical gastroenterologists, all with experience in gastroscopy but with no specific colonoscopy experience, were randomly assigned to either simulator training or to a control group. They all received the same theoretical study package and the training group practiced with the AccuTouch colonoscopy simulator until a predefined expert level of performance was reached. All trainees performed their first ten individual colonoscopies described in detail in a separate protocol. Results: Trainees in the simulator-trained group performed significantly better (P = 0.0011) and managed to reach the cecum in 52% of their cases (vs. 19% in the control group), and were 4.53 times more likely to succeed compared with the controls. Additionally, there was a significantly shorter procedure time and less patient discomfort in the hands of the simulator-trained group. Conclusion: Skills acquired using the AccuTouch simulator transfer well into the clinical colonoscopy environment. The results of this trial clearly support the plan to integrate simulator training into endoscopic education curricula. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.",,"article; clinical practice; clinical protocol; clinical trial; colonoscopy; competence; computer simulation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; digestive system cancer; education program; enteritis; experience; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; gastrointestinal polyposis; gastroscopy; human; irritable colon; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical specialist; medical student; performance; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; simulator; theoretical study; virtual reality; Adult; Clinical Competence; Colonic Diseases; Colonography, Computed Tomographic; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Forecasting; Gastroenterology; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Patient Simulation; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28844458846

To do this, we generalize the concept of scalar Zernike aberrations to Jones-Zernike aberrations by expansion of the Jones pupil into vector polynomials. The resulting method is non-paraxial, i.e., the effect of the polarization-dependent contrast loss for high numerical apertures is included. The aberrations of the Jones matrix pupil are a suitable tool to identify the main drivers determining polarization performance. Furthermore, they enable us to compare the polarized and unpolarized performance of such a characterized lithographic System. © 2005 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Aberrations; Hypernumerical aperture imaging; Lithography; Polarization; Zernike polynomials","Hypernumerical aperture imaging; Jones pupil approach; Scalar Zernike aberrations; Zernike polynomials; Aberrations; Computer simulation; Lithography; Optical systems; Polarization; Polynomials; Imaging systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644761193

Currently used actuators, such as shaking motor, have also technological and methodological restrictions. We designed a vibro-tactile pen and software to create tactons and semantic sequences of vibro-tactile patterns on mobile devices (iPAQ pocket PC). We proposed special games and techniques to simplify learning and manipulating vibro-tactile patterns. The technique for manipulating vibro-tactile sequences is based on gesture recognition and spatial-temporal mapping for imaging vibro-tactile signals.

Mask costs, yields and representation of the mask on wafer are important factors to consider. Mask-less E-beam lithography is being considered, but major manufacturing is still done by scanner technology. Therefore the same emphasis on modeling applied in the 1990's on the wafer is now being applied to mask technologies to drive down costs, improve yields and to develop viable mask to wafer transfer patterns. Yield is ultimately connected to process latitude, which is limited by a variety of electron-material interaction issues. As in the optical world, the question is how to maximize the process window considering all the systematic and statistical error sources. Simulation can be used to find out the magnitude of yield limiting effects, and to evaluate the contributing error sources such as PEC file contributions. Film stacks are now becoming an important contributor to statistical error due to technologies such as tri-tone attenuated masks that place a thin layer of chrome over MoSi. In this paper we will compare the SELID E-beam simulation to cross-sections of line-space and contact patterns. Demonstrations of simulation to real data and the use of simulation to further evaluate process window to enhance the learning mode during development cycles will be presented.","E-beam lithography; Lithography modeling; Process control; Simulation","Attenuation; Computer simulation; Error analysis; Process control; Scanning; Semiconductor device manufacture; Statistical methods; Cross-sections; Lithography modeling; Scanners; Water transfer patterns; Electron beam lithography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19844367715

In recent years, virtual reality technologies have begun to be used as an assessment and treatment tool in occupational therapy, in part because of the ability to create environments that provide patients with opportunities to engage in meaningful, purposeful tasks that are related to real-life interests and activities. The objective of this study was to determine the suitability and feasibility of using a PC-based, non-immersive, VR system (that is, a system in which the user has a reduced sense of actual presence in and control over the simulated environment) for training individuals with unilateral spatial neglect to cross streets in a safe and vigilant manner. A virtual environment, consisting of a typical city street, was programmed using Superscape's™ 3D-Webmaster, a 3D web-authoring tool. Twelve subjects, aged 55 to 75 years, participated in the initial feasibility study and, to date, a further eight subjects have participated in the intervention study. Six of the initial subjects and all eight of the intervention subjects had sustained a right hemispheric stroke at least 6 weeks prior to the study. The remaining subjects were healthy age-matched adults who were independently mobile and had no difficulty in crossing streets. The results show that this virtual environment was suitable in both its cognitive and motor demands for the targeted population and indicate that the virtual reality training is likely to prove beneficial to people who have difficulty with crossing streets. The generalizability of these results, and recommendations regarding the use of virtual reality as an occupational therapy intervention, must be substantiated by further studies using a range of VR platforms with people with different cognitive and motor disabilities.","Stroke rehabilitation; Unilateral spatial neglect; Virtual reality","adult; aged; alertness; article; automation; body equilibrium; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; computer interface; computer program; controlled study; daily life activity; depth perception; disorientation; environmental planning; equipment design; feasibility study; female; human; Internet; male; mass medium; medical technology; mobilization; motor coordination; motor dysfunction; motor performance; nausea; occupational therapy; pathophysiology; right hemisphere; safety; stroke; traffic accident; training; urban area; virtual reality; visual impairment; walking; Accidents, Traffic; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Cerebrovascular Accident; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Space Perception; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038441657

PC-based virtual environments are probably better suited for this purpose than more immersive virtual environments because they are relatively inexpensive and portable, and less frightening to patients. Those exploratory studies that have so far been performed indicate that VR involvement would be usefully directed towards improving assessments of memory impairments and in memory remediation using reorganization techniques. In memory assessment, the use of VR could provide more comprehensive, ecologically-valid, and controlled evaluations of prospective, incidental, and spatial memory in a rehabilitation setting than is possible using standardized assessment tests. The additional knowledge gained from these assessments could more effectively direct rehabilitation towards specific impairments of individual patients. In memory remediation, VR training has been found to promote procedural learning in people with memory impairments, and this learning has been found to transfer to improved real-world performance. Future research should investigate ways in which the procedural knowledge gained during VR interaction can be adapted to offset the many disabilities which result from different forms of memory impairment.","Memory; Rehabilitation; Virtual reality","article; cognition; computer system; cost benefit analysis; evaluation; human; learning; memory disorder; mental deficiency; spatial memory; technique; treatment outcome; validation process; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037810473

To date, most VR-based training systems have been situation based, but this paper examines the utility of VR for a different class of training: learning to execute exact motions, which are often required in sports and the arts. In this paper, we propose an interaction method, called Just Follow Me (JFM), that uses an intuitive ""ghost"" metaphor and a first-person viewpoint for effective motion training. Using the ghost metaphor (GM), JFM visualizes the motion of the trainer in real time as a ghost (initially superimposed on the trainee) that emerges from one's own body. The trainee who observes the motion from the first-person viewpoint ""follows"" the ghostly master as closely as possible to learn the motion. Our basic hypothesis is that such a VR system can help a student learn motion effectively and quickly, comparably to the indirect real-world teaching methods.

Using the XCOSM package, we show first with simulations and then with recorded data that it is possible to recover from an experimental PSF some parameters, which are very difficult or impossible to measure during the acquisition, like the specimen depth or the immersion medium refractive index. Doing so, we can precise the acquisition protocol, which helps to use the instrument under optimal conditions. Furthermore, the knowledge of the actual acquisition conditions permits to use for the deconvolution process a computed PSF, which is noiseless and as close as possible to the actual PSF.

We hypothesized that this cardiovascular deconditioning and reduction of exercise capacity could be prevented by a daily 1 hr centrifugation at +2 Gz. To test this hypothesis, twenty healthy male subjects, underwent 4 day of 6° head-down-tilt bed rest. Ten of them were exposed to a +2 Gz load for up to 30 min twice per day (the Gz group). The remaining 10 were not exposed to a Gz load (the no-Gz group). We estimated autonomic cardiovascular control by power spectral analysis of blood pressure and R-R interval variability, and baroreflex regulation by the transfer function analysis and the sequence method, before and after bed rest. Further, we measured hematocrit as an index of changes in plasma volume and maximal oxygen consumption as an index of exercise capacity, before and after bed rest. Result: In the no-Gz group, heart rate increased after bed rest. The high frequency power of R-R interval variability as an index of cardiac parasympathetic nervous activity, baroreflex gains estimated by transfer function analysis and the sequence method as index of the integrated arterial-cardiac baroreflex function decreased significantly. Associated with these changes, the ratio of low to high frequency power of R-R as an indicator of cardiac sympathovagal balance tended to increase after bed rest in the no-Gz group, However, those showed no significant changes after bed rest in the Gz group. Hematocrit increased after bed rest in the no-Gz group. It also tended to increase in the Gz group, however it did not achieve statistical significance. Maximal oxygen consumption decreased significantly to similar extent in both the groups. Conclusion: This result suggested that 1) a daily 1hr +2Gz load produced by a centrifuge might eliminate the changes in autonomic cardiovascular control during simulated weightlessness; 2) furthermore, it might partly reverse hypovolemia induced by bed rest; 3) however, it could not prevent the decreases in exercise capacity. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The methodology presented in this study focuses on real versus simulated virtual worlds comparing participants' level of presence task performance and cognition state employed to complete a memory task. A 15-minute seminar was presented in four different conditions including real 3D desktop 3D Head Mounted Display (HMD) and Audio-only (between-subjects design). Four independent groups of 18 participants took part in the experiment which investigated the effects of levels of immersion on participants' memory recall and memory awareness state (relevant to episodic and semantic memory types) as well as on their perception of the experimental space and sense of presence for every condition.

Advancements in this type of immersive information technology could produce tools that enhance the scientific study of human cognitive/functional processes and improve our capacity to more accurately assess and treat impairments found in persons with central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Through the creation of dynamic three-dimensional (3D) stimulus environments, in which all behavioral responding can be recorded, VE technology offers the possibility to more sensitively address a range of age-related CNS disorders including Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, and stroke. Advances in this area could impact quality of life issues for an increasingly aging world population. The VE Laboratory at the University of Southern California has developed a suite of ImmersaDesk-format, 3D projection-based VEs. These scenarios target assessment of visuospatial skills including visual field-specific reaction time, depth perception, 3D field dependency (virtual rod and frame test), static and dynamic manual target tracking in 3D space, and spatial rotation. The current project tested healthy older adults (ages of 65 and 92). Participants were administered a standard neuropsychological battery and a suite of VE-delivered visuospatial tasks. Issues addressed in this project include: the occurrence of VE-related side effects in healthy older adults; the relationship between performance on VE measures and standard neuropsychological tests; the assessment of gender specific performance differences; the relationship between immersive tendencies, presence ratings, and VE performance in older adults; learning and generalization; and VE visuospatial performance differences between younger and older participants. This article will address the motivation, rationale, and relevant issues for use of VEs with older adults. A description of our VE system/methodology in the context of a recent study targeting assessment and possible rehabilitation of visuospatial skills with this population will then be detailed.",,"Alzheimer disease; central nervous system; conference paper; depth perception; information; neuropsychological test; psychologic assessment; rating scale; reaction time; virtual reality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033922544

We have found that a Virtual Reality (VR) representation of an ATM network can prove to be an enabling vehicle from which students can readily learn about transmission networks and the concepts of ATM. The students' learning process is readily enforced by their enjoyment of learning - this includes the exploration of the many nooks, and crannies, in the various layers present in the VR representation of the ATM network. VR has also proved to be equally successful at enabling a further understanding of the concepts, and various topologies, of Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).

With the aid of specially designed transducers and sensors, users interact with displayed images, moving and manipulating virtual objects, and performing other actions in a way that engenders a feeling of actual presence (immersion) in the simulated environment. The unique features and flexibility of VR give it extraordinary potential for use in work-related applications. It permits users to experience and interact with a life-like model or environment, in safety and at convenient times, while providing a degree of control over the simulation that is usually not possible in the real-life situation. The work-related applications that appear to be most promising are those that employ virtual reality for visualization and representation, distance communication and education, hands-on training, and orientation and navigation.

Therefore, data from 5 subjects who completed the protocol in rain and control conditions were used to describe the general pattern of response. During the 1st h of walking, core temperature rose 1°C to 38.1°C. The subsequent 2 h of rain caused substantial cold stress, indicated by a 40% increase in heat production due to shivering and significant loss of strength and manual dexterity. However, core temperature only decreased to 37.1°C, merely eliminating the initial exercise hyperthermia. Over the last 2 h of rain, core temperature remained relatively stable at 36.8°C, decreasing slightly to 36.4°C by 5 h. Two other subjects developed significant hypothermia (35°C). One demonstrated fatigue of shivering after 2.5 h of rain, confirming the exhaustion hypothesis of wet- cold hypothermia. The other cooled rapidly when he failed to maintain the walking pace. We conclude that if a person can tolerate the intense discomfort of prolonged wet-cold exposure, he or she has the potential to resist significant core hypothermia for at least 4 h of walking under the conditions of this experiment. Exceptions to this generalization occur, making exposure of <4 h a hypothermia risk for some individuals. Exposures >4 h would involve increasing probability of rapid decline into hypothermia, associated with exhaustion of shivering and exercise heat production.","metabolic rate; recreation safety; shivering; temperature regulation","rain; adult; article; cold exposure; exercise; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; hypothermia; male; motor performance; normal human; priority journal; shivering; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029737497

Five reported a decrease during their third second immersion, and 13 reported a decrease during their fourth immersion. Although some participants did report an increase in malaise, whilst others reported no change, the decrease in reported symptoms from the first immersion to the fourth was none the less quite pronounced. Over half of the participants ceased to report symptoms, and reports of nausea became very low. There was very little change in the pattern of reported symptoms between the second and third immersions, but quite marked changes between the first and second immersions and between the third and fourth immersions. © 1995.","adaptation; immersion; virtual reality","Display devices; Health hazards; Health risks; Risk perception; Societies and institutions; Technology transfer; Immersion adaptation; Malaise; Side effects; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029333228

A special device was developed in our laboratory to transfer prolonged 'dry' water immersion (a technique that has been used for training astronauts under hypogravic conditions) to six Sprague-Dawley test rats (immersion-G group). The time course of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, urinary output, and body weight was monitored from weaning to maturity and then compared with those responses from six sex- and age-matched Sprague-Dawley rats grown in a gravity environment (group G). A downward shift in systolic blood pressure and body weight maturation curves was observed in immersion-G rats from the age of 60 days. Cessation of dry water immersion produced a gradual, significant rise in systolic blood pressure but not in body weight to control values. No marked changes in heart rate and urinary output between G and immersion-G rats were noticed throughout the investigation. Our results provide indirect evidence that an interference in the natural history of blood pressure maturation was introduced by immersion, which dissociated the effects of body weight increase during growth from the effects of ageing per se. It is concluded that the physiological increase in systolic blood pressure during growth is partly gravity-dependent.","blood pressure; gravity; immersion; Sprague-Dawley rats; urine; weightlessness","aging; animal experiment; article; blood pressure; body growth; body weight; controlled study; device; heart rate; hydrostatic pressure; microgravity; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; systolic blood pressure; urine volume; water immersion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026631043

The model consisted of a slab of tissue, covered on both sides with skin. The only active mechanism was the skin blood flow. The blood flow was controlled by body core temperature, mean skin temperature, and local hand temperature. The blood flowed along the palm before returning via the back of the hand. The control function was adapted from an earlier study, dealing with feet, but enhanced with a cold induced vasodilatation term. The palm of the hand was touching materials that were specified by conductivity and heat capacity. The hand was initially at a steady-state in a neutral environment and then suddenly grabbed the material. The resulting cooling curves have been compared to data from an experiment including six materials (foam, wood, nylon, steel, aluminium and metal at a constant temperature), three temperatures (-10, 0, and 10° C), two thermal states of the body (neutral and 0.4°C raised), and with and without gloves. There was a fair general agreement between the model and the experiment but the model failed to predict three specific effects: the unequal effect of equal 10° C steps in cold surface temperature on the temperature of the palm of the hand, the cooling effect of nylon, and the rapid drop in back of the hand temperature. Nevertheless the overall regression was 0.88 with a standard deviation between model and experiment of about 2.5°C. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Heat transfer; Mathematical model; Skin temperature","aluminum; metal; nylon; polyurethan foam; steel; analytic method; article; cold; cold sensation; cooling; core temperature; glove; hand; heat transfer; materials; mathematical model; priority journal; simulation; skin blood flow; skin temperature; wood; Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Cold; Hand; Human; Models, Biological; Skin; Skin Physiology; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026763278

Accurate monitoring of hand temperature did not seem necessarily advantagous as an influence on pain tolerance. It appears merely watching a monitor, regardless of the specific contents of the screen, resulted in longer hand immersion times when compared to no monitor. The monitors seem to serve as distractors and specificity of physiological information was not particularly useful. However, neither information nor physiological monitoring emerged as the primary influence on pain tolerance in this study. Instead, the strongest predictors found were motivation and self-efficacy. The subject's own self prediction of anticipated performance with cold induced pain was closely consistent with actual performance. Although these results alone may not generalize to extended field situations, this study does reinforce the general findings of previous research: namely Bandura's (10) evidence on self-efficacy. While it is obvious cold temperatures have measurable physiological consequences, the experience of pain is also psychologically mediated. Pain associated with cold injury and frostbite in hospital studies show personality correlates are significantly related to the frequency, severity and tragedy of subsequent results (15). A replication of this study will include male subjects even though it is anticipated that findings will be consistent, with perhaps longer immersion times. Future research may want to develop training strategies aimed at teaching self-efficacy and realistic expectations of potential consequences in cold environments rather than scare tactics regarding physiological and psychological cold pain tolerance.",,"article; clinical trial; cognition; cold; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; pain; psychological aspect; psychophysiology; randomized controlled trial; Biofeedback (Psychology); Cognition; Cold; Female; Humans; Pain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026411759

Strips are developed at room temperature after spraying with a ninhydrin-pyridine-acetone solution. Individual amino acids are identified by their migration rates relative to that of glutamine, their color development with the ninhydrin-pyridine solution, and, if necessary, by other specific staining reactions. In clinical use the method has demonstrated the presence of cystinuria in 9 patients and generalized aminoaciduria in 12 others. In addition, it has been used to screen 31 members of an adult Fanconi Kinship.

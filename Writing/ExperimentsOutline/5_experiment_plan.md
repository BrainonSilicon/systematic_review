# Experiment(s) Plan

Pilot study
- provide insight into
    - how long it takes to learn
    - learning plateaus
        - if it is possible to overcome those plateaus
    - effect size
    - refine the schedule (spacing) and trials required if that is needed


Pilot study
T T S \ M W F S \ T T S \ M W F

Every second day for 4 weeks
- 13 sessions

empty box
- follow the path
- with a stop point in the middle

4 sections
- each section favors a different strategy
- to ensure that what is being trained is the motor skill and not a particular strategy



Experiments will need a rest/comfort break (so fatigue won't be counted)

### Research Questions
Question 1: Transfer of Learning from VR to Natural
Question 2: Validity of learning skills in remote VR
Question 3: How long does transfer last for
Question 4: VR specific factors that impact transfer of skills (Mediating/moderating factors of VR that support the transfer of skills)

### Questions and matched studies
- **Question 1:** Transfer of Learning from VR to Natural
   - Pilot Study
   - Study 1


- **Question 2:** Validity of learning skills in remote VR
    - Study 2 & 3: remote research and valid behaviours

- **Question 3:** How long does transfer last for/impact training medium has on skill saliency
    - Study 4
    - subjects from study 1 will be asked to complete a single session follow up 4 weeks after their final session
    - 50% tested on physical task
    - 50% tested on VR task

- **Question 4:** VR specific factors that impact transfer of skills (Mediating/moderating factors of VR that support the transfer of skills)
    -  Study 5
- depending on the results of 2 and 3, either remote research or in lab

Mediating/moderating factors of VR that support learning
- PPD and cue resolution although uncanny valley - so what is actually needed?
    - 8 bit visual scene
    - removal of depth cue
    - change friction coefficient (Laney & Mahoney: weak fusion)

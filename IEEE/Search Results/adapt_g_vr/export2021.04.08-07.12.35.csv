Occlusion culling is one of the key techniques for output-sensitive rendering. We generalize existing occlusion culling algorithms, intended for static scenes, to handle dynamic scenes having numerous moving objects. The data structure used by an occlusion culling method is updated to reflect the objects' possible positions. To avoid updating the structure for every dynamic object at each frame, a temporal bounding volume (TBV) is created for each occluded dynamic object, using some known constraints on the object's motion. The TBV is inserted into the structure instead of the object. Subsequently, the object is ignored as long as the TBV is occluded and guaranteed to contain the object. The generalized algorithms' rendering time is linearly affected only by the scene's visible parts, not by hidden parts or by occluded dynamic objects. Our techniques also save communications in distributed graphic systems, e.g., multiuser virtual environments, by eliminating update messages for hidden dynamic objects. We demonstrate the adaptation of two occlusion culling algorithms to dynamic scenes: hierarchical Z-buffering and BSP tree projection.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.764866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=764866","","Layout;Rendering (computer graphics);Hardware;Virtual environment;Tree graphs;Computer graphics;Robots;Data structures;Heuristic algorithms;Animation","rendering (computer graphics);computer animation;data structures;virtual reality","dynamic scene occlusion culling;complex 3D scenes;output-sensitive rendering;static scenes;dynamic scenes;moving objects;data structure;temporal bounding volume;distributed graphic systems;update messages;hidden dynamic objects;hierarchical Z-buffering;BSP tree projection;multiuser virtual environments","","12","1","48","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a low complexity and efficient compression system for multiview images using quadtree disparity estimation and multiview synthesis. Previous approaches to the problem have generally involved the transmission of a coded stereo image pair, usually using fixed block size disparity compensation, along with a pair of dense disparity maps used for intermediate view synthesis. In this work, the quadtree disparity map coded implicitly in the stereo compression process is re-used in the multiview synthesis process. The other map is also efficiently represented using a quadtree structure at low resolution. Improved multiview compression results are presented, along with intermediate views synthesised at the decoder.","","0-7803-6685-9","10.1109/ISCAS.2001.922043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922043","","Image coding;Motion estimation;Image segmentation;Decoding;Virtual reality;TV;Web and internet services;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Displays","data compression;image coding;stereo image processing;quadtrees;computational complexity;multimedia communication;virtual reality;teleconferencing","multiview image compression;quadtree disparity estimation;low complexity compression system;multiview synthesis;stereo compression process","","4","4","10","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation results indicate that the automated helicopter trainer is capable of performing the hover maneuvers. To verify the concept of the automated trainer, a simple one axis manual control cart-pole system was used. Two groups of four students each were used in the experiment with one being the experimental group which was trained with the automated trainer, and the other being the control group which was trained with no automated trainer. The experimental results show that the automated manual trainer did not ""mess up"" the training process, but no further conclusions can be drawn since the experimental group is too small to generalize the results.

TCIP's research plan is focused on securing the low-level devices, communications, and data systems that make up the power grid, to ensure trustworthy operation during normal conditions, cyber-attacks, and/or power emergencies. At the device level, new key functionality is being designed in hardware in order to detect attacks and failures and to restore proper system operation. Likewise, virtual machine technology is being developed and adapted for advanced power meters in order to permit new power use scenarios while preserving privacy. At the protocol level, new techniques are being developed to detect, react to, and recover from cyber attacks that occur while preserving integrity, availability, and real-time requirements. Further, lightweight authorization and authentication techniques are being developed that can react quickly in emergency situations. Simulation and evaluation techniques are employed to analyze real power grid scenarios and validate the effectiveness of the TCIP designs and implementations. TCIP has also developed interactive and open-ended applets for middle-school students, along with activity materials and teacher guides to facilitate the integration of research, education, and knowledge transfer by linking researchers, educators, and students. In addition to providing an overview of current TCIP research, this presentation will suggest challenges that remain, and future research that is needed to create the resilient power grid of the future.","1944-9925","978-1-4244-6551-4","10.1109/PES.2010.5589686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589686","","Power grids;Security;Protocols;Education;Power system reliability;Computational modeling","authorisation;power engineering computing;power engineering education;power grids;power meters","resilient power grid infrastructure;TCIP design;cyber infrastructure;next generation power grid;cyber attacks;power delivery;virtual machine technology;advanced power meters;lightweight authorization;emergency situations;open-ended applets;teacher guides","","9","","","","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we considered a tracking task to a visual target whose frame of reference is rotated with respect to a body-fixed frame in a time-varying manner. We investigated it by means of a wrist robot coupled with a virtual reality system: kinesthetic and visual disturbances were applied during a tracking task, in a unimodal and bimodal manner, and we observed the performance. Tracking involved two degrees of freedom and the kinesthetic disturbance was applied by the robot through the third degree of freedom. Visual disturbance was provided by rotating the visual feedback. The results suggest that the combination of a suitable proprioceptive feedback with the kinematic redundancy of the HCI system might be a rather general principle for improving the efficiency of HCI systems.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-3788-7","10.1109/ICORR.2009.5209541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209541","wrist robot;visual and proprioceptive disturbance;visuo-manual tracking;virtual reality","Target tracking;Human computer interaction;Robot kinematics;Motor drives;Mice;Wrist;Virtual reality;Feedback;Brushes;Minimally invasive surgery","robots;user interfaces;virtual reality","tracking target motion;visual disturbances;kinesthetic disturbances;human-computer interface;hand-eye coordination task;wrist robot;virtual reality system;proprioceptive feedback","","","","14","","21 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, context refers to the information that can be used to characterize these situations, and context models are employed to specify contextual information described in context-aware systems. However, even though user context is highly dynamic, existing context models either focus on modeling static views of context or lack appropriate design abstractions to deal with dynamic aspects and interactions involving contextual elements such location, time, user roles, social relationships, changing preferences and virtual environments. In this paper, we present a dynamic user-centric mobile context model that can be used to model the aspects of context-aware systems that are subject to frequent changes. We illustrate the applicability of our approach by describing a case study on mobile e-healthcare. Benefits of these models include avoiding the development of context-aware systems from scratch, enabling future use of model-driven approaches, and reducing implementation effort.","","978-1-4244-7573-5","10.1109/ICDIM.2010.5662575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662575","context-aware systems;context model;user-centric;mobile application;dynamic interactions","Context;Context modeling;Virtual environment;Adaptation model;Mobile communication;Hospitals;Mobile handsets","mobile computing;virtual reality","dynamic user centric mobile context model;context aware systems;mobile services;model driven approach","","1","1","23","","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The student spends several hours of a day in the presence of the teacher and can talk, express doubts and pose questions. These doubts, or the general feeling towards the object of learning, are not only expressed explicitly but also implicitly. Indeed, the teacher is constantly, even if in an unconscious way, reading the state of the student in search for sings of doubt, frustration, stress or fatigue. This information is then used by the teacher to adapt their methods or to personalize their approach in function of each student. These aspects, intuitively central in education, become less efficient when learning takes place in a Virtual Environment. Indeed, the growth of online courses, in which the student and the teacher often never even meet, make learning more difficult for a number of reasons. In this paper we analyse these reasons and put forward an approach for inferring the student's state that aims to minimize the effects of the absence of the teacher.","","978-1-4799-4428-6","10.1109/SIIE.2014.7017726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017726","Context-awareness;e-Learning;Stress;Fatigue","Stress;Electronic learning;Fatigue;Mice;Computers;Virtual environments;Informatics","computer aided instruction;educational courses;student experiments;virtual reality","student context;e-learning;teacher-student relationship;education;virtual environment;online courses","","1","","16","","22 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Noise is even more problematic in 3D models generated by SfM, or Structure from Motion. Here, the outlier points have an adverse effect on the processing and application of the generated point clouds that are often the basis for 3D feature detection, localization and navigation algorithms. In general, visualization of 3D environments, navigation, and volumetric medical image segmentation present numerous challenges when noisy outliers interfere with the surface delimiters of the scanned objects. In this paper, we propose an effective strategy to filter noisy points generated in the process of SfM reconstruction. We formulate a novel approach based on an adaptive moving least squares (MLS) to optimize the geometric structure of a typical 3D indoor scene model. Different from other existing adaptive MLS, our method considers the adverse interactions between the neighboring non-continuous model components. The effectiveness and the performance of our approach is demonstrated on extended indoor scene models generated from 3D point clouds based on SfM.","","978-1-7281-1419-4","10.1109/ICCICC46617.2019.9146055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146055","","Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Adaptation models;Solid modeling;Filtering;Surface reconstruction;Smoothing methods","augmented reality;computer vision;feature extraction;image reconstruction;image segmentation;least squares approximations;object detection;object recognition;solid modelling","scanned objects;noisy points;SfM reconstruction;geometric structure;adverse interactions;neighboring noncontinuous model components;extended indoor scene models;3D point clouds;multiscale point cloud optimization;reconstruction technologies;augmented reality;autonomous vehicles;remote sensing;GIS;object recognition;localization;critical fundamental problem;outlier points;generated point clouds;3D feature detection;navigation;volumetric medical image segmentation;noisy outliers;surface delimiters;adaptive MLS;adaptive moving least squares;3D indoor scene model","","","","23","","22 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high-dimensional glove signals remotely control the joint angles of a simulated planar two-link arm on a computer screen, which is used to acquire targets. A machine learning algorithm was applied to adaptively change the transformation between finger motion and the simulated robot arm. This algorithm was either LMS gradient descent or the Moore-Penrose (MP) pseudoinverse transformation. Both algorithms modified the glove-to-joint angle map so as to reduce the endpoint errors measured in past performance. The MP group performed worse than the control group (subjects not exposed to any machine learning), while the LMS group outperformed the control subjects. However, the LMS subjects failed to achieve better generalization than the control subjects, and after extensive training converged to the same level of performance as the control subjects.

In case the estimation of the joint angles and the relative pose between the hand and the object are accurate, the contact information in the virtual and in the real environment are consistent. On the other hand, when the two sources of information are not consistent, a correction of the hand posture is applied. The algorithm has been designed to work on-line.

Although the transmission of the main theoretic and practical concepts of the subject in question must remain the main focus, the improvement of students' general skills claims for special attention not only in the EHEA but also with a view to business requirements. Besides, the mobility of teachers and students among European universities has increased notably, which is a very positive experience for both communities. In this regard, new educational alternatives have to be found for this purpose, not only to provide the possibility of studying a subject abroad, but also to improve cross-curricular capabilities. It is also a reality to be taken into account that an increasing number of students are already working in the industry while following up their studies. E-learning environments are the perfect answer to these requirements, where a varied range of activities and methodologies can be used for allowing to follow the subject virtually as well as promote general cross-curricular skills such as addressing an audience, team work and preparing documentation.

Increasing the performance of multimedia stream delivery requires overcoming many technological challenges, all of them having a direct effect on the user perceived quality of experience. The quality of experience influences in turn the quality of any e-learning process. This is as users in general and learners in particular are becoming increasingly quality-aware in their expectations. Therefore delivering a good quality video stream as a part of any e-learning process is very important. This paper proposes a new adaptive multimedia delivery algorithm which can be used in the context of e-learning. The Dynamic Quality Oriented Adaptation Scheme (D-QOAS) adapts the multimedia content sent based on both user preferences and network conditions, while adjusting dynamically its adaptation policy during delivery. Simulation results show that for different user profiles and various network conditions the improvement in end-user perceived quality is significant. Important benefits are obtained in terms of the total number of simultaneous users and in the link utilization, as well as in quality as measured by some video quality metrics.","2155-5052","978-1-4244-2590-7","10.1109/ISBMSB.2009.5133739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5133739","dynamic content adaptation;e-learning;multimedia;rate control;wireless networks","Electronic learning;Streaming media;Wireless networks;Wireless LAN;Web and internet services;Laboratories;Bandwidth;Environmental factors;Telecommunication traffic;Content management","computer aided instruction;mobile radio;multimedia communication;multimedia computing;radio networks;video streaming","adaptive multimedia delivery algorithm;user quality of experience;wireless learning;mobile e-learning;multimedia content;video stream;dynamic quality oriented adaptation scheme","","6","","17","","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present study aimed to investigate the motor adaptation of manipulating an unfamiliar non-uniform weight-distribution object and the differences between both hands. Sixteen young healthy right- handed subjects (eight female and eight male) were asked to grip and lift the object using the dominant and non-dominant hand separately, and they did not know where the weight was located on the object. During lifting and holding periods, subjects should keep the object stable as far as possible to reduce rotation and tilt. The object peak roll and time interval of compensatory moment increased to 50 N·mm were calculated and quantified to analyze the motor adaptation of both hands. The statistical results had shown with the trial course, both peak roll and time interval had significantly decreased, especially between the first and second trial, indicating reinforced feed-forward and feedback control. However, there was no significant difference between the dominant and the non-dominant hands. These results had revealed the dominant hand was not superior to the non-dominant hand in the motor adaptation including accurate force or torque modulation during unfamiliar object manipulation. In a certain degree, it suggested that non-skilled motor adaptation tasks under visual feedback had no differences between both hands.

Using natural language processing techniques, we extract the annotated movements from the script, then add additional movements and adjustments from our rules engine built with theater, stage performance, and human interaction spatiotemporal relationships. In addition, we incorporate force-directed graph algorithms to adjust positions of the artificially intelligent (AI)-driven characters based on human-controlled character movements for interaction.

For the realization of a variable rotational stiffness, the active length of a torsional elastic element in serial configuration between drive and link is adjusted in VTS. After the deduction of an extended drive train model, this paper gives an advanced power analysis clarifying power-optimal settings from previous basic models and identifying additional settings that allow for a more versatile operation. Based on these results that can be generalized to other variable elastic actuator concepts, an optimized strategy for setting stiffness is determined considering the whole system dynamics including natural frequencies as well as antiresonance effects.

The primary objective of this study is to develop an improved car-following model for adaptive cruise control (ACC) by integrating conventional automated logic with human factors. Specifically, a modeling framework is proposed with a generalization of a classical action point paradigm describing drivers' psychological reactions and expectations. The action points are determined from collected data, from which the unconscious and conscious reaction regimes can be identified. Based on this identification, the human-like driving mode is carried out, and its corresponding acceleration model is developed to reproduce empirical car-following spiral within the unconscious regime, whereas the conventional autonomous mode driven by the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is used to calculate changes in acceleration for the conscious regime. To integrate the two modes, a switching rule considering the random occurrence of action points is also determined. The results of numerical experiments reveal that simulated macroscopic traffic is compatible with the three-phase theory. Moreover, traffic mobility in terms of throughput and speed is significantly improved compared to that achieved by the classical IDM. Asymptotic stability is achieved in four typical fluctuation scenarios, as the amplitudes of fluctuations converge while travelling along the vehicular platoon.

Cameras can provide rich geometric and semantic information to assist the quadrotor in performing the tasks like hovering, trajectory/moving object tracking, and etc. In this paper, we introduce a stereo camera-equipped quadrotor platform, which is suitable for demonstrating to the engineering students how the vision based nonlinear controller can be theoretically designed and practically implemented. With this quadrotor platform, we propose a vision based trajectory tracking controller as a case study, by following the Position Based Visual Servoing (PBVS) paradigm. Most of the PBVS controllers, if not all, are implemented assuming that the quadrotor's position has been accurately recovered with an independent estimator. Therefore the rigorous stability cannot be promised due to the separation principle does not hold for the general nonlinear systems. Moreover, the dynamic model used in most, if not all, of the previous PBVS controllers is derived from the Newtonian/Lagrangian mechanics and the introduced quadrotor platform has the closed-loop linear velocity control which can be fully utilized to simplify the controller design. Accordingly, a new PBVS controller is proposed in this paper for the trajectory tracking of quadrotors with embedding a novel adaptive estimator into this new controller to estimate the position of the quadrotor online, and with adopting a novel data-based dynamic model in the controller design. It is proved by Lyapunov theory that the proposed adaptive dynamic PBVS controller gives rise to the asymptotic trajectory tracking and the convergence of the estimated position to the actual one. The detailed theoretical derivation and a related experiment are conducted to show the students how to apply the nonlinear control laws to a practical quadrotor platform.","","978-1-5090-4364-4","10.1109/ROBIO.2016.7866600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7866600","","Cameras;Trajectory tracking;Kinematics;Engineering students;Vehicle dynamics;Trajectory;Asymptotic stability","closed loop systems;control engineering education;control system synthesis;helicopters;Lyapunov methods;nonlinear control systems;object tracking;stability;trajectory control;velocity control","nonlinear control laws;asymptotic trajectory tracking;adaptive dynamic PBVS controller;Lyapunov theory;data-based dynamic model;adaptive estimator;controller design;closed loop linear velocity control;Newtonian/Lagrangian mechanics;separation principle;stability;position based visual servoing;vision based trajectory tracking controller;vision based nonlinear controllers;engineering students;moving object tracking;hovering;stereo camera-equipped quadrotor platform","","","","12","","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper studies the direct impulse-based rendering paradigm to achieve this goal. Three main challenges are identified and some solutions are proposed. The first one is the energy deviation due to the sampled-data settings. Since the deviation tends to have a dissipative nature, it is called unsolicited dissipation and is suggested to be countered by applying a larger adaptive coefficient of restitution based on energy monitoring. The second challenge is the actuation limits which can be met by distributing the impulse into a sequence of force commands over successive intervals. The third is rendering resting contacts which is proposed to be done using a hybrid penalty-impulse-based technique. This paper develops a systematic way for collecting all the required mathematical formulations, analysis of the aforementioned issues and implementation of the solutions within a unified control-oriented framework entitled the generalized contact controller (GCC). Our initial simulation and experimental results show the promising aspects of the direct impulse-based rendering and the GCC framework for generating a sharper unfiltered feeling of impact at relatively low sampling rates compared to virtual coupling-based indirect methods.","","978-1-4799-6624-0","10.1109/WHC.2015.7177731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7177731","","Rendering (computer graphics);Force;Force feedback;Computational modeling;Couplings;Numerical models","force feedback;haptic interfaces;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","direct impulse-based rendering;force feedback haptics;haptic applications;high-fidelity force feedback rendering;virtual objects;energy deviation;sampled-data settings;unsolicited dissipation;energy monitoring;force commands;resting contact rendering;hybrid penalty-impulse-based technique;mathematical formulation;generalized contact controller;GCC;virtual coupling-based indirect method","","1","","17","","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The procedure combines learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning: a robot first imitates a demonstrator's execution of the task and then learns contextualized variants of the demonstrated action through experience. We use dynamic movement primitives as compact motion representations, and a model-based C-REPS algorithm for learning policies that can specify hand-over position, conditioned on context variables. Policies are learned using simulated task executions, before transferring them to the robot and evaluating emergent behaviours. We additionally conduct a user study involving participants assuming different postures and receiving an object from a robot, which executes hand-overs by either imitating a demonstrated motion, or adapting its motion to hand-over positions suggested by the learned policy. The results confirm the hypothesized improvements in the robot's perceived behaviour when it is context-aware and adaptive, and provide useful insights that can inform future developments.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197476","","Robots;Task analysis;Trajectory;Context modeling;Encoding;Adaptation models;Learning (artificial intelligence)","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);service robots;ubiquitous computing","demonstrated motion;learned policy;perceived behaviour;context-aware task execution;apprenticeship learning;assistive service robots;human-oriented tasks;task parameters;optimal behaviour;robot-to-human object hand-over;reinforcement learning;demonstrator;contextualized variants;demonstrated action;dynamic movement primitives;compact motion representations;model-based C-REPS algorithm;hand-over position;context variables;simulated task executions;evaluating emergent behaviours;context-aware action generalization","","","","35","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Performance was evaluated on three subtasks: two-dimensional compensatory tracking; fuel management; and systems monitoring. The status of automation, which was available for tracking and fuel management only, was conveyed by a change in display configuration represented by either a reduction in the size of the relevant display or by a reduction in size accompanied by its displacement to a peripheral spatial location. Combined with these interface-configuration changes were two forms of automation invocation procedure, which were pilot-initiated automation and system-initiated automation. Each was compared to a standard manual-control condition. Results indicated several response asymmetries. While tracking showed no effect for the location of the automated fuel-management display, fuel-management performance did reveal a significant effect, which favored the peripheral location of the automated tracking display. This display-location effect is thought to result from a general requirement for pilots to change their visual-scan pattern. The converse effect does not appear for fuel management and represents the continued primacy given by the pilots to tracking performance. System-initiated automation of fuel management, as a set condition, resulted in significantly better tracking performance, in both mean and variability measures, when compared to pilot-initiated automation. In the converse situation, involving the automation of the tracking subtask, a significant difference was also evident, but only in the variance measure of the fuel-management performance. The fuel-management variance for the pilot-initiated automation of tracking was significantly lower than that for the condition where the automation was enacted by the system. These results indicate that the automation-initiation process itself influences subsequent multitask performance. The present results support a general contention that the operator should initiate automation, except in circumstances in which the operator is for some reason incapacitated","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2006.886341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032921","Adaptive-task allocation;automation;displays;dynamic-interface configuration;multitasking;perceived workload","Displays;Fuels;Fluctuations;Humans;Aerospace simulation;Switches;Design automation;Monitoring;Multitasking;Research initiatives","fuel economy;human factors;man-machine systems","dynamic display relocation;simulated flight-task environment;two-dimensional compensatory tracking;fuel management;systems monitoring;peripheral spatial location;display-location effect;visual-scan pattern;adaptive-task allocation;dynamic-interface configuration","","8","","44","","19 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for estimating the layout of a given indoor image in real-time. Our method consists of a deep fully convolutional network, a novel layout-degeneration augmentation method, and a new training pipeline which integrate an adaptive edge penalty and smoothness terms into the training process. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods that depend on post-processing refinement (e.g., proposal ranking and optimization), our method motivates the generalization ability of the network and the smoothness of estimated layout edges without deploying postprocessing techniques. Moreover, the proposed approach is time-efficient since it only takes the model one forward pass to render accurate layouts.

At first a structure of RBF neural network with no hidden layer is created, then this network is trained using individual samples, according to current errors between output and input, the numbers and locations of the hidden layer nodes are dynamically added or deleted to optimize the structure of network. The strategy of increasing or decreasing nodes on-line is based on the recursive least squares algorithm. For the samples producing larger output response, the weights of neurons are retained otherwise deleted to improve RBF neural network convergence speed and real time. Nonlinear curve fitting tests including natural index, multiplication, trigonometric functions and gas content forecast are carried out by VC++ simulation software to verify the validity of this algorithm.

We show that the NLM principle can be applied while respecting the rotational nature of skeletal movement by operating in the vector space obtained by a log/exponential map. NLM has been previously overlooked in the field of motion data. The results are compellingly effective motion denoising for small and large amounts of Gaussian noise.

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads. The dyads experiment in a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) scenario to move an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment to reach predefined goal configurations.

We are interested in adaptive robots that learn from interaction traces (previous interactions with users). Our proposal is based on types of interactions where users express their level of satisfaction through feedback. Indeed, depending on the situation of interaction and the user himself, the robot behavior should adjust, and therefore can be judged, differently. From interaction traces (including robot actions and users' feedback), we aim to extract adaptation rules that give the dependencies between certain attributes of the interaction situation and/or the user profile, and the level of user satisfaction. We propose two learning algorithms to learn these adaptation rules. The first algorithm is direct, certain and optimal but slow to converge. The second is able to detect the importance of certain attributes in the adaptation process. It generalizes adaptation rules on unknown situations and to first time users, which makes it an approach with risk. We detail in this paper, our proposed model, both learning algorithms, and an evaluation of the learned rules from both algorithms by simulations and through a scenario with real users.","1944-9437","978-1-4799-6765-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926322","","Robots;Adaptation models;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Brightness;Diabetes;History","human-robot interaction;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","users feedback;adaptive behavior;personalized behavior;human-robot interactive systems;interaction traces;robot behavior;robot actions;adaptation rule extraction;learning algorithms;assistive interactive robots","","","","11","","20 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by the observation that humans continually adapt their behavior when interacting under varying social context, we propose Adaptive EXP4 (A-EXP4), a novel online learning algorithm for adapting the robot-pedestrian interaction policy. To address limitations of bandit algorithms in adaptation to unseen and highly dynamic scenarios, we employ a mixture model over the policy parameter space. Specifically, a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPMM) is used to cluster the parameters of sampled policies and maintain a mixture model over the clusters, hence effectively discovering policies that are suitable to the current environmental context in an unsupervised manner. Our simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility of A-EXP4 in accommodating interaction with different types of pedestrians while jointly minimizing social disruption through the adaptation process. While the A-EXP4 formulation is kept general for application in a variety of domains requiring continual adaptation of a robot's policy, we specifically evaluate the performance of our algorithm using a suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform. In this concrete assistive scenario, the algorithm observes how audio signals produced by the navigational system affect the behavior of pedestrians and adapts accordingly. Consequently, we find A-EXP4 to effectively adapt the interaction policy for gently clearing a navigation path in crowded settings, resulting in significant reduction in empirical regret compared to the EXP4 baseline.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967737","","","audio signal processing;control engineering computing;Gaussian processes;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;mobile robots;pedestrians","online social policy learning;Adaptive robot-pedestrian interaction;self-supervised adaptation;social interaction;active communication;audio signals;visual signals;social context;Adaptive EXP4;online learning algorithm;robot-pedestrian interaction policy;bandit algorithms;unseen scenarios;highly dynamic scenarios;policy parameter space;Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model;sampled policies;current environmental context;social disruption;adaptation process;continual adaptation;suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform;EXP4 baseline;navigation path;crowded settings","","","","45","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior arts usually focus on preserving the character of a clothes image (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g.long sleeve shirt→arm, arm→jacket), and then determines whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothes details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a clothes warping module warps clothes image according to the generated semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to stabilize the warping process during training.Third, an inpainting module for content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer fine-details.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-7168-5","10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9156594","","Semantics;Clothing;Layout;Task analysis;Shape;Visualization;Image segmentation","clothing;image segmentation;neural nets;pose estimation;realistic images;virtual reality","image content preservation;image visual try-on aims;target clothes image;photo-realistic try-on images;human poses;ACGPN;semantic layout generation module;semantic segmentation;photorealistic virtual try-on;clothes warping module;warps clothes image;visual try-on network;Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network","","4","","50","","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a collaborative learning (CL) method, which is a flexible strategy to achieve bidirectional model assistance for two models using a mutual knowledge base (MKB). The MKB is used to collect mutual information and provide assistance, and it is updated along with the learning process of the two models and separately deployed when converged. We show that CL can be applied to any two deep neural networks and is easily extended to multiple networks. Compared with the teacher-student framework, CL can achieve bidirectional assistance and does not impose specific requirements on the involved models, such as pretraining and different abilities. The experimental results demonstrate that CL can efficiently improve the learning ability and convergence speed of the two models, with superior performance to a series of relevant methods, such as ensemble learning and a series of KD-based methods. More importantly, we show that the state-of-the-art models, such as DenseNet, can be greatly improved using CL along with other popular models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2854918","Shenzhen Peacock Plan; Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Intelligent Multimedia and Virtual Reality; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409945","Bidirectional model assistance;collaborative learning;deep neural networks;mutual knowledge base","Collaborative work;Adaptation models;Neural networks;Training;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Knowledge engineering","computer aided instruction","knowledge distillation;bidirectional model assistance;teacher-student manner;learning ability;collaborative learning method;CL;mutual knowledge base;MKB;teacher-student framework;ensemble learning;KD-based methods","","2","","55","","11 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is preferable that these devices prevent the user from being in the state where the risk of falling is high rather than helping them recovering from falling motion. During turning, when the user is in the tandem stance, a state where both legs form a line along walking direction, a support base that is surrounded by two legs becomes small, and a stability margin becomes small. This paper therefore aims to prevent the tandem stance by using nonwearable robot “intelligent cane” for the elderly or physically challenged person. Generally, the behavior of the lower limb follows the upper body turning. This paper therefore introduces a cane robot control method which constrains the behavior of user's upper body. By adjusting an admittance parameter of the robot according to the positions of a support leg, the robot resists to turn while a support leg is on the same side of the turning direction. A swing leg on the turning direction side therefore freely moves to the turning direction, while a swing leg on the opposite direction side of turning hardly move to the turning direction.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2429315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7101279","Accident prevention;human–robot interaction;rehabilitation robotics;tandem stance","Legged locomotion;Turning;Admittance;Force;Senior citizens;Robot sensing systems","adaptive control;gait analysis;geriatrics;handicapped aids;human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;medical robotics","tandem stance avoidance;adaptive admittance control;asymmetric admittance control;fall prevention;walking assistance devices;walking direction;nonwearable robot intelligent cane;elderly person;physically challenged person;lower limb behavior;upper body turning;cane robot control method;turning direction;swing leg;admittance parameter","Accidental Falls;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Canes;Computer Simulation;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Exoskeleton Device;Female;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Man-Machine Systems;Models, Biological;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Physical Stimulation;Robotics;Self-Help Devices;Stress, Mechanical;Touch;Walking","18","","13","","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From the editorial of Science Robotics in 2017, there are six levels of autonomy and the existing tele-operation lies in level 0 (no autonomy). Although full autonomy would be fictional in the current moment, task/shared autonomy would be highly achievable. In endoluminal surgeries, surgeons rely on manual operation of flexible instruments for tissue manipulation and dissection. The techniques are difficult to learn, which makes them a good candidate for automation. In this letter, we introduce our work on shared autonomy of a flexible manipulator in simulated constrained endoluminal tasks, e.g., tissue dissection task in transanal total mesorectal excision and endoscopic submucosal dissection operations. During the procedure, the operator defines the dissection trajectory with a Novint Falcon device by marking via points. The dissection trajectory is dynamically planned based on the feedback from stereo endoscope system with consideration of the deformation of material. Furthermore, trajectory of the flexible manipulator is controlled by an adaptive controller with consideration of the possible collision between instruments and surrounding environment. This framework is validated by a mock up test with a three-degree-of-freedom flexible manipulator.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2924851","Hong Kong General Research Grant; Early Career Scheme; SJTU-CUHK; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745505","Medical robots and systems;sensor-based control;computer vision for automation","Surgery;Manipulators;Trajectory;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Electrostatic discharges","adaptive control;biological organs;cancer;endoscopes;feedback;flexible manipulators;haptic interfaces;medical robotics;surgery;tumours","constrained endoluminal surgical tasks;endoluminal surgeries;flexible instruments;tissue manipulation;tissue dissection task;transanal total mesorectal excision;endoscopic submucosal dissection operations;dissection trajectory;three-degree-of-freedom flexible manipulator;tele-operation;adaptive controller","","1","","23","","25 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work employs a SAN as a technique to provide the interface's action selection mechanism in an uncertain environment. The paper combines the SAN with the temporal logic to provide an e-learning system that a learning activity level evolves according to their expected contextual relevance. The system differs from the other e-learning by representing dynamic associations between learning activities and the relevance subjects. This system equipped with an event-triggered learning interface (context) adaptation component. This component provides multiple parallel processes for perception. These processes provide context screen selection and learning task operation based upon the user current situation. The SAN attempts to achieve a number of goals in an unpredictable complex dynamic environment. Spreading activation explains the predictive top-down effect of knowledge. It supports general heuristics which may be used as the first step of more elaborated methods. This model is suited to deal with the interaction between semantic and episodic memories, as well as many other practical issues regarding e-learning, including the retroactive effect of semantics over perception. The system uses the SAN to activate the most suitable interface screen (context) in response to the current conditions (learning activities) while the system continues working towards the learning objective goal. The paper presents our efforts to realize such e-learning system.

A video streaming server stores video streams with various quality levels. These streams are fragmented into several video segments. In 360-degree video streaming, these segments are tiled into video tiles. In general, the client changes the viewport quality level based on predictions of the user's viewport and network throughput. In named data networking (NDN), the throughput measured at the client is not always stable due to network-inherent caching. Therefore, the viewport video quality changes (referred to as quality switching) frequently in 360-degree video streaming over NDN. In this paper, we propose buffer-based adaptation using scalable video coding for 360-degree video streaming over NDN. In the proposed method, a buffer-based adaptation algorithm and the prefetching of video tiles are used to avoid video quality switching. A simple performance evaluation using computer simulations shows that the proposed method reduces the quality switching compared with that for a rate-based adaptation algorithm.","1976-7684","978-1-7281-4199-2","10.1109/ICOIN48656.2020.9016449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016449","360-degree video;streaming;named data networking (NDN)","Streaming media;Prefetching;Switches;Servers;Static VAr compensators;Throughput;Video recording","buffer storage;image segmentation;Internet;video coding;video streaming;virtual reality","video tiles;video quality switching;scalable video coding;video streaming;video quality;NDN;named data networking","","","","11","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effective screening of passenger bags using state-of-the-art X-ray screening systems is essential to prevent terrorist attacks. The performance of the screening process depends critically on the security personnel, because they decide whether bags are OK or whether they might contain a prohibited item. Screening X-ray images of passenger bags for dangerous and prohibited items effectively and efficiently is a demanding object recognition task. Effectiveness of computer-based training (CBT) on X-ray detection performance was assessed using computer-based tests and on the job performance measures using threat image projection (TIP). It was found that adaptive CBT is a powerful tool to increase detection performance and efficiency of screeners in X-ray image interpretation. Moreover, the results of training could be generalized to the real life situation as shown in the increased detection performance in TIP not only for trained items, but also for new (untrained) items. These results illustrate that CBT is a very useful tool to increase airport security from a human factors perspective.","2153-0742","978-1-4244-1129-0","10.1109/CCST.2007.4373478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373478","Aviation security;x-ray screening;computer-based training (CBT);threat image projection (TIP);x-ray image interpretation","On the job training;X-ray imaging;Terrorism;X-ray detection;Focusing;Personnel;Object recognition;Testing;X-ray detectors;Airports","computer based training;human factors;X-ray detection;X-ray imaging","adaptive computer-based training;X-ray screener job performance;X-ray image screening system;object recognition;X-ray detection performance;computer-based test;threat image projection;X-ray image interpretation;airport security","","23","","20","","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to facilitate the learning of multiple demonstrations and meanwhile generalize to new situations, a task-parameterized Gaussian mixture model (TP-GMM) has been recently developed. This model has achieved reliable performance in areas such as human-robot collaboration and dual-arm manipulation. However, the crucial task frames and associated parameters in this learning framework are often set by the human teacher, which renders three problems that have not been addressed yet: (i) task frames are treated equally, without considering their individual importance, (ii) task parameters are defined without taking into account additional task constraints, such as robot joint limits and motion smoothness, and (iii) a fixed number of task frames are pre-defined regardless of whether some of them may be redundant or even irrelevant for the task at hand. In this paper, we generalize the task-parameterized learning by addressing the aforementioned problems.

ALVIC-NG is an architecture that targets these environments and supports dynamic resource allocation. The scalability of an application based on ALVIC-NG and networked virtual environments in general is (among other factors) dependent on two metrics: the efficiency of the spatial subdivision scheme and the ability for the load balancing strategies to maintain a clustered assignment of regions to server instances.

Initially, a review of related work about the implemented AEHS/ITS and the didactic design principles of the MATHEMA are presented. Through the interactive problem solving, the system supports the students in solving electromagnetism problems, individually and/or collaboratively, by following an activity that is based on the experimentation with simulations, explorations, guided discovery, and collaboration didactic approaches. An experimental study with senior high school students showed that they improve their performances when following this activity.

The cognitive states of drivers significantly affect driving safety; in particular, fatigue driving, or drowsy driving, endangers both the individual and the public. For this reason, the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that can identify drowsy driving states is a crucial and urgent topic of study. Many EEG-based BCIs have been developed as artificial auxiliary systems for use in various practical applications because of the benefits of measuring EEG signals. In the literature, the efficacy of EEG-based BCIs in recognition tasks has been limited by low resolutions. The system proposed in this paper represents the first attempt to use the recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) architecture to increase adaptability in realistic EEG applications to overcome this bottleneck. This paper further analyzes brain dynamics in a simulated car driving task in a virtual-reality environment. The proposed RSEFNN model is evaluated using the generalized cross-subject approach, and the results indicate that the RSEFNN is superior to competing models regardless of the use of recurrent or nonrecurrent structures.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2496330","Aiming for the Top University Plan within National Chiao Tung University through the Ministry of Education, Taiwan; University System of Taiwan–UC San Diego International Center of Excellence in Advanced Bio-Engineering within the Ministry of Science and Technology through the I-RiCE Program; Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance Annual Program Plan through the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement; Tung Thih Electronic Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7331291","Brain-computer interface (BCI);driving fatigue;electroencephalography (EEG);recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN).;Brain–computer interface (BCI);driving fatigue;electroencephalography (EEG);recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN)","Electroencephalography;Fatigue;Brain modeling;Vehicles;Fuzzy neural networks;Biological neural networks;Real-time systems","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;fuzzy neural nets;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;virtual reality","brain dynamics;driving fatigue prediction;recurrent self-evolving fuzzy neural network;RSEFNN;online gradient descent learning rule;electroencephalography regression problem;EEG regression problem;driving fatigue;driving safety;brain-computer interfaces;BCI;drowsy driving states identification;car driving task;virtual-reality environment","Adult;Automobile Driving;Brain;Electroencephalography;Fatigue;Female;Forecasting;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Male;Neural Networks (Computer);Reaction Time;Young Adult","61","","39","","18 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study main objective is to evaluate the medical staff proficiency and implementation of IT based technologies and instrumentation in medical research, education and clinical practice at Saudi General Tertiary Hospitals. The study was carried out at King Saud Medical City (KSMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The research main data was collected predominantly using a cross-sectional survey questionnaire. The research results showed that an average overall rate of 61.68% of the participants' usage (sometimes, often, or always) of IT based technologies in clinical tasks. When comparing various clinical tasks, the highest average rate for IT usage was for continuing medical education task (65.9%). The lowest average rate for IT clinical task usage was for teaching interim resident (34.1%). With respect to adoption of IT for enhancing medical knowledge & education, the most used E-resource, was research databases and On line journals (40.4% reported using it), and the leased used was Virtual Reality and Simulations (17%). A relatively high percentage of participants (50.28% reported that all the survey questioned medical E-resources are unavailable to them in their work settings). For most adapted E-clinical systems, KSMC participants selected the CPOE system (53.2 % claimed using it often and always), while the least E-clinical system used was the LIMS system (19.1 %). Main results from this research showed that IT based technologies diffusion at King Saud medical city is very comparable to similar institutions in advanced countries.

The motivation for this paper is to develop a general framework to render a visually plausible hand given only the fingertip positions. In addition, our framework adjusts the size of a virtual hand based on the fingertip positions and device's structure, and reduces a mismatch between the pose of the rendered and user's hand by retargeting virtual finger motions. Moreover, we impose a new hinge constraint on the finger model to employ a real-time inverse kinematic solver.

In the context of materials development, an area which is pervasive and impacts nearly all aspects of our lives, these opportunities are potentially very profound. Materials design, as a profession and a field of research, has had an enduring legacy of contributions. Innovation is often associated with a 'leap' in performance or breakthrough from one: equilibrium point to another new point with new values. Innovations require 'something' new as well as incremental efforts based upon a feasible and rational plan. It is a dynamic process, driven by a 'sixth' sense and a human desire to discover. This human aspiration to innovate will be driven by and will leverage an 'exploding' information technology age which will foster evermore creative environments for design. Users of these environments will use tools which evolve and adapt to the user community. The speed and ease of use of such environments will accelerate the fusion and synergy of varying opinions and ideas, while minimizing expensive trial and error. New insights, however unorthodox, may be explored more rapidly, and at minimal expense, via virtual design environments which enable the simulation and modeling of artifacts regardless of their complexity. In this context, we have organized this session to stimulate your awareness of future directions for materials design, and more generally, we want you to reconsider the 'richness' of the computing resources, data, knowledge, methods, and communication technology available.","","0-7803-5489-3","10.1109/IPMM.1999.791563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=791563","","Technological innovation;Internet;Computational modeling","information technology;CAD;virtual reality","materials design;personal computing;Internet;materials development;information technology age;creative environments;user community;virtual design environments;communication technology","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hands-on class activities effectively convey an understanding of a complex model without equations. Computer simulations promote visual comprehensions for highly dynamic systems. In our course, general ecology for biologists, mathematical complexity is a crucial element required for transitioning from the real world to the world of numbers pertaining both linear and non-linear relationships. We designed indoor activities to initiate analytical thinking and to extend appreciations of outdoor experiences to abstract reasoning in numerical terms and computer models. Our approach fulfills the objectives of guiding biology students to construct scenarios reflecting complex interactions among organisms in the natural world. They overcame their primarily negative mindset, feeling intimidated by mathematics and uncomfortably unfamiliar with computer technology. To evaluate our teaching method, students were asked to qualitatively write an after action evaluation. They expressed enjoyment in their learning. Though struggling at times, the experience was very rewarding and worthwhile. Students came to a realization of the importance of mathematics and information literacy skills, while drawing appreciation and awareness from outdoor experiences.

In general, stereo sequences can be captured using a pair of cameras but the resulting sequences tend to yield various well-known problems due to different characteristics of the pair of stereo cameras. Meanwhile, a camera with the stereoscopic adapter provides a natural way to capture and display stereoscopic video. It allows users to access all the functions built into the camera, e.g. zoom, auto-focus, auto-exposure, special effects, etc. The cost however is the reduced quality of the videos since the adapter allows capture of stereo video sequences in the field sequential format, i.e. left and right images in different scan lines, respectively. In addition, it generates size and color distortions due to the physical configuration of the mirror in the adapter. We analyze and compensate for such distortions to reduce possible errors in vision applications exploiting the stereo images.

The control architecture of ADAPT is composed of three main components: a high-level task scheduler, a functional task model, and a low-level admittance controller. The high-level task scheduler adaptively selects the task to practice and sets the task difficulty based on the previous performance of the patients. The functional task model generates desired trajectories based on learned models of task dynamics. Tasks dynamics are modeled with receptive field weighted regression (RFWR), such that the feel of the task tools is accurately modeled, and the task difficulty can be easily adjusted. The low-level admittance controller, which is also learned with RFWR, implements the selected task trajectory for robot-patient interaction. The results of a preliminary experiment with a healthy subject demonstrate the successful operation of ADAPT.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2009.2019787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967899","Admittance controller;locally weighted learning;motor schedule;neurorehabilitation;rehabilitation robotics;stroke;upper extremity","Rehabilitation robotics;Robotics and automation;Extremities;Medical treatment;Switches;Automatic control;Admittance;Computer science;Medical robotics;Adaptive systems","diseases;electric variables control;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;regression analysis","adaptive automated robotic task-practice system;arm functions;adaptive and automatic presentation of tasks;upper extremity function;ADAPT;stroke rehabilitation;tool-changing system;low-level admittance controller;functional task model;high-level task scheduler;task dynamics;receptive field weighted regression;robot-patient interaction","","23","","54","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Scenarios with information in a 360° area around the user may especially profit from attention guiding techniques adapting to different navigation modes. To analyse potential performance improvements, two common guiding techniques for fine navigation were combined with an arrow for coarse navigation. Within a laboratory study, the effects of the combination of an arrow with the attention funnel and SWAVE techniques on search time and rotation overhead, as well as subjective preference, have been examined. Results show that the combination partially improves the performance of attention guiding techniques when considering objective and subjective parameters. As the findings are not generally applicable, more in-depth research on the combination of different designs for coarse navigation, as well as other factors of interest, like distraction caused by the attention guiding techniques, should be carried out.","2474-0489","978-1-7281-4540-2","10.1109/VS-Games.2019.8864539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864539","attention guiding;augmented reality;navigation","Navigation;Task analysis;Visualization;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;User experience;Augmented reality","augmented reality;helmet mounted displays;user interfaces","visual attention guiding;coarse navigation;fine navigation;attention guiding techniques;attention funnel;head-mounted-displays;SWAVE techniques;stereoscopic cues;two-dimensional interfaces","","","","12","","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main problems in DIBR is how to reduce holes that occur on the generated virtual view images. In general, preprocessing the whole depth image by smoothing filter before image warping can reduce the hole occurrence. However, smoothing the whole depth image not only produces some geometric distortions on the generated virtual directional images, but also increases computation time. This paper proposes an adaptive edge-oriented smoothing process to solve the above problem, in which the adaptive smoothing filter for the depth map is determined by the characteristics of the hole region with or without vertical lines in the color image. The adaptive smoothing filter contains two types: the asymmetric smoothing filter is used to reduce the geometric distortions by smoothing the hole regions with vertical lines that belong to the background; and the horizontal smoothing filter is used to reduce hole occurrence and computation time by smoothing the hole regions without vertical lines. The experiment results show that the proposed method turns out to be a good tradeoff between time saving, hole reduction rate, and virtual view quality.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2010.2100372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672603","Asymmetric smoothing filter;depth image-based rendering;edge-oriented smoothing process","Smoothing methods;Three dimensional displays;Cameras;Color;Pixel;Image edge detection;Rendering (computer graphics)","rendering (computer graphics);smoothing methods;stereo image processing;virtual reality","nongeometric distortion smoothing approach;depth map preprocessing;depth image-based rendering;image warping;geometric distortions;virtual directional images;edge-oriented smoothing process;asymmetric smoothing filter;2D color image;virtual view 3D images","","65","1","32","","20 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although there has been several previous works involving other organs, this is the first to tackle the uterus. Furthermore, whereas previous works perform registration between one or two laparoscopic images (which come from a stereo laparoscope) we show how to solve the problem using many images (e.g. 20 or more), and show that this can dramatically improve registration. Also unlike previous works, we show how to integrate occluding contours as registration cues. These cues provide powerful registration constraints and should be used wherever possible. We present retrospective qualitative results on a patient with two myomas and quantitative semi-synthetic results.

The reason is that the quality of the delivered service will depend both on what resources are allocated to the user, and how these resources are managed at runtime. This problem is challenging because the definition of Quality of Service (QoS) is in general user specific, so hardwired resource management mechanisms will not be sufficient. To address the runtime resource management problem, we introduce the concept of a delegate, a code segment that applications or service providers inject into the network to assist in the management of the network resources that are allocated to them. This approach allows users to tailor runtime resource management to best meet their specific needs. Moreover, since delegates execute inside the network, they can easily collect information on changing network conditions, and can quickly adapt the resource allocations for the flows they are responsible for. Delegates have been implemented in the CMU Darwin system, which provides an integrated set of customizable resource management mechanisms in support of sophisticated network services. In this paper we present the design of the delegate runtime system, focusing on the programming interface that delegates use to monitor the network and modify resource use. We describe how delegates are supported in Darwin, and we show how delegates can be used to deal with a number of problems such as congestion control for video streaming, tracking down non-adaptive sources, and balancing traffic load.","","0-7803-5261-0","10.1109/OPNARC.1999.758432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=758432","","Resource management;Runtime;Quality of service;Virtual reality;Games;Videoconference;Quality management;Monitoring;Streaming media;Telecommunication traffic","application program interfaces;resource allocation;virtual reality;quality of service","programming interface;network resource management;advanced network services;virtual reality games;distributed simulation;video conferencing;hardwired resource management mechanisms;runtime resource management problem;code segment;CMU Darwin system;customizable resource management mechanisms;congestion control;video streaming;traffic load","","11","3","36","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reasons for this are the reduced risk for the patients and the easy repeatability of complicated surgical procedures. Therefore, an improved impression of reality during the simulated training must be obtained. For this, a complex model of the human's anatomy and physiology is needed. With regards to pathological conditions, which should be considered, it is necessary to build more general anatomical models. Simple static models are unsuitable for surgical simulation because convincing interactivity is only possible with deformable organs and elastic tissues. Traditional models of tissue deformation have difficulties to simulate the appearance of deformation because of the unknown physical parameters of the tissue's elasticity. Hence the paper describes a method for elastodynamic shape modeling with neuro fuzzy systems, which are able to adapt the necessary parameters from real tissues.","","0-7695-0065-X","10.1109/SMA.1999.749337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=749337","","Elastodynamics;Shape;Deformable models;Surgery;Medical simulation;Human anatomy;Physiology;Pathology;Elasticity;Fuzzy systems","biomedical education;medical computing;virtual reality;digital simulation;computer based training;fuzzy neural nets;computer graphics","elastodynamic shape modeling;virtual medicine;surgical simulation;training method;medical education;complicated surgical procedures;human anatomy;physiology;pathological conditions;anatomical models;interactivity;deformable organs;elastic tissues;tissue deformation;neuro fuzzy systems;real tissues","","8","","26","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some platforms allow synchronous communication between the tutor and the student, i.e., the tutoring process takes place at a predetermined time, simulating conventional training. Asynchronous educational platforms enable the student to study and solve exercises in the time and at the pace of their own choice. However, there are questions about users' data, especially considering the General Data Protection Regulation 1 (GDPR) in force since 25 May 2018. In this article, we describe the features that distinguish synchronous from asynchronous learning systems and identify their points of impact with specific GDPR elements, respectively. Particularly for the asynchronous method, we focus on platforms that process user data and appropriately adapt the educational material.

The utilization of gestural interaction metaphors within a 3D environment can turn the user experience more familiar and concrete, making the training curb smaller. However, in order to apply interaction metaphors it is necessary their classification and generalization, so that they can be widely deployed in different applications. This paper introduces the development of a generic and customizable solution for the mediation of user gestural interaction (selection, manipulation and navigation) with heterogeneous rendering engines for virtual reality environments. This solution, called Gesture3DFramework, allows the users context and gesture-metaphors configuration to be easily customized so that it can be adaptable to multiple 3D virtual environments. With Gesture3DFramework, the final user (and developer) will be provided with a higher level of abstraction when it comes to the development of interactive virtual reality applications, since once the configuration directives have been described, the system will adapt itself to the specific interaction routines of the applied rendering engine.","","978-1-7281-0437-9","10.1109/CLEI.2018.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8786315","Virtual Reality;Gesture Interaction;Selection;Manipulation;Navigation;Immersion;3D environment","Three-dimensional displays;Casting;Navigation;Middleware;Virtual environments;Rendering (computer graphics)","gesture recognition;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;middleware;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","generic gesture-based interaction middleware;user experience;user gestural interaction;multiple 3D virtual environments;interactive virtual reality applications;Gesture3DFramework;rendering engine;interaction routines","","","","","","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly evident in the developments apparent in the ongoing 'Deconstructing Duchamp' project, where 'flocking' behaviours have been applied to Duchampian digitised items to observe the familial relations within, and key to his work, at play. Following this project, a second work 'Shift-Life' has proceeded to further develop the idea of allotting animal-like behaviours to electronic data items giving them the appearance of possessing a basic intelligence. By then observing their response to our physical interactions we can glean a clearer understanding, from their inter-relationships, of a complex conceptual framework. While Marcel Duchamp offered the art world one of the most complex and formative pieces of art ever, initiating the shift of values from aesthetics to idea, Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution, the 'big' idea of survivability through adaptation. Shift-Life was created as part of the national Darwin 200 project for the international bicentenary in 2009. It is a complex system of virtual life-forms struggling to survive in an environment made volatile through human interaction. Central to this installation work is the artificial life ecosystem as a self-sustaining, self-reproducing equilibrium of creatures and plants living in it. The general behaviour of each organism was more sophisticated than for the Duchampian creatures in that they were equipped for survival strategies and the reproduction of progenies. An exposition of the Shift-Life program is therefore presented followed by reflection on both projects and future directions for this collaborative research where potential emergent behaviours are concerned.","","978-1-4673-2736-7","10.1109/CW.2012.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337436","Duchamp;Darwin;associative media;behaviours;mixed-reality;artificial life;agent-based modelling","Art;Glass;Ecosystems;Organisms;Toxicology;Vegetation","art;multimedia computing;reliability;virtual reality","Darwinian virtual objects;multimedia;conceptual art practice;Deconstructing Duchamp project;Duchampian digitised items;familial relations;second work Shift-Life;animal-like behaviours;electronic data items;physical interactions;complex conceptual framework;formative pieces;complex pieces;survivability through adaptation;international bicentenary;complex system;virtual life-forms;human interaction;self-sustaining;artificial life ecosystem;Duchampian creatures;collaborative research;emergent behaviours","","","","9","","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system in its current configuration is designed to enable distance training of students in real scenarios of robot manipulator programming. From a technological perspective, the research work presented in this paper is directed towards the adaptation of concepts and techniques developed in the field of telerobotics and virtual reality, and their integration in such e-laboratory settings. This paper focuses particularly on the educational impact of such systems. The goal is to assess the performance of e-laboratory scenarios in terms of the efficacy of training provided to students. The results of a pilot experimental study are presented, providing a comparative evaluation for three training modalities: real, remote, and virtual training on robot manipulator programming. The experiments were conducted according to an evaluation protocol specially designed for the considered target training task, using scoring charts to obtain quantitative performance measures and assess the performance of the student groups participating in the course. Training, as a dynamic process, is approached according to a classical three dimensional model, and performance scores are accordingly assessed in these dimensions (namely: low-level versus mid and high-level skills and understanding). The obtained results reveal certain differences between the three groups, particularly as related to the low-level skill training score, giving some insight about the training `dimensions' that are expected to be mostly affected by the absence of physical (or realistic virtual) presence in a real hands-on experimentation. Statistical analysis indicates, however, that, despite these apparent differences, such e-laboratory modules can be integrated quite effectively in practical scenarios, creating virtual training environments that can provide adequate learning elements, as related particularly to mid and high-level skill acquisition. Further work and large-scale studies are still needed, though, in order to explore the extent to which such a general conclusion is valid in different training settings, and to form the basis of a more theoretical evaluation for a comprehensive understanding of the pedagogical differences between real, virtual, and remote learning/training methodologies and experiences","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2006.879255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668280","Distance training;evaluation methodology;remote laboratory;telerobotics;virtual robotic laboratory","Manipulators;Telerobotics;Virtual reality;Control engineering education;Statistics;Student experiments","computer based training;control engineering education;distance learning;educational courses;manipulators;statistical analysis;student experiments;telerobotics;virtual reality","virtual robotic laboratory;remote robotic laboratory;e-laboratory;distance training;robot manipulator programming;telerobotics;virtual reality;scoring charts;statistical analysis;virtual training environments;high-level skill acquisition","","103","","24","","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While recent advances in end-to- end Machine Learning, especially Imitation Learning and Reinforcement appear promising, they are constrained by the need of large amounts of difficult-to-collect labeled real- world data. Simulated data, on the other hand, is easy to generate, but generally does not render safe behaviors in diverse real-life scenarios. In this work we propose a novel method for learning robust visuomotor policies for real-world deployment which can be trained purely with simulated data. We develop rich state representations that combine supervised and unsupervised environment data. Our approach takes a cross-modal perspective, where separate modalities correspond to the raw camera data and the system states relevant to the task, such as the relative pose of gates to the drone in the case of drone racing. We feed both data modalities into a novel factored architecture, which learns a joint lowdimensional embedding via Variational Auto Encoders. This compact representation is then fed into a control policy, which we trained using imitation learning with expert trajectories in a simulator. We analyze the rich latent spaces learned with our proposed representations, and show that the use of our cross-modal architecture significantly improves control policy performance as compared to end-to-end learning or purely unsupervised feature extractors. We also present real-world results for drone navigation through gates in different track configurations and environmental conditions. Our proposed method, which runs fully onboard, can successfully generalize the learned representations and policies across simulation and reality, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341049","","Navigation;Machine learning;Logic gates;Feature extraction;Trajectory;Task analysis;Drones","autonomous aerial vehicles;cameras;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence)","cross-modal representations;robustly solving open-world perception-control tasks;first-person view aerial navigation;end-to- end Machine Learning;imitation learning;real- world data;safe behaviors;real-life scenarios;robust visuomotor policies;real-world deployment;rich state representations;unsupervised environment data;cross-modal perspective;separate modalities correspond;raw camera data;system states;drone racing;data modalities;joint lowdimensional embedding;compact representation;rich latent spaces;cross-modal architecture;control policy performance;end-to-end learning;purely unsupervised feature extractors;real-world results;drone navigation;learned representations","","1","","39","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our model, a variant of SE3-Nets, learns a low-dimensional pose embedding for visuomotor control via an encoder-decoder structure. Unlike prior work, our model is structured: given an input scene, our network explicitly learns to segment salient parts and predict their pose embedding and motion, modeled as a change in the pose due to the applied actions. We train our model using a pair of point clouds separated by an action and show that given supervision only through point-wise data associations between the frames our network is able to learn a meaningful segmentation of the scene along with consistent poses. We further show that our model can be used for closed-loop control directly in the learned low-dimensional pose space, where the actions are computed by minimizing pose error using gradient-based methods, similar to traditional model-based control. We present results on controlling a Baxter robot from raw depth data in simulation and RGBD data in the real world and compare against two baseline deep networks. We also test the robustness and generalization performance of our controller under changes in camera pose, lighting, occlusion, and motion. Our method is robust, runs in real-time, achieves good prediction of scene dynamics, and outperforms baselines on multiple control runs.

The paddler is supposed to be a model of an animal that might exist, although it is perfectly possible to view it as a model of a robot that might be built. The agent is assumed to navigate in a simulated deep-sea environment, where it forages for autoluminescent prey. It uses a biologically inspired phototaxic foraging strategy, while paddling in a layer just above the bottom. The advantage of this living space is that the navigation problem—and hence our model—is essentially two-dimensional. Moreover, the deep-sea environment is physically simple (and hence easy to simulate): no significant currents, constant temperature, completely dark. A foraging performance metric is developed that circumvents the necessity to solve the traveling salesman problem. A parametric simulation study then quantifies the influence of habitat factors, such as the density of prey, and body geometry (e.g., placement, direction and directional selectivity of the eyes) on foraging success. Adequate performance proves to require a specific body geometry adapted to the habitat characteristics. In general, performance degrades gracefully for modest changes of the geometric and habitat parameters, indicating that we work in a stable region of “design space.” The parameters have to strike a compromise between, on the one hand, the ability to “fixate” an attractive target, and on the other hand, to “see” as many targets at the same time as possible. One important conclusion is that simple reflex-based navigation can be surprisingly efficient. Additionally, performance in a global task (foraging) depends strongly on local parameters such as visual direction tuning, position of the eyes and paddles, and so forth. Behavior and habitat “mold” the body, and the body geometry strongly influences performance. The resulting platform enables further testing of foraging strategies or vision and locomotion theories stemming either from biology or from robotics.","1064-5462","","10.1162/106454698568503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787864","hypothetical animal;two-light experiment;phototaxic foraging;visuomotor behavior;foraging performance;animats","","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

We investigated it by means of a wrist robot coupled with a virtual reality system. The experimental protocol consisted of applying kinesthetic and visual disturbances in a unimodal or bimodal manner and observing the tracking performance. The kinesthetic disturbance was provided by passively rotating the forearm of the subjects by the third degree of freedom of the wrist robot, while the visual disturbance was provided by rotating the visual scene.

Action-level imitation involves two modules. The viewpoint transformation (VPT) performs a ""rotation"" to align the demonstrator's body to that of the learner. The visuo-motor map (VMM) maps this visual information to motor data. For program-level (gesture) imitation, there is an additional module that allows the system to recognize and generate its own interpretation of observed gestures to produce similar gestures/goals at a later stage. Besides the holistic approach to the problem, our approach differs from traditional work in i) the use of motor information for gesture recognition; ii) usage of context (e.g., object affordances) to focus the attention of the recognition system and reduce ambiguities, and iii) use iconic image representations for the hand, as opposed to fitting kinematic models to the video sequence. This approach is motivated by the finding of visuomotor neurons in the F5 area of the macaque brain that suggest that gesture recognition/imitation is performed in motor terms (mirror) and rely on the use of object affordances (canonical) to handle ambiguous actions. Our results show that this approach can outperform more conventional (e.g., pure visual) methods.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.846654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1430829","Anthropomorphic robots;imitation;learning;visuomotor coordination","Robot kinematics;Cognitive robotics;Humans;Robot sensing systems;Image recognition;Mirrors;Focusing;Image representation;Video sequences;Neurons","gesture recognition;image representation;psychology;robot vision;image sequences;robot kinematics;learning (artificial intelligence);humanoid robots","visual learning;motor representation;program level visual imitation;action-level imitation;viewpoint transformation;VPT;visuo-motor map;VMM map;motor data;motor information;gesture recognition system;iconic image representation;kinematic model;video sequence;visuomotor neuron;F5 area;macaque brain;anthropomorphic robot;visuomotor coordination","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Bionics;Computer Simulation;Hand;Hand Strength;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Motor Skills;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Robotics;Vision","72","1","32","","16 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Other work has shown that these two types of adaptation may share similar neural resources. One effective test of this sharing hypothesis would be to show that one could teach one using the other. This study investigated whether training with a specialized force field could benefit the learning of a visual distortion. Two groups of subjects volunteered to participate in this study. One group of subjects trained directly on a visual rotation. The other group of subjects trained in a ""mixed field"" condition. The mixed field was primarily a force field that was specially designed so that, after adapting to its characteristics, the subject would make the appropriate movement in the visual rotation condition. The mixed field condition also contained intermittent test movements that evaluated performance in the visual rotation condition. Results showed that errors reduced more rapidly in the mixed field condition. We also found that subjects were able to generalize what they learned to movement directions that were not part of the training, but there was no detectable difference between the two groups. Finally, we found no difference in the rate these training effects washed out after subjects returned to normal conditions. This study shows that training with robotic forces can facilitate the learning of visual rotations. The learning may be enhanced in the mixed condition by the addition of cutaneous and proprioceptive force sensors. Moreover, this study can be applied to telerobotics and the rehabilitation of brain injured individuals, where there is often a distortion in hand-eye coordination.","","0-7695-2112-6","10.1109/HAPTIC.2004.1287196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287196","","Force sensors;Nonlinear distortion;Robot kinematics;Kinetic theory;Testing;Robot sensing systems;Rehabilitation robotics;Glass;Telerobotics;Brain injuries","learning (artificial intelligence);image processing;force sensors;distortion;telerobotics;neural nets","force field training;visual distortions;sensory crossover;visuomotor;prism glasses;neural resources;visual rotation;telerobotics;hand-eye coordination;robotic forces;force sensors","","2","","","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is closely linked to automated aspects of sensorimotor control and understood to depend on one's ability to monitor the details of one's movements. As such SoA has been argued to be a critical component of self-awareness in general and contribute to presence in virtual reality environments in particular. A common approach to investigating SoA is to ask participants to perform goal-directed movements and introducing spatial or temporal visuomotor mismatches in the feedback. Feedback movements are traditionally either switched with someone else's movements using a 2D video-feed or modified by providing abstracted feedback about one's actions on a computer screen. The aim of the current study was to quantify conscious monitoring and the SoA for ecologically valid, three dimensional feedback of the participants' actual limb and movements. This was achieved by displaying an Infra-Red (IR) feed of the participants' upper limbs in an augmented virtuality environment (AVE) using a head-mounted display (HMD). Movements could be fed back in real-time (46ms system delay) or with an experimental delay of up to 570ms. As hypothesized, participant's SoA decreased with increasing temporal visuomotor mismatches (p<;.001), replicating previous findings and extending them to AVEs. In-line with this literature, we report temporal limits of 222±60ms (50% psychometric threshold) in N=28 participants. Our results demonstrate the validity of the experimental platform by replicating studies in SoA both qualitatively and quantitatively.

The system is able to control simple reaching tasks by only fusing visual and proprioceptive sensory data, without computational kinematic modeling of the arm structure, Thanks to the generalization features typical of the neural approach, the same neurocontroller has been easily adapted and successfully validated for controlling different manipulators with different mechanical structures, i.e. number of degrees of freedom, link length and weight, etc. The proposed scheme is directly inspired to research results in the field of neuroscience, specifically on nervous structures and physiological mechanisms involved in sensory motor coordination. From a psychological point of view J. Piaget (1976) explained visuo-motor associations in his scheme of circular reaction. He observed how, by making endogenous movements and correlating the resulting arm and hand spatial locations, the brain allows an auto-association to be created between visual and proprioceptive sensing. The work presented in this paper is derived from the more recent DIRECT model proposed D. Bullock et al. (1993). Significant and original modifications of such model have been introduced by the authors to increase, at the same time, both system performance and the biological coherence. The proposed neurocontroller has been first simulated both in the 2-dimensional and the 3-dimensional case, and then implemented for experimental trials on two real robotic manipulators.","","0-7803-7579-3","10.1109/CNE.2003.1196858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196858","","Manipulators;Biological system modeling;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Neurocontrollers;Robot control;Artificial neural networks;Biology computing;Computational modeling;Neuroscience","manipulators;robot vision;neurocontrollers;sensor fusion;neural nets","neurocontroller;robotic manipulators;biologically-inspired visuomotor coordination neural models;sensor-based control;artificial neural networks;proprioceptive sensory data;sensory motor coordination;endogenous movements;biological coherence","","4","","11","","13 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The BOLD fMRI signal was acquired during a novel 2-D tracking task in which participants (10 males, 10 females) were cued to either briefly stop tracking and close their eyes (Stop+Close) or to briefly stop tracking (Stop) only. The onset and duration of eye-closure and stopping were identified post hoc from eye-video, EOG, and visuomotor response. fMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) and tensorial independent component analysis (TICA). The GLM-based analysis identified predominantly increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity during eye-closure and stopping in multisensory areas, sensory-motor integration areas, and default-mode regions. Stopping during tracking elicited increased activity in visual processing areas, sensory-motor integration areas, and premotor areas. TICA separated the spatio-temporal pattern of activity into multiple task-related networks including the 1) occipito-medial frontal eye-movement network, 2) sensory areas, 3) left-lateralized visuomotor network, and 4) fronto-parietal visuomotor network, which were modulated differently by Stop+Close and Stop. The results demonstrate the merits of using simultaneous fMRI, behavioral, and physiological recordings to investigate the mechanisms underlying complex human behaviors in the human brain. Furthermore, knowledge of widespread modulations in brain activity due to voluntary eye-closure or stopping during a continuous visuomotor task is important for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying involuntary behaviors, such as microsleeps and attention lapses, which are often accompanied by brief eye-closure and/or response failures.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2050782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477176","Attention;eye-closure;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);simultaneous recording;tensorial independent component analysis;visuomotor tracking","Physics;Biomedical engineering;Independent component analysis;Hospitals;Electrooculography;Humans;Brain;Permission;Data analysis;Delay","biomedical MRI;blood;independent component analysis;neurophysiology;vision","BOLD change;cued eye closure;continuous visuomotor task;neural activity;functional magnetic resonance imaging;eye video;EOG;MRI scanner;2D tracking task;general linear model;tensorial independent component analysis;blood oxygenation level dependent;multisensory area;sensory motor integration area","Adult;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Cues;Electrooculography;Eye Movements;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Motion Perception;Movement;Oxygen Consumption;Young Adult","7","","34","","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To better understand this unexpected adaptive capacity in brain-lesioned patients, we investigated the contribution of awareness for the optical shift to the development of prism adaptation. The lack of awareness found in neglect was simulated in a multiple-step group where healthy subjects remained unaware of the optical deviation because of its progressive stepwise increase from 2° to 10°. We contrasted this method with the classical single-step group in which subjects were aware of the visual shift because they were directly exposed to the full 10° shift. Because the number of pointing trials was identical in the two groups, the total amount of deviation exposure was 50% larger in the single-step group. Negative after-effects were examined with an open-loop pointing task performed with the adapted hand, and generalization was tested with open-loop pointing with the nonexposed hand to visual and auditory targets. The robustness of adaptation was assessed by an open-loop pointing task after a simple de-adaptation procedure. The progressive, unaware condition was associated with larger negative after-effects, transfer to the non-exposed hand for the visual and auditory pointing tasks, and greater robustness. The amount of adaptation obtained remained, nevertheless, lower than the exaggerated adaptive capacity seen in patients with neglect. Implications for the functional mechanisms and the anatomical substrates of prism adaptation are discussed.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.2007.19.2.341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6794480","","","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

#### VR is a cool technology

Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology defined by the ability to build and experience worlds. Stereoscopic screens placed a few centimeters away from the eyes have presented scenes of rooftops that incite vertigo (richie's plank, )

While popular science fiction (such as The Matrix) explored ... and learning Kung Fu via download, the actual VR technology has been used to teach tai chi, surgery, flight sim, military sim (..., Bossard, Kermarrec, Buche, & Tisseau, 2008 ; Holden, 2005), For training nurses, training pilots, practice and assessment of laparoscopic surgery, the education of chemistry and electrical engineering concepts and geography, as well as various sports.  

VR technology has profoundly evolved since Ivan Sutherland’s Sword of Damocles (Sutherland, 1965) and the term VR has become synonymous with the head mounted display (HMD) technologies that allow individuals to receive and interact with computer generated stimuli. For this report, the separation between HMD based VR (HMD-VR) and other VR technologies will be made.

Despite the ubiquity of VR for professional training, and  assumption that it transfers that ar and vr simulations foster motor learning the literature is unclear on if skills taught/learnt in VR are transferable to the real world (Sigrist et al., 2013b; ).

Without clairty and knowledge of if, how, and under what conditions newly acquired skills will transfer, VR may not be an appropriate medium for training. This is of particular concern when VR is being used as a subtitute training environment for highly dangerous situations.

## Skill Learning Background
>  literature review for ToL

#### What is learning
Learning is typically defined as a relatively permanent change in a person’s capability to perform a skill (Schmidt & Lee, 2005).  

#### What is a skill?
I am defining skill by 1) something not known prior/something new, 2) able to be measured, 3) able to be improved through training (Adams, 1987)

Some work has indicated that there is an equivalence in terms of complex skill learning between the real and simulated environments (Alicea, 2020)  however previous reviews have struggled to produce conclusive results due to wide variation in technologies that claim the name "VR" and
> the lack of coherence in how to study such a technology (Molier et al., 2010).

Transfer of learning from VR to natural has been assessed in knowledge transfer, conflict resolution, mathematics training
- dominated by skill training

Baseball (Gray, 2017), crane operation, car assembly.

Vast literature as simulators are widespread in their use
- the effectiveness of a sim is defined by its ability to teach skills that transfer to the real world (Gopher, 2012).

### VR Skill acquisition has been assessed in x way
> How we learn in VR (strategy)
> Anglin & Liew
:warning: to add 2-3 studies to this section :warning:

(Anglin et al., 2017) Focused their investigation of sensorimotor learning by looking at visuomotor adaptation wherein a participant learns or “adapts” to a perturbation introduced by the experimenters in order to correctly perform a movement (Krakauer, 2009). Similar to how a sharp shooter will have to learn the rigged weighting of a carnival target practice game in order to win the prize.
The study had participants sitting at a desk viewing a computer screen in Virtual Reality and in Natural.
The study’s aims were to investigate a visuomotor adaptation and compare the strategies and adaptation acquired in VR compared with the same task in Natural.  
Implicit and explicit strategy and VR and Natural
Participants in both VR and Natural required the same time to adapt to the perturbation and reduce their errors for the task indicating that
Training block, baseline, rotation, block where participants did not receive visual feedback, then washout
n=24 (12 per group), participants were not requested to report on their previous VR experience
Hmd group felt difference with the quality of the interface statistically significant difference (p=0.064)
This will be discussed later

No significant difference in reaction time
No significant different in early or late adaption, or aftereffect (also called washout) which is the effect that having learnt the adaption has on a non-perturbed movement (similar to the colloquial experience of “sea-legs” after sailors return to land).

Anglin and colleagues found no significant difference in the pure performance of the task in that
The aiming angle was larger in the VR group compared to the natural group
The same target error

HMD-VR participants utilized a greater cognitive strategy than CT participants, and CT participants engaged in greater implicit learning than HMD-VR participants
Participants were able to adapt to perturbations in regardless of the medium
Suggested that the implicit adaptation acquired in VR may not generalize

Criticism of the  Anglin and Liew task
Habituation to VR
Mentioned this and how this may have contributed to the use of a cognitive or “explicit” strategy
Comfort may impact task performance
Visual acuity
IPD and contrast
Ocular dominance
Also just a computer screen task
** NOTE Loop in Gavin’s paper and [Saijo & Gomi, 2010](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y8kiEOodscwv8Bt0fAxU7O0h-a1qpivE)
 - how we use multiple strategies

(Lefrançois & Messier, 2019)6 targets, no feedback
True feedback
Triaxial perturbation was introduced

Subjects transfer the learned association to the real world
Smaller transfer along vertical than along the horizontal or sagittal axes

n=14
Screen and mirrors with stereoscopic glasses
Pointing movement
Seated

Familiarization
Told to work to improve their accuracy in each trial
The participants’ hand was represented by a series of white dots that indicated the hand path and by a red sphere 1cm in diameter which represented the finishing position of the participants’ pointing finger.

Verdicial or perturbed feedback

Perturbations increased by a stepwise function as this has been identified to create the most salient adaptation (Kagerer et al., 1997; Michel et al., 2007; Saijo & Gomi, 2010)

Baseline shows similar accuracy levels across each of the 3 dimensions tested (horizontal, sagittal, and vertical)
When the perturbation was introduced, subjects showed less adaptation to a vertical perturbation
More errors along the vertical axis

Gravity as a strong prior in VR/VEs (Jörges & López-Moliner, 2017; Lefrançois & Messier, 2019)


Most of the movements we do are 3D
Almost all previous studies assessing visuomotor adaptation and spatial generalization have used 2D tasks involving movements restricted to the horizontal plane. However, three-dimensional movements are biomechanically more complex than planar movements. They involve more degrees of freedom to be controlled as well as compensation for the gravitational force field which increases the proprioceptive processing demand.
A 3D skill means one must adapt and learn simultaneously across all three axes
Most studies focus on a perturbation along a single axis
This may be relevant due to postulation that adaptation to each axis is supported by separate neural mechanisms (Ghahramani & Wolpert, 1997; Krakauer et al., 2000; Messier & Kalaska, 1997, 1999; Soechting & Flanders, 1989)


### Transfer of Learning and skill

The literature on VR is dominated by research on transfer of learning in the areas of education, rehabilitation, organizational management, and surgery
(Vast literature as simulators are widespread in their use)
- the effectiveness of a sim is defined by its ability to teach skills that transfer to the real world (Gopher, 2012).

and harkens to Shepard's First law of Psychology (Shepard, 1987)
- The ability to learn in one context, and demonstrate what was learnt to a novel one


Transfer of training can be defined as the gain (or loss) in the capability for performance of one task as a result of practice on some other task (Schmidt and Lee, 1982)

#### Sports
**Gray, 2017**
CAVE with the addition of a handheld actual bat (with tracking sensor attached) - Batters received visual, auditory, and tactile feedback during the movement and at the conclusion of their movement regarding the success of their swing

i) Adaptive training in a batting VE, (ii) extra sessions of batting practice in the VE, (iii) extra on-field sessions of real batting practice, and (iv) a control condition involving no additional training to the players’ regular practice.

pre-test (2x45min)x6 weeks | 2 weeks buffer post-test. Retention tests 1mo after post-test as well as a 5 year post experiment follow up which captured the progression of the player’s career and batting statistics
So it was a study that indicated adaptive training administered in a VE was the most effective training
the results can most likely be attributed to the fact that the training was designed in a way to challenge the players (it was stepwise) rather than because it was administered in VR

- A 2010 study looked at the effect of VR with haptic feedback from movement on gait and balance, in stroke participants (Mirelman, et. al. 2010). The trainings for both groups consisted on 3 weekly, 1 hour sessions, for 4 weeks. Both groups received identical movement trainings based around dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, eversion, and combination movements; the non-VR group completed these movements at the instruction of a trainer whereas the VR group manipulated a virtually presented boat or plane towards a target. Results post analysis showed the VR group reporting greater improvement, and at faster rates, across multiple different measures. In all measures, the VR group showed significantly superior improvement, which was consistent with previous literature (Reid et. al., 2002; 2005; 2007).

- Mirelmen conducted a follow up study using a CAVE (a reflexive acronym used to describe a 4 walled 'room' that constitutes 'VR' due to the projection of an environment that is viewed through glasess using alternating shutters thus allowing projections to appear '3D'). The study investigated the efficacy of VR on gait training and motor learning in patients with Parkinson’s (Mirelman et. al., 2011). The study found a 31% improvement in all motor and gait tasks, and a significant improvement at specific tasks that were reported four times larger than the threshold for significance.These results were persistent as found in a 1 month follow up.

- VR was used by Bryanton and colleagues (2006) to assess the efficacy of using VR in motor rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. The use of the VE was to provide an engaging task, “gamifying” the rehabilitation to aid with rehabilitation protocol adherence, while also investigating the efficacy of VR to ensure exercise “correctness” which would allow for children to complete their rehabilitation at home, thus lower costs and barriers to accessing therapists.
Same rehab exercises
VRE reported more fun and higher interest/engagement
completion of the exercises with greater correctness (as determined by the length of time held in dorsiflexion)
VR participants reached a greater range of motion on average than the non-VR groups

the literature suports VR at home (for rehab) but can that be done with validity?
- VEs that can be individualized—for example, by replicating the users’ home environment or modifying stimulus presentation according to user needs and capabilities—should enhance transfer and generalization of learning (Schultheis & Rizzo, 2001).
- A study on balance (static, against perturbation, and goal directed movements), gait training, and yoga training using VR with Parkinsons patients did not find any difference between the effectiveness of the 'home-based' VR training compared to traditional 'not in VR' home training. All measures were rated equally in improving balance, walking, and quality of life. (Yang et al., 2016)


#### Surgical Training
As surgical training and assement is not the focus of the project
- would not be able to contribute past the extensive systematic reviews that have been done

Extensive systematic reviews have been conducted

### Outline the problem
> to provide evidence of project originality.


Despite the wealth of sim literature, research on modern virtual reality technologies is sparse. In the section below I have outlined ...

There is a wealth of historic and contemporary literature on non-HMD-VR that assess transfer of learning.
And yet HMDs are ubiquitous with vr training in industry  
- A Systematic Review was conducted (Analysis ongoing)
    - WIP: give numbers

Anglin et al., 2017 used HMD however
  * did not investigate Habituation to VR
  * despite Mentioning how habituation or the novelty of experiencing VR may have caused the difference in strategies reported from the results.
      * and how this may have contributed to the use of a cognitive or “explicit” strategy
  * Comfort may impact task performance
  * Visual acuity
  * IPD and contrast
  * Ocular dominance
  * Also just a computer screen task
  * ** NOTE Loop in Gavin’s paper and Saijo & Gomi, 2010
    - how we use multiple strategies

The HMD literature is largely focused on rehabilitation applications
*Majority of literature in HMD-VR is focused on rehabilitation and has been conducted on impaired or non-normative populations.*
- stroke rehab
- DMD
- CP

And all of this literature is largely conflicting on if VR training will transfer
- systematic reviews are inconclusive

Current theories cite the
- differing technologies (Molier et al., 2010)(Smith, 2019)
- differing study design that does not allow for meta-analysis or comparison of results
- poor control conditions
- small sample sizes

#### the differing technological affordances
- fidelity differences are to blame for the torn literature

high-fidelity interaction techniques usually outperform mid-fidelity techniques
the second common result was that low-fidelity interaction techniques also usually outperform mid-fidelity techniques.

A framework (based on McMahan et al. 2016) and will be included in the PhD project once analysis of the systematic review is complete.

---

#### Furthermore the assessment of VR and ToL lacks rigor (lacking matched control condition)
- There is existing literature on AR and VR technologies that assess learning when additional didactic material (such as instructional pop ups) have been added (Pletz et al. 2020).

Technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) refers to the specific features of a technology that can be used to support pedagogical methods (Mishra & Koehler, 2006).

Affordances of virtual reality technologies to make motor learning better than reality (Levac & Sveistrup, 2014)

It is widely accepted that haptic feedback, spatialized audio, and added pedagogical overlays improve learning in virtual reality (…, …) . However much in the same way that one could learn stoichiometry via a textbook, an experiment, or a podcast listened to while riding the tube; the setting itself has been demonstrated to affect the “learning” itself. I do not aim to answer why virtual reality may be better at teaching something such as chemistry, but the extent to which a task learnt in virtual reality compared to the same task being taught not in VR.

#### Lack of follow up/longitudinal
- A systematic review by (...) was done into VR  transfer
  - Gray and Mierlman are the core ones that actually follows up (cite the two systematic reviews)

#### Unknown training schedules
> Lack of clarity on training schedules (how long something needs in order to be learnt)

> do I put this section here or in methods?

Training schedules for skill learning (ie. how many sessions, for how long, at what difficulty) is a wicked problem (Rittel & Webber, 1973). There is no consensus on training schedules despite extensive literature (Kassite et al., 2019) and how training should be structured to maximize learning is still an open question (Guadagnoli and Lee, 2004). Skills themselves range in complexity and training required in order to display learning or proficiency. The pilot study aims to supplement our understanding of the literature and will be used to inform the training schedule.

- More practice trials, better learning (although there is a plateau) aka. Law of Practice (Schmidt & Lee, 2011).

- Distributed trainings are best in one study (Yanovich & Ronen. 2015).

- It has been suggested that extinction after a novel motor learning task occurs between 48-72 hours (Kozlowski, James & Schallert, 1996), however ‘skill based’ learning can occur if tasks are repeated within a 5-day paradigm (Pascual-Leone et. al., 1995).

#### Lack of knowledge about the ecological validity of remote VR
> ie. does the home environment impact transfer of learning?

To support ToL: (Boussad et al., 2008)
(1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classified according to what is learned;
(2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning;
(3) specific features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning;
(4) transfer can be used to assess a VE’s effectiveness; and
(5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning.



Based on this, the following studies are proposed to investigate transfer of learning from VR to the real world.  


## Research Questions
> to clearly state the research questions and project aims

### Intro section

As a field we need to fill in the gaps in our understanding of this technology and its uses through rigourous scientific inquiry.

### **Question 1:** Transfer of Learning from VR to Natural

### Pilot Study

A pilot study will be conducted to assess
    - how long it takes to learn (skills vary in learning timelines eg. single session, weeks, or years)
    - learning plateaus (longitudinally based motor skill learning studies often report learning plateaus, ideally this study would like to see an effect ergo data in needed)
        - if a plateau is present, it is possible to overcome those plateaus (and in what timeframe)
    - effect size
Used to pilot the schedule (spacing) and trials required if that is needed

#### Pilot schedule
```
T T S \ M W F S \ T T S \ M W F
```

Every second day for 4 weeks
- 13 sessions

### Transfer of Learning

Study 1 will address the effect training medium (VR or Natural) has on learning and further support the investigation of learning transfer between mediums.

#### Aims:

1. establish baseline learning rate
> how study 1 will assess this
> curve fitting

2. assess impact training in VR has on task performance
> outcome based


3. assess impact training in Natural has on task performance
> how study 1 will assess this

4. compare impact training medium has on skill learning
>

5. compare learning rates across mediums

### **Question 2:** Impact of learning skills in remote VR
> Study 2 & 3: remote training, remote testing, and valid behaviours

Adaptations/learnt skills may be tightly linked to the context that they were acquired in (Desmurget et al. 1997; Michel et al. 2007; Krakauer et al. 2000; Taylor and Ivry 2013)  

Two studies are proposed to investigate the impact location has on transfer
> Citations
> - [Bossard et al., 2007 ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y8kiEOodscwv8Bt0fAxU7O0h-a1qpivE)

### Study 2

#### Aims:


### Study 3

#### Aims:

### **Question 3:** How long does transfer last for/impact training medium has on skill saliency
A systematic review by (...) was done into VR  transfer
    - Gray is the core one that actually follows up

Study 4 aims to address
- It is currently unknown how VR training will affect the retention of acquired skills.

#### Aims:
1. To assess the impact training medium has on skill retention.
    - subjects from Study 1 will be asked to complete a single session follow up 4 weeks after their final session and will be sorted into two groups based on task medium (VR or Natural.) Depending on recruitment each group with have matched representation of their Study 1 groups (i.e. 50% of respondents that recieved training in a VR group in Study 1 in VR will complete Study 4 in VR and 50% in Natural).

2. To assess the impact training medium has on skill resilience
    - They will complete 2 blocks, the first on something they recognize and the second on one they don't.
    - Same training maze
    - Different testing maze


### **Question 4:** VR specific factors that impact transfer of skills (Mediating/moderating factors of VR that support the transfer of skills)
> Study 5
- depending on the results of 2 and 3, either remote research or in lab

Mediating/moderating factors of VR that support learning
- PPD and cue resolution although uncanny valley - so what is actually needed?
    - 8 bit visual scene
    - removal of depth cue
    - change friction coefficient (Laney & Mahoney: weak fusion)

Habituation
4. assess impact VR XP has on task performance
> is there a relationship between XP and performance?
> analysis of collected data from studies 1, 2, and 3.



# Methods

## Introduction
> to set up the section (ie. explain what is included) and to give rationale for own study design

The following section addresses the methodology proposed for the project separated into sections related to subjects, experimental design, materials, measures, and proposed analyses.

These sections address the "high level" methodology of the project and contains further background and rationale for the chosen methods.


### Subjects

Screening screening questionnaire to capture demographic information (age, sex, education level), previous experience with VR, gaming habits, and and previous exposure to motor learning paradigms (this is important as subjects may belong to the University of Leeds medical or dental schools and thus have recieved training on a VR simulator as part of their course).


### Recruitment strategy
Participant recruitment will have four phases based on the paradigm particpants are needed for; (1) pilot testing, (2) lab setting, (3) follow up experiment, (4) remote setting.

(1) Pilot testing subjects will be recruited from ICON and Center for Immersive Technologies at the University of Leeds as well as avalible person networks who are unfamiliar with the proposed study aims.

(2) Lab or 'in person' participants will be recruited from the University of Leeds School of Psychology, School of Engineering, School of Computing, Center for Immersive Technologies, and the Extended Reality Society. Undergraduate Psychology students recieve course credit for experimental participation and it is therefore expected for those students to represent the greatest portion of participants.

(3) Follow up participants will be recruited from the previous participant pool. Participants will be informed of an avaliable follow up experiment at the conclusion of Study 1 and given the option to register their email address to recieve sign up information.

(4) Remote or 'at home' participants will also use the recruitment channels recruitment channels from (2) with the addition of virtual VR communities (such as The Virtual World Society, Circuit Stream, ARVR Women & Allies, ARVRinEDU, VREducatorsSpatial Network, and Side Quest).



### Group Assignment

#### Blinding
The studies will not be traditionally blinded as participants would be aware of the paradigm they were being tested on (i.e. in a HMD or Natural), although participants will not be informed of other groupings across the studies.

#### Matched groups
Groups will be matched as recruitment allows based on the pre-screening questionnaire.
- VR experience
- Demographics (based on the screening questionaire)


#### Sample Size
As a novel task is proposed for the project it is difficult to definitively state the sample sizes necessary for investigation.

In order to remediate; analyses (Bayes factor) of pilot data will supplement the guidence from relevant literature in setting appropriate sample sizes.

Literature on transfer of learning from VR laparoscopic surigical trainers supports a … :warning:


Current group size is based on the effect size of ***** (citation, citation, citation).
This may require adjustment after pilot data is collected (see Gantt chart for information).
(Crochet et al., 2011) The choice of at least 10 subjects per group was based on a 2-tailed test, with α = 0.05 and power (1 – β) = 0.80, and an intended reduction of 30% in time taken to complete tasks for intervention versus control groups, based on data from previous studies of VR simulations for skill learning

### Training Schedule
Training schedules for skill learning (ie. how many sessions, for how long, at what difficulty) is a wicked problem (Rittel & Webber, 1973). There is no consensus on training schedules despite extensive literature (Kassite et al., 2019) and how training should be structured to maximize learning is still under debate (Guadagnoli and Lee, 2004). Skills themselves range in complexity and training required in order to display learning or proficiency. The pilot study aims to supplement our understanding of the literature and will be used to inform the training schedule.

## Materials

> this is important because the smallest thing going wrong might confound results
> [Craig, Bastian, & Montagne, 2011](https://scite.ai/reports/how-information-guides-movement-intercepting-MMZbY9)

### Hardware
An Oculus Quest and accompanying touch controllers will be used for VR sessions.


#### Haptics
> Resources
> https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JMBR.40.6.545-557
> Haptic feedback (in VR) has been demonstrated to improve performance
>Surgery (Kim et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2015; Panait et al., 2009) & Movement (Weller & Zachmann, 2012)


Haptics are important (citation, citation)
Questionnaires during pilot testing will collect qualitative data on perceived differences in haptic feedback quality
Citation, citation, citation indicates that the proposed use of built-in haptics from the existing VR controllers is good enough
low latency haptic feedback which was triggered by the ball hitting a VR maze wall to simulate the force feedback participants received in Natural
Force testing is not feasible in the given timeframe (nor is the required hardware available to the student) and is an avenue for further research

#### Mazes
Laser-cut mazes out of MDF measuring 350mm x 350mm x 70mm (external measurements)
Box dimensions were informed by anthropomorphic design in order to reduce the risk of ergonomically caused fatigue during trials.
- to reduce ergonomic load and therefore fatigue
- based on anthropomorphic average

    - https://multisite.eos.ncsu.edu/www-ergocenter-ncsu-edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2016/06/Anthropometric-Detailed-Data-Tables.pdf
See Appendix for mock-up

In VR conditions controllers will be affixed to the box 1/3 up from bottom edge.

#### Path Design

The sandbox will be separated into 4 quadrants which require a separate movement strategy to perform well in
- this will ensure that the task measures the motor skill that is being acquires as opposed to being confounded by or reflecting a strategy learning.


Beta testers will be used pre-pilot testing to ensure appropriate difficulty. This was determined such that a beta tester with no previous maze experience should not be able to solve the maze in under 5 minutes, and no more than 5 solves in a 12 minute time period.

#### Software
For the rendering of environment in VR, Unity 2019.4 will be used as it, at time of writing, the most stable release for VR development and recieves long-term stupport (LTS) from Unity.

##### Physics simulator
Current VR research on sensorimotor adaptation uses the inbuilt physics engines of Unity or Unreal Engine (the two main commercial platforms used for VR development). It is unknown how closely the inbulit parameters (e.g. friction coefficients) match reality, however in absence of any concerns raised by previous research, I will also use Unity’s OTS system.

If pilot data (qualitative survey responses and physics simulation benchmarking) indicates that the OTS physics engines are not sufficient, a custom physics engine was built for similar ‘marble maze’ experimentation by the author in 2017 and checked against similar materials (plywood, metal, glass, and acrylic). This engine can be updated to the current software standards and used as a better alternative to Unity’s physics simulator.
It is out of project scope to create a novel physics engine for the purposes of the proposed research.

#### DeepLab Cut
As the real world does not have the same omniscient world design, a Razer Kiyo camera will be used to capture movement data in Natural. The data will then be processed by DeepLabCut (Mathis et al 2018: 10.1038/s41593-018-0209-y)
on a computer meeting the listed requirements for DeepLabCut.

### Experimental Design


### Pilot Study
recruit 10 participants
Every second day for 4 weeks
- 13 sessions



### Study 1


#### Group Assignment
![](https://i.imgur.com/z7NBgoh.png)


#### Study 1 Design


Participants will stand holding the maze at a self-guided height/comfortable height while guiding a ball bearing around a trap maze by tilting a box. In the Natural setting, the maze will be held at opposing vertical sides of the box via Oculus touch controllers affixed to the box.

No more than 24 minutes which is the recommended time
Fatigue caused by ergonomic load (citation), and simulator sickness (citation)

The first session all participants in the VR groups will complete Oculus’ “First Encounter” in order to familiarize subjects with a VRE and the controls.

depth cues?

#### Task Performance Data
Number of attempts
Successful completions
Time to successful completion
Number, time, and location of error (errors defined by the ball falling in a hole).
Controller movement tracking (x, y, z)
Ball movement tracking
Path taken
Velocity
Acceleration

The ball movement tracking will support investigation into the path taken, velocity and acceleration, and ‘rests’ (ie. a participant uses a mazewall to rest the ball against before moving) which will provide data on rests taken, total rest time, and location of rests.


In VR these measures will be collected via software variables (Unity)


#### Participation Data
Questionnaires Pre-experiment:
- Demographic
- Mental status

Questionnaires Post-experiment:
- adapted SSQ
- percieved improvement rating
- noticed anything weird
- qualitative experience
- presence
- interview


### Analysis
A Welch t-test will be used to assess the variance between groups.

Bayes factor (evidence favors the alt vs evidence favors the null)

Graphical analysis of a learning curve (Ramsay, et al., 2001)
- regression analyses to fit a curve. Additional 'analysis of best fit' may be prudent, accordingly stepwise and exponentials models may also be used during analysis.

## Barriers to Data Collection
> to outline the barriers to data collection and to indicate that you have thought out the feasibility of the proposed plan
> to outline how I plan to execute on this plan

It is important to address the risks and barriers associated with a project that proposes the collection of new data. The following section details the barriers this project may face as well as the plans to mitigate identifed risks.
> Equipment (e.g. hardware and software), COVID-19 planning (risk assessment and contingency plans), Resource Allocation (time, compensation, )  Data Collection Barriers,

### Equipment
There are several concerns when using hardware and software
- Project feasibility and risk mitigation has been informed by a duFMEA (Stamatis, 2003) (appendix ***)
- such as failure in tracking (Deutsch et al., 2011)
    - Deutsch, J. E., Brettler, A., Smith, C., Welsh, J., John, R., Guarrera-Bowlby, P., et al. (2011). Nintendo Wii sports and Wii fi t game analysis, validation, and application to stroke rehabilitation. Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, 18 (6), 701–719.


### Experimental Design
> novel experiment (construct validity)
> Note: it will be critical to control variables ie. errors should not be coming from person, should be coming from the medium

> attrition

In addition to the above methodological design, it is important to address attrition rates when proposing multi-session human experimentation.

To mitigate the risk of participants forgetting session sign up email reminders will be sent the day before, morning of, and an hour prior.

In accordance with GDPR, permission will be requested for email contact of the participants. These email records will be stored for either 3 years, or until the completion of this student’s PhD (whichever happens first).

 If the participant does not wish for their email to be used, a confirmation of session time with be given verbally and in writing to the participant at the conclusion of each session
- e.g. "Your next session is Tuesday, the 31st of August at 8am."

As discussed in Section *** the estimated participant recruiment minimum to see an effect is ** (maybe 15).
- Budgeting for attrition rates during recruitment (ie. recruiting more participants than needed to meet the minimum sample size to find an effect)


>Task choice/Engagement

- A maze provides engagement, difficult but solvable with a defined goal (good for ‘flow’ (citation, citation)

Historically based motor learning tasks (such as cursor representation during a center-out-reach) have been used to examine motor learning strategies in VR (citation, citation, citation) and it is apparent from systematic literature reviews that there is a need for methodical rigor in this field (smith, motor, levac, m-thingy, mine, citation). Traditional reach experiments used by citation, citation, citation would not win in a war of attrition.

> resources (building space, headsets from where, hardware from where)
Compensation for Participation
- RPP
- Monetary compensation based on time spent at standard rate
- time


### Resource Allocation

The time and resources required to complete the proposed experiments is the greatest feasibility concern
> Use this section to reiterate the need for insight into feasibility of remote data collection for VR research (which will reduce hours spent in lab testing)
> time estimation



## Discussion

[Dalgarno & Lee, 2009 ](https://scite.ai/reports/what-are-the-learning-affordances-4wWDGa)


Previous studies have assessed the TPK that VR offers
VR may be better suited to learning because it does

A larger discussion of these will be explored in the dissertation
- summarize and cite pages 6-10 of [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyOijZIS5RUbcm3W4wrFZMNGcdRgURh1YiZW61UHPWQ/edit#)


What is needed to learn a skill (strictly come -> deaf)

Is it logical to assume that we would acquire skills using the same mechanisms, or is it inane to assume such owing to the fact that virtual reality is not, in fact, reality
- [pages 10 - 12 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyOijZIS5RUbcm3W4wrFZMNGcdRgURh1YiZW61UHPWQ/edit#)

### Implications
- using marble maze (this task) for ML robotic motor learning

- fills in gaps

- supports so much future work in VR
- knowing what the differences are btwen VR in lab and remote

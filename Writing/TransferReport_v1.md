## Introduction
> to explain the premise of the proposed phd project

VR is a cool technology

Since 1965 it has come a long way and is being used to do x, y, z (ie. dangerous situations)

Psychologists have been overjoyed at getting to study 'natural' behaviours (ie. do results gained in a lab actual reflect real world processes)

Two questions are outstanding
- Does it transfer
    - Without indication that tasks transfer, VR may not be an appropriate medium for training. This is of particular concern when we're using VR as a subtitute training environment for highly dangerous situations.  
- Does the ‘ecologically valid’ claim have validity || Virtual reality can be lauded by its offer ... the potential for researchers to deliver and examine “real-life tasks” in a laboratory-based experiment. But do those “real life” experiments actually reflect real world (ie. out of lab) behaviour?
    - I.e. can we do remote VR


> clearly state the research question

2 Research Themes that the studies proposed herein seek to address
- Can we transfer skills learnt in VR to Natural
- Remote research


## Skill Learning Background
>  literature review for ToL

Transfer of learning from VR to natural has been assessed in knowledge transfer, conflict resolution, mathematics training
- dominated by skill training

Baseball, crane operation, car assembly.

Vast literature as simulators are widespread in their use
- the effectiveness of a sim is defined by its ability to teach skills that transfer to the real world (Gopher, 2012).


#### What is learning
Learning is typically defined as a relatively permanent change in a person’s capability to perform a skill (Schmidt & Lee, 2005).  

#### What is a skill?
I am defining skill by 1) something not known prior/something new, 2) able to be measured, 3) able to be improved through training (Adams, 1987)



#### Sports


#### Rehabilitation


**richest area of research has been the training of surgeons**
#### Surgical Training
Extensive systematic reviews have been conducted


#### Sensorimotor/Visuomotor


### Outline the problem
> to provide evidence of project originality.


Despite the wealth of sim literature, research on modern virtual reality technologies is sparse

There is a wealth of historic and contemporary literature on non-HMD-VR that assess transfer of learning.
And yet HMDs are ubiquitous with vr training in industry  
- A Systematic Review was conducted (Analysis ongoing)
    - WIP: give numbers

The HMD literature is largely focused on rehabilitation applications
*Majority of literature in HMD-VR is focused on rehabilitation and has been conducted on impaired or non-normative populations.*
- stroke rehab
- DMD
- CP

And all of this literature is largely conflicting
- Assumed that VR is good enough
- But the literature is torn

A possible explanation for this is the
- differing technologies, differing tasks
- (Smith, 2019)

#### FIFA
A near parabolic or 'uncanny valley' due to simulator fidelity may explain some of the conflict (4x uncanny valley citations)

A framework (based on McMahan et al. 2016) and will be included in the PhD project once analysis is complete.


Furthermore the assessment of VR and ToL lacks rigor (lacking matched control condition)
- There is existing literature on AR and VR technologies that assess learning when additional didactic material (such as instructional pop ups) have been added (Pletz et al. 2020)  

## Remote Research Background

It would be naive to present a transfer report on HMD-VR literature without noting the "unprescedented" times (either - https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1425138850012168196 or BoJo) in which this PhD is being completed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mass causality, insummountable suffering, and for those who are left; global devastation that we shall be reaping throughout our lifetime.

It is not a silver lining that 'humanity came together in support' and it would be irreverent at best to claim that the maladies caused by the pandemic ****

Open Science practices boomed and infrustrature rose to meet it (citation)

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychometric and *** experiments moved to online mediums (Tsay, …. …. ….)

Unlike its counterparts, virtual reality experiments were halted due to hardware requirements of such experiments (ie. needing a HMD), and the potential cross-contamination concerns of sharing physical lab equipment between subjects.

A number of papers have been published on the construct validity of using remote proxies for collecting movement data (eg. keyboard and mouse) (....., .....). However it is as yet unknown if the factors found in an ‘out of lab’ virtual reality environment would confound or impact the validity of experimental results.

Allow the examination of experimental bias from “in lab”, and how that bias may VR affect the results seen and published within our field.

The studies proposed aim to contribute insight into this question.




## Project Aims
> to clearly state the research questions and project aims

### Intro section

As a field we need to fill in the gaps in our understanding of this technology and its uses through rigourous scientific inquiry.

### Key questions
Research Theme 1: Can we transfer skills learnt in VR to Natural


Research Theme 2: Can HMD based virtual reality experiments be conducted remotely and be valid for research purposes.

* Did one learn?
* Did one improve across trainings?
* What other behaviours are affected by those improvements (generalization)
* Can those improvements be observed in environments other than the one they were made in? (transfer)
* How long did those improvements last?


### How I plan to answer these questions
> to outline the experimental plan before getting into methods

A 3 phase plan to address the above questions.

Study 1 aims to assess transfer of learning by comparing performance and learning rates between VR in Natural laboratory settings on a novel task. The specific questions and hypotheses are below
*

Study 2 assesses the impact training 'at home in VR' has on performance. The specific questions and hypotheses are below
*



Study 3 will directly compare VR settings (either at home or in the lab) on task performance and outcome. As with above, the specific questions and hypotheses for study 3 are below:

- H0: the setting of the VR experiments has no impact on task performance and results
- H1: the setting has a statistically relevant impact on task performance and outcome

"Improving human interactions in complex product development","O. Waller; F. Isnard; G. Dodds","Dept. of Electr. & Electron.

Current VR software packages do not yet offer an idea solution to the problem of creating realistic virtual prototypes. This problem is especially true for large industrial products such as in the aerospace industry. These large products would especially benefit from virtual prototyping in areas such as maintenance, assembly and training. It is important to minimise the preparation and evaluation time in these short production runs and individually specified products. Three areas are examined: data reduction, economic conversion costs and real time implementation methods are discussed. These include task based reduction and more general compression methods. The use of human factors with intelligent responsive manikins is outlined along with a range of desirable features. Real environments require complex interactions and open systems with user specified code and debugging. The state of some VR systems are described and it is shown how research in these areas can overcome the current limitations of industrial virtual reality packages. The work is based on experience with large models, multiple VR packages and manikin interactions.","","","10.1049/ic:19980753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=744430","","","virtual reality","human interactions;complex product development;virtual reality;virtual prototypes;electrical properties;mechanical properties;aesthetic properties;ergonomic properties;design stage;software packages;virtual prototyping;maintenance;assembly;training;data reduction;economic conversion costs;real time implementation methods;task based reduction;compression methods;human factors;intelligent responsive manikins;open systems;complex interactions;user specified code;debugging;industrial virtual reality packages;large models","","2","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Suitable representation of data is a critical aspect to achieve best results. Therefore, we developed an interactive visualization scheme especially for the representation of cardiac arrhythmias based on a conventional mobile device and virtual reality (VR) goggles (Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR) in combination with a game engine. The aim of this paper is to raise awareness for this new technique, evaluate its potential and propose a general workflow for such a visualization environment. The use of a conventional mobile device in combination with VR goggles creates a portable and low-cost system, equipped with enough processing power and pixel density for many types of applications. The user can interact with the data through head movement or a secondary controller As current game engines support a wide range of additional input methods and controllers, the interaction method can be customized to fit the target audience. To evaluate this method, we conducted a survey with eight typical phenomena from the field of cardiac arrhythmias. The participants were asked to rate different performance aspects on a scale from one (very bad) to five (very good). All participants (N=27) rated the performance as fluent (median=5). Furthermore, most participants (70%) ranked the overall impression as very good (median=5). On the long run, the system can be used for education and presentations as well as improved planning and guidance of medical procedures.","2325-887X","978-1-5090-0895-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868934","","Data visualization;Engines;Mobile handsets;Games;Computational modeling;Eye protection;Solid modeling","biomechanics;cardiology;computer games;medical disorders;medical image processing;mobile handsets;virtual reality","virtual reality-based visualization;cardiac arrhythmias;mobile devices;human physiology;anatomy;diagnostics;medical treatments;data representation;interactive visualization scheme;mobile device;VR goggles;Google Cardboard VR;Samsung Gear VR;game engine;pixel density;processing power;head movement;secondary controller","","","","9","","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address these shortcomings by presenting a system to augment printed maps with digital graphical information and user interface components. These augmentations complement the properties of the printed information in that they are dynamic, permit layer selection and provide complex computer mediated interactions with geographically embedded information and user interface controls.

Its focus lies on the visualization of a probabilistic robot localization algorithm considering noise in the sensors and actuators of the robot on the one hand, as well as an environment filled with obstacles which damage the robot on contact on the other hand. The goal of the simulation is training students on the intricacies of the algorithm and to develop a notion on the impact of the considered factors such as the degree of sustained sensory noise. In order to facilitate learning and promote exploration, we embed a game mode that conveys the basic interactions with the simulator and the factors shaping the robot's behavior. In the game, the player helps the simulated robot to reach its destination with as little damage as possible. This is done by setting waypoints for the robot by adjusting the parameters of the deployed localization algorithm as well as the quality of sensors and the accuracy of the robots movements. By playing with these parameters, the user playfully learns their effects, which are visualized in 3D - contrary to the hard mathematical approach presented in books. SkyNetz also has the capacity to communicate with a real robot, to show its current position and position estimates. In the long run, this will provide the foundation for novel augmented reality games. The paper includes a general introduction to the topic of interactive robot simulation, background on the specific problem of localization estimation, the presentation of our approach and the results from a small user study.","","978-1-5090-2722-4","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2016.7590365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590365","","Robot sensing systems;Collision avoidance;Kalman filters;Games;Probabilistic logic","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;data visualisation;digital simulation;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;probability","Skynetz;playful experiential robotics simulator;playful interactive robotics simulator;computer science students;probabilistic robot localization algorithm;actuators;training students;sensory noise;game mode;robot behavior;3D visualization;augmented reality games;localization estimation problem","","","","9","","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing federate compliance test approaches that adopted dynamic compiling methods are difficult and complicated in using and realization. Based on the former test experience, a new method is brought forward in this paper. It uses the General Simulation Data Collect (GSDC) Technique which exchanges the data with Federate Under Test (FUT) by dynamic publication and subscription of objects and interactions.

From the perspective of simulation, a future Web will be full of simulation models and large amounts of simulation-generated data. Many of the models will include two or three dimensional animation as well as virtual reality. Others will allow human interaction with simulation models to control or influence their execution no matter where the user is located in the world. Analysis of data from Web-based simulations involves greater degrees of freedom than traditional simulations. The number of simulation models available and the amount of simulation data are likely to be much greater. In order to assure the quality of data, the execution of models under a variety of scenarios should be well managed. Since the user community will also be larger, quality assurance should be delegated to agents responsible for defining scenarios and executing models. A major element of simulation analysis is the analysis of output data, which manages the execution of simulation models, in order to obtain statistical data of acceptable quality.

To minimize user's cognitive load during interaction, a semantics-based optimization mechanism was used to find the best mapping between icons and functionalities and to expand the set of valid commands. The framework was evaluated by using it with see-through glasses for AR-based maintenance and repair operations. A set of experimental tests were designed to objectively and subjectively assess first-time user experience of the automatically generated interface in relation to that of a fully personalized interface. Moreover, intuitiveness of the automatically generated interface was studied by analyzing the results obtained through trained users on the same interface. Objective measurements (in terms of false positives, false negatives, task completion rate, and average number of attempts for activating functionalities) and subjective measurements (about system response accuracy, likeability, cognitive demand, annoyance, habitability, and speed) reveal that the results obtained by the first-time users and experienced users with the proposed framework's interface are very similar, and their performances are comparable with those of both the considered references.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2016.2573830","EASE-RÂ³; FoF.NMP.2013-8; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7494916","Augmented reality (AR);automatic user interface generation;semantics;speech;virtual reality (VR);wearable devices","Speech;Maintenance engineering;Visualization;Speech recognition;Semantics;Face","augmented reality;graphical user interfaces;natural language interfaces;optimisation;speech recognition;speech synthesis","automatic speech interface generation;wearable augmented reality applications;graphic interface;personalized interface;first-time user experience;AR-based repair;AR-based maintenance;see-through glasses;semantics-based optimization;user cognitive load minimization;speech recognizer;grammar;vocabulary;application functionalities;general-purpose icons;natural language descriptions;wearable virtual reality applications","","9","","63","","20 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, the object interactions are application independent and only a single scheme is required to handle all interactions in the virtual world. In order to have more dynamic interactions, we also created a new and efficient way for human users to dynamically interact within virtual worlds through their avatar. In particular, we show how inverse kinematics can be used to increase the interaction possibilities and realism in collaborative virtual environments. This results in a higher feeling of presence for connected users and allows for easy, on-the-fly creation of new interactions.

This presentation will highlight clinical cases and empirical results from virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation programs at two military medical facilities. These programs utilize VR environments to detect and treat functional deficits often difficult to address with standard clinical methods. Injured service members seen at these facilities are often young and highly fit at the time of their injuries. Their injuries include single and multiple limb traumas such as amputation, burns, and limb salvage. Despite the severity of these injuries and associated co-morbidities, these individuals commonly set rehabilitation goals that include a return to competitive sports and/or military duty. Deficits described by these individuals, that can limit the achievement of these goals, can be difficult to detect and quantify with conventional clinical measures. Novel VR-based assessments, developed by our clinical research team, have helped identify functional deficits across multiple domains using ecologically-valid tasks. Further, VR-based treatment applications have been designed to address these deficits and progress patients toward their goals. In general, we have found that service members following traumatic brain injury, amputation, and severe limb trauma demonstrate significant increases in function with VR therapies. These VR interventions are based on well-established therapeutic techniques and can be used to promote functional interactions with challenging environments while maintaining full safeties and controls.","2331-9569","978-1-4799-8984-3","10.1109/ICVR.2015.7358631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358631","","Extremities;Virtual reality;Standards;Brain injuries;Medical treatment;Safety","injuries;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","virtual reality-based assessment;treatment intervention;combat-injured service member;virtual reality-based rehabilitation program;military medical facility;virtual reality environment;multiple limb trauma;amputation;limb salvage;competitive sport;military duty;traumatic brain injury;virtual reality therapY","","","","","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The significance of individual-specific factors, such as general trait anxiety and personality, as well as contextual factors, such as age, gender, highest education, and native language, in moderating the association between bio-behavioral indices and PSA is further examined through group-based machine learning models. Results highlight the importance of including such factors for detecting PSA with the proposed group-based PSA models yielding Spearman's correlation of 0.55(p <; 0.05) between the actual and predicted state-based anxiety scores.

To improve the quality of such information, AR systems need to identify the object with which the user is interacting. AR systems today heavily rely on computer vision for object identification; however, state-of-the-art computer vision systems can only identify the general object categories, rather than their precise identity. In this work, we propose IDCam, a system that fuses RFID and computer vision for precise item identification in AR object-oriented interactions. IDCam simultaneously tracks users' hands using a depth camera and generates motion traces for RFID-tagged objects.

From this, the spatio-temporal modeling represents many difficulties. The main goal of our work is to solve this problem in the biological domain and particularly the spatio-temporal modeling and visualisation of molecular and functional network. In order to do that, we propose a system based on multiagent system with the virtual reality allowing the user to interact with the three-dimensional image objects. As a computer-generated representation of a three-dimensional environment, virtual reality enables the user to view and manipulate the contents of an environment. Virtual reality is often referred to as the technology that gives a user the experience of being immersed in a computer-generated virtual world.

I-GMS is designed to meet two important goals: generality and interactivity. By generality, we mean a dynamic simulator which can easily support various systems of rigid bodies, ranging from a single free-flying rigid object to complex linkages such as those needed for robotic systems or human body simulation. To provide this generality, we have developed I-GMS in an object-oriented framework. The user interactivity is supported through a haptic interface for articulated bodies, introducing interactive dynamic simulation schemes. This user-interaction is achieved by performing push and pull operations via the PHANToM haptic device, which runs as an integrated part of I-GMS. Also, a hybrid scheme was used for simulating internal contacts (between bodies in the multirigid-body system) in the presence of friction, which could avoid the nonexistent solution problem often faced when solving contact problems with Coulomb friction. In our hybrid scheme, two impulse-based methods are exploited so that different methods are applied adaptively, depending on whether the current contact situation is characterized as ""bouncing"" or ""steady."" We demonstrate the user-interaction capability of I-GMS through online editing of trajectories of a 6-degree of freedom (dof) articulated structure.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.818434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275525","","Object oriented modeling;Biological system modeling;Haptic interfaces;Friction;Virtual prototyping;Virtual environment;Couplings;Robots;Humans;Imaging phantoms","multi-robot systems;mobile robots;digital simulation;object-oriented methods;haptic interfaces;virtual reality","interactive dynamic simulation;multirigid bodies;prototype simulator;Interactive Generalized Motion Simulator;virtual environments;free-flying rigid object;robotic systems;human body simulation;object-oriented framework;haptic interface;articulated bodies;PHANTOM haptic device;impulse-based methods","Algorithms;Biomechanics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Joints;Models, Biological;Movement;Nonlinear Dynamics;Robotics;User-Computer Interface","14","","62","","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the application of AR for general devices such as Android smartphones that do not have depth sensors, virtual objects are added without having depth information from the real world so that virtual content is always displayed in front of or on top of real objects and causes Occlusion problems. Occlusion refers to the problem when real objects that are closer to the user are covered by more distant virtual objects. This research formulates the handling of the Occlusion problem using the Model-Based Occlusion method in which the geometry information of the model from real objects must be known and registered in advance to the system. To maintain the suitability of the model's geometry information with its real object, Tracking is needed.

Based on experience with the Virginia Tech CAVE augmented by a literature search, we propose three key requirements for successful CAVE-based simulations: (1) portability among CAVE-specific input/output devices, (2) effective and efficient interprocess communication, and (3) overcoming the limitations associated with input/output device interaction.

In particular, our method can insert animated virtual objects into a static scene, with geometric consistency, and also allow the user to interactively position and rotate the virtual objects with respect to a world coordinate system in a physically (or intuitively) meaningful way. Such capability cannot be achieved by using the existing calibration-free methods. To achieve this goal, we develop a new method for estimating camera parameters, which uses a cuboid structure (or more generally, a parallelepiped structure) as the reference object. The reference cuboid structure can be either explicit or implicit-implicit in the sense that the cuboid structure can be inferred by human perception even though it does not appear explicitly in the image. This method can determine the sizes of the cuboid (or parallelepiped) as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera. To insert a virtual object into a single uncalibrated image, some human interaction is unavoidable. We have implemented an AR authoring system based on the proposed PCS method which provides an auxiliary line and a refinement criterion to assist human interaction. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method can successfully insert virtual objects into both static and dynamic scenes with highly convincing geometric consistency.","","0-7695-0164-8","10.1109/ICCV.1999.791194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=791194","","Augmented reality","augmented reality;computer animation;computational geometry;parameter estimation;cameras;authoring systems","calibration-free approach;augmented reality;parameterized cuboid structure;PCS;animated virtual objects;static scene;geometric consistency;world coordinate system;camera parameter estimation;cuboid structure;parallelepiped structure;reference object;reference cuboid structure;human perception;extrinsic parameters;virtual object;single uncalibrated image;human interaction;AR authoring system;auxiliary line;refinement criterion;dynamic scenes","","11","1","18","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the mechanisms of navigating within a virtual environment have primarily been constrained to handheld input devices akin to gaming controllers. For people unfamiliar with traditional gaming input devices, VR navigation devices are not intuitively mapped to real-world modes of locomotion and can be frustrating and disorienting. Designers have largely focused on utility (the ability to efficiently accomplish a task) to the detriment of usability (ease of use). The industry lacks an intuitive, universal method of navigation that can be easily learned by novice participants. Dr. Jakob Nielsen identified five factors that impact usability in human-computer interactions (HCI): learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Previous research in virtual environment locomotion incorporated teaching time periods where the researchers explained the control devices to participants. We believe that this neglected one of the key usability factors in human-computer interactions: learnability, or the ability and ease to accomplish a task the first time a user encounters it. Our research focuses on comparing existing modes of navigation (game controller based) with a mode of controller-less fully embodied navigation between two demographics based on Nielsen's usability factors. Existing research has demonstrated little noticeable learnability difference between modes of rotation and lean-based navigation, and joystick navigation in VR [1]; however, similar study demonstrates that partially embodied leaning mechanics can positively affect sensory perception in VR [2]. While previous Studies in controller-less VR navigation methods have demonstrated an inclination toward subject motion sickness when controllers are removed [3], other research has yielded positive qualitative results (sans motion sickness) when partially embodied alternative controller systems are used [4]. Additional research into partially embodied alternative controller systems has, in fact, indicated a preference toward existing modes of controller-based joystick navigation in VR subjects [5]; however, when partially embodied leaning mechanics are combined with another mode of sensory perception, like foot haptics, self-motion perception (vection) is enhanced [6]. In this study, we test a fully embodied mode of navigation to evaluate whether a fully engaged body experiences more positive usability results according to HCI measures. We test our results within communities of self-identified gamers and non-gamers, evaluating navigation modes designed for joystick control pads, trigger-based teleportation, and controller-less embodied navigation. Our research inquires whether embodied navigation enhances usability in accordance with Nielsen's usability factors, specifically enabling easier access and engagement for inexperienced subj e ct s, compared with controller-based modes of navigation.","","978-1-5386-6304-2","10.1109/GEM.2018.8516499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8516499","","Navigation;Hardware;Games;Media;Usability;Virtual environments","computer games;human computer interaction;interactive devices;navigation;teaching;user interfaces;virtual reality","virtual reality environments;gaming controllers;VR navigation devices;real-world modes;human-computer interactions;virtual environment locomotion incorporated teaching time periods;control devices;key usability factors;game controller;Nielsen's usability factors;partially embodied leaning mechanics;controller-less VR navigation methods;controller-based joystick navigation;fully embodied mode;joystick control pads;controller-based modes;navigation modes;alternative controller systems;gaming input devices","","1","","6","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, cognitive skills are highly demanded for novice surgeons to thoroughly interpret the relative positions between tool and tissue in images and make appropriate decisions about further catheter motions in case of collisions. In this paper, an operator's cognitive skills training system has been introduced, which exploits the tactile sensation to reinforce the visualized spatial positions between catheter tip and vascular wall in the VR simulator. In cooperation with the collision alert module (CAM) in the VR simulator, the newly developed catheter manipulator can provide tactile sensations for novices when catheter tip is threaded beyond safety boundary, so that the VR exhibited tool-tissue interaction can be deliberately intensified. For demonstrating such tactile sensations adequate to strengthen visions, the system model has been established to facilitate the analysis in the perspective of operator's kinesthetic perception. A series of experiments have been conducted at last and the results reveal that the catheter manipulator can not only realize the accurate catheter motions but also provide the enough tactile sensations for novices. Moreover, statistical data prove that subjects under cognitive trainings have developed the ability to interpret the relative spatial positions between catheter tip and vascular wall.

Multimodal interaction is part of this research. It allows conveying to the users information through different sensory channels. The use of more modalities than touch and vision augments the sense of presence in the virtual environment and can be useful to present the same information in various ways. In addition, multimodal interaction can sometimes be used to augment the perception of the user by transferring information that is not generally perceived in the real world, but which can be emulated by the virtual environment. The paper presents a prototype of a system that allows designers to evaluate the quality of a shape with the aid of touch, vision and sound. Sound is used to communicate geometrical data, relating to the virtual object, which are practically undetectable through touch and vision. In addition, the paper presents the preliminary work carried out on this prototype and the results of the first tests made in order to demonstrate the feasibility. The problems related to the development of this kind of application and the realization of the prototype itself are highlighted. This paper also focuses on the potentialities and the problems relating to the use of multimodal interaction, in particular the auditory channel.","","978-1-4244-2668-3","10.1109/HAVE.2008.4685315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685315","haptic;audio & visual sensors and displays;human-computer interaction","Haptic interfaces;Prototypes;Virtual environment;Product design;Shape control;Virtual reality;Application software;Conferences;Humans;Virtual prototyping","computational geometry;data visualisation;haptic interfaces;human computer interaction;virtual reality","sound interface;tangible interface;shape evaluation;shape modification;virtual prototyping;interactive system;multimodal human computer interaction;sensory channel;virtual object geometrical data;auditory channel;haptic system;visualization system","","8","1","18","","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These simulators execute primarily in real time because of the human-in-the-loop requirements. The future of DIS in the general area of distributed simulation will include non real time simulations, such as constructive wargames. Active research in the area of parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) has devised means by which event driven simulations can be parallelized, by utilizing state of the art parallel architectures and scheduling events which can be executed concurrently and in a conflict-free fashion. Simulation has experienced growth in both these communities. Each community has specific needs and requirements which have to be met. This paper examines the areas of DIS in which PDES techniques may be employed to achieve more parallelism. In particular, this paper addresses the need for, and implementation of synchronization in current DIS networks.

Stereo-rendering of camera feed and overlaid information on smartphone helps us experience AR with GC. These frugal devices have limited user-input capability, allowing user interactions with GC such as head tilting, magnetic trigger and conductive lever. Our paper proposes a reliable and intuitive gesture based interaction technique for these frugal devices. The hand gesture recognition employs the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) based on human skin pixels and tracks segmented foreground using optical flow to detect hand swipe direction for triggering a relevant event. Realtime performance is achieved by implementing the hand gesture recognition module on a smartphone and thus reducing the latency.

The research challenges lie in the development of real-time data-transmission, instantaneous analysis of data coming from different inputs, local intelligences in low power embedded system, interaction with augmented reality in multiple on-site users, complex interfaces, and portability. The proposed architecture is allocated with modular form. The prototype of this modular device is named a PSS (Personnel Supervision System) module. The hardware of the modular system includes with many sensor modules, cameras, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors, processors, Wi-Fi module, laser, LED light plus its associated software. The mobile PSS module is responsible for local data processing for various sensors, image processing, 3D pose estimation, audio data acquisition, visualization and wireless interfaced devices. The advantage of modular concept is that it can work independently or together. The Head Mounted Display (HMD) includes HW and SW to communicate the augmented reality content to the user and to display visual information on a worker's field of view (FOV). The module serves as a supervision post, providing sensor data, video and audio stream to the supervisor. It stores data and provide the means for the supervisor to easily communicate and instruct the worker. It decides, selects and serves the AR (Augmented) content on multiple PTUs, automatically or with minor supervisor intervention. The development of this system to be compatible with a wearable use in a highly challenging environment presents an excellent opportunity to integrate today's leading technical knowledge in a product which can become accessible to industry and general public.

However, this is not the case. There are many factors that may affect the comprehension of lectures in the classroom including class size, visibility of the whiteboard, student's level of concentration, student's level of comprehension to name a few. Our main aim is to find a better way to offer the best education experience for students using the latest innovative solutions in technology. During our survey of Virtual Reality (VR) applications, we identified several readily available applications most of which were related to either medical education, tourism or other domains of sciences. None of the applications were available for general education where a complete classroom is transported into virtual reality. In this paper, we developed a VR framework that enhances the learning experience of students who face difficulties in the classroom. Moreover, we developed a complete prototype system to validate the framework. The proposed framework makes learning immersive, interactive and narrative offering enhanced motivation to students. The prototype system setup involves setting up a camera in the classroom to capture the whiteboard. Visuals from the whiteboard augmented with the course material (lecture slides) are compiled together to create a virtual space for the students. Students can interact with the virtual classroom by a provided set of tools in the virtual space. The VR application is developed using Unity 3D Engine and interaction is implemented using a handheld Bluetooth device.","","978-1-5386-4110-1","10.1109/NCG.2018.8593095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593095","Virtual reality in education;Classroom VR;3D Engine","Education;Virtual reality;Aerospace electronics;Prototypes;Engines;Streaming media;Visualization","computer aided instruction;educational courses;interactive systems;virtual reality","interactive immersive lectures;education experience;general education;VR framework;learning experience;course material;virtual space;virtual classroom;VR application;education system;virtual reality applications","","1","","20","","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, many of the results found in the haptic feedback literature cannot be replicated independently. With experimental results, the paper demonstrates that ""off the shelf,"" general purpose robotics equipment can be incorporated into an effective haptic/kinesthetic feedback system. Such a system can accommodate a wide variety of virtual reality applications including training and telerobotics.

Since many of the multifunction touch screen controls (TSCs) being considered for the flight deck are multi-touch, it is important that their usability and human factors considerations be studied in realistic aviation environments. A study was conducted to help understand the impact of multi-touch display location, display inclination angle, and gesture type on task performance, as well as workload and fatigue, for single pilots flying a flight simulator in moderate turbulence conditions. Two preliminary studies were conducted in order to inform a larger single pilot multi-touch study. A preliminary gesture study explored seventeen touch gestures and identified a subset of nine gestures to use in the larger single pilot study. A preliminary inclination study assessed the impact of inclination angle on pilot performance while using touch gestures. The main single-pilot study sought to further explore pilot performance using multi-touch gestures by incorporating the results from both preliminary studies in the context of flight simulation with turbulence. Electromyography (EMG) was used to capture muscle activations at the forearm and shoulder as an indicator of potential fatigue. Tasks included gestures performed on instrument approach procedures (IAP), maps, on a menu and application driven interface, and on a fuel balance interface. Dependent measures included time on task; number of touches to completion, perceptions of workload and fatigue, readability rating, objective fatigue via EMG, maintenance of flight indices, and ratings questionnaires. The results of this study revealed various human factors implications associated with the application of multi-touch screen controls in the flight deck. Generally, both time on task and the number of gesture attempts before successful task completion were elevated for gestures requiring more than two digits. In addition, gestures requiring more than two digits have greater potential to obscure touch targets and flight deck display information. These gestures were often awkward to complete even in a static environment; this may worsen in flight, especially in turbulent conditions. For completing touch screen tasks with gestures, pilots preferred four of the presented display inclination angles. Touch gestures performed at the upper multifunction display (MFD) location often required pilots to âlean forwardâ or stretch by bending at the waist and lifting their back off the seat to achieve the reach needed. This implies greater propensity for issues with fatigue. The results are intended to help inform the development of guidelines and recommendations for the integration of multi-touch screen controls into flight decks.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081723","multifunction display;multi-touch screen controls","","electromyography;fatigue;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;occupational health;touch sensitive screens","gesture type;multifunction flight deck controls;multifunction touch screen;multitouch display location;fatigue;flight simulator;multitouch gestures;flight simulation;multitouch screen;touch screen tasks;electromyography;muscle activations;EMG","","","","11","","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system we will describe has been derived from the new generation of games, but for the first time, it has been applied to VR environments dedicated to Cultural Heritage (CH) and experimented with inside museums. Interesting research focused on the definition of a new grammar of gestures is in progress, allowing more and more complexity, but with natural interchanges and connections between real and virtual worlds. An important development in this field has been realized in the framework of the Etruscanning project, a European project (Culture 2007) whose aim is to explore the possibilities of new visualization techniques, in order to re-create and restore the original context of the Etruscan graves.

These distortions ideally permit users to explore large and potentially unbounded virtual worlds while walking naturally through a physically limited space. Estimates of the physical space required to perform effective redirected walking have been based largely on the ability of humans to perceive the distortions introduced by redirected walking and have not examined the impact the overall steering strategy used. This work compares four generalized redirected walking algorithms, including Steer-to-Center, Steer-to-Orbit, Steer-to-Multiple-Targets and Steer-to-Multiple+Center. Two experiments are presented based on simulated navigation as well as live-user navigation carried out in a large immersive virtual environment facility. Simulations were conducted with both synthetic paths and previously-logged user data. Primary comparison metrics include mean and maximum distances from the tracking area center for each algorithm, number of wall contacts, and mean rates of redirection. Results indicated that Steer-to-Center out-performed all other algorithms relative to these metrics.

First, the proposed 6-DoF manipulation method (3-DoF translation and 3-DoF rotation) exploits various embedded sensor information of the smartphone. Transfer functions are then designed to transfer the phone's 6-DoF control gain to the 3D display space's object manipulation gain.

Based on detailed discussion on the theory of particle system, the general particle system model for special effect simulation is designed, and its concrete implementation is presented. By capturing common features of various effects and carefully structuring into the model composition, the model can be reuse in different effects simulation with little modification, making it an efficient way to create various convincing special effects in virtual battlefield environment.

This work extends the virtual manipulator concept, to allow haptic interaction with more complex virtual objects. The time varying virtual manipulator developed here constrains the end effector of a robot to trace along a NURBS surface. This virtual mechanism provides interaction forces consistent with the sensation of contacting the surface.

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads. The dyads experiment in a physical human-human interaction (pHHI) scenario to move an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment to reach predefined goal configurations. In this study, we propose a sliding-window approach for feature extraction and demonstrate the online classification methodology to identify interaction patterns. We evaluate our approach using 1) a support vector machine classifier (SVMc) and 2) a Gaussian Process classifier (GPc) for multi-class classification, and achieve over 80% accuracy with both classifiers when identifying general interaction types.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2945261","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854968","Classification;Feature Extraction;Force and Tactile Sensing;Haptics and Haptic Interfaces;Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop;Learning and Adaptive Systems;Physical Human-Human Interaction;Physical Human-Robot Interaction;Recognition","Task analysis;Collaboration;Haptic interfaces;Feature extraction;Robots;Microsoft Windows;Taxonomy","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;image classification;robot vision;support vector machines;virtual reality","interaction state;physical interactions;interaction patterns;physical human-human interaction;general interaction types;interaction behaviors;collaborative object transfer;joint object transfer;online identification;haptic data;industrial settings;object co-manipulation;haptics-enabled virtual environment;sliding-window approach;feature extraction;online classification methodology;support vector machine classifier;SVMc;Gaussian process classifier;multiclass classification;general interaction type identification;automatic classification mechanism","","","","27","IEEE","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These objects are not necessarily directly related to the task at hand, and the movement of an object might even be entirely unintentional. If another person is touching the object at the same time, the movement can transfer through the object and be experienced - however subtly - by the other person. For example, when one person hands a drink to another, at some point both individuals will be touching the glass, and consequently exerting small (often unnoticed) forces on the other person. Despite the frequency of such subtle incidental movements of shared objects in everyday interactions, few have examined how these movements affect human-virtual human (VH) interaction. We ran an experiment to assess how presence and social presence are affected when a person experiences subtle, incidental movement through a shared real-virtual object. We constructed a real-virtual room with a table that spanned the boundary between the real and virtual environments. The participant was seated on the real side of the table, which visually extended into the virtual world via a projection screen, and the VH was seated on the virtual side of the table. The two interacted by playing a game of âTwenty Questions,â where one player asked the other a series of 20 yes/no questions to deduce what object the other player was thinking about. During the game, the âwobblyâ group of subjects experienced subtle incidental movements of the real-virtual table: the entire real-virtual table tilted slightly away/toward the subject when the virtual/real human leaned on it. The control group also played the same game, except the table did not wobble. Results indicate that the wobbly group had higher presence and social presence with the virtual human in general, with statistically significant increases in presence, co-presence, and attentional allocation. We present the experiment and results, and discuss some potential implications for virtual human systems and some potential future studies.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-0836-0","10.1109/VR.2016.7504683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7504683","H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems â Artificial, Augmented and Virtual Realities;J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences â Psychology","Electronic mail;Measurement by laser beam;Virtual environments;Games;Training;Haptic interfaces;Force","human computer interaction;virtual reality","wobbly table;social presence;real-virtual table;subtle incidental movement;object movement;human-virtual human interaction;human-VH interaction;shared real-virtual object;real-virtual room;projection screen;virtual world;Twenty Questions game","","17","","42","","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lastly, the effectiveness of this remote interaction with respect to the human users as an interactive gaming system with their pets/friends (hamster) was examined based on Csikszentmihalyi's Flow theory. Results of both studies inform of positive remote interaction between human users and their pet friends using our research system.

While early approaches have used three-dimensional rendering on standard two-dimensional displays, recently researchers have started to use head-mounted displays to visualize software cities in immersive virtual reality systems (IVRS). For IVRS of a higher order it is claimed that they offer a higher degree of engagement and immersion as well as more intuitive interaction. On the other hand, spatial orientation may be a challenge in IVRS as already reported by studies on the use of IVRS in domains outside of software engineering such as gaming, education, training, and mechanical engineering or maintenance tasks. This might be even more true for the city metaphor for visualizing software. Software is immaterial and, hence, has no natural appearance. Only a limited number of abstract aspects of software are mapped onto visual representations so that software cities generally lack the details of the real world, such as the rich variety of objects or fine textures, which are often used as clues for orientation in the real world. In this paper, we report on an experiment in which we compare navigation in a particular kind of software city (EvoStreets) in two variants of IVRS.

Researchers apply the Cognitive-developmental theory and children's information seeking behaviors into the invention of a mixed-reality futuristic library for children using cutting-edge technologies. We first created a visualized children's book classified system using facet structured thesaurus, and employed beacon indoor positioning technologies to locate categorization of themes in non-linear arrangement of bookshelves. We then designed navigation interfaces to help children search for books using smartwatches. An integration of RFID smart bookshelf for popular books (placed in thematic-random-order), and visualized browsing interfaces were designed for children. Digital wall screens in clustering (inspired) and categorization (discovering) representations developed to recommend books for children in different cognitive-development groups. For children learning library-use instruction in a virtual-world environment, we created a mixed-reality corridor, in which children were immersed in interactive games and learn what the classification numbers mean. The world children live in is a three-dimensional space. Children at the concrete operational stage of development are apt to use their experiences in this physical world to navigate virtual worlds. Researchers proposed and examined various spatial-metadata schemes for a mixed-reality environment designed for children to find books.

For the purpose of accessing data efficiently, we describe how to integrate a geometric index into the database, and how to perform the operations that are requested in a real-time trip through the virtual world.","1063-6382","0-8186-8289-2","10.1109/ICDE.1998.655818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=655818","","Virtual reality;Geographic Information Systems;Navigation;Object oriented databases;Spatial databases;Layout;Real time systems;Information systems;Virtual prototyping;Network servers","virtual reality","desktop virtual reality interface;geographic information system;navigational capability;large topographic scenes;visual realism;real-time navigation;real-time interaction;functionality;prototype system;ViRGIS;client-server system;local area network;wide area network;object-oriented database;data access;geometric index","","4","4","17","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With ENISI, immunologists and infectious disease experts can test and generate hypotheses for enteric disease pathology and propose interventions through experimental infection of an in silico gut. ENISI is an agent based simulator, in which individual cells move through the simulated tissues, and engage in context-dependent interactions with the other cells with which they are in contact. The scale of ENISI is unprecedented in this domain, with the ability to simulate 107 cells for 250 simulated days on 576 cores in one and a half hours, with the potential to scale to even larger hardware and problem sizes. In this paper we describe the ENISI simulator for modeling mucosal immune responses to gastrointestinal pathogens. We then demonstrate the utility of ENISI by recreating an experimental infection of a mouse with Helicobacter pylori 26695. The results identify specific processes by which bacterial virulence factors do and do not contribute to pathogenesis associated with H. pylori strain 26695. These modeling results inform general intervention strategies by indicating immunomodulatory mechanisms such as those used in inflammatory bowel disease may be more appropriate therapeutically than directly targeting specific microbial populations through vaccination or by using antimicrobials.","1530-2075","978-1-4673-0975-2","10.1109/IPDPS.2012.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6267823","Computational Immunology;Parallel Efficiency and Scalability;Agent Based Simulation;BioComputing","Immune system;Microorganisms;Automata;Mathematical model;Biological system modeling;Diseases;Scalability","biological tissues;cellular biophysics;digital simulation;diseases;medical computing;software agents;statistical testing","high-performance interaction-based simulation;gut immunopathologies;enteric immunity simulator;modeling system;inflammatory immune pathways;regulatory immune pathways;microbe-immune cell interactions;ENISI;immunologists;infectious disease;hypothesis testing;disease pathology;in silico gut infection;agent based simulator;tissues;context-dependent interactions;mucosal immune response modeling;gastrointestinal pathogens;Helicobacter pylori 26695;bacterial virulence factors;immunomodulatory mechanisms;inflammatory bowel disease;microbial populations","","11","","30","","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eye-trackers are being incorporated into head mounted displays (HMDs), and eye-gaze is being used for interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality. For some interaction methods, it is important to accurately measure the x-and y-direction of the eye-gaze and especially the focal depth information. Generally, eye tracking technology has a high accuracy in x-and y-directions, but not in depth. We used a binocular gaze tracker with two eye cameras, and the gaze vector was input to an MLP neural network for training and estimation. For the performance evaluation, data was obtained from 13 people gazing at fixed points at distances from 1m to 5m. The gaze classification into fixed distances produced an average classification error of nearly 10%, and an average error distance of 0.42m. This is sufficient for some Augmented Reality applications, but more research is needed to provide an estimate of a user's gaze moving in continuous space.","","978-1-5386-3091-4","10.1109/ISUVR.2017.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988648","Eye-gaze;3D gaze;Machine Learning;Augmented Reality;Head-mounted display","Three-dimensional displays;Meters;Cameras;Training;Error analysis;Resists;Calibration","augmented reality;cameras;gaze tracking;helmet mounted displays;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","gaze depth;head mounted eye-tracker;head mounted displays;virtual reality;augmented reality;focal depth information;eye tracking technology;binocular gaze tracker;eye cameras;gaze vector;MLP neural network;training;performance evaluation;gaze classification;fixed distances;fixed points;average classification error;gaze depth estimation;multilayer perceptron","","4","","23","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the amount of data grows too large, the display quickly becomes cluttered. Clustering items by spatial and semantic attributes can temporarily alleviate the issue, but is not effective against an increasing amount of data. We present an adaptive information density display for AR that balances the amount of presented information against the potential clutter created by placing items on the screen. We use hierarchical clustering to create a level-of-detail structure, in which nodes closer to the root encompass groups of items, while the leaf nodes contain single items. Our method selects items and groups from different levels of this hierarchy based on user-defined preferences and on the amount of visual clutter caused by placing these items. The number of presented items is adapted during user interaction to avoid clutter. We compare our interface to a conventional AR browser interface in a qualitative user study. Users clearly preferred our interface, because it provided a better overview of the data and allowed for easier comparison. In a second study, we evaluated the effect of different degrees of clustering on search and recall tasks. Users generally made fewer errors, when using our interface for a search task, which indicates that the reduced clutter allowed them to stay focused on finding the relevant items.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-0836-0","10.1109/VR.2016.7504691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7504691","","Clutter;Data visualization;Visualization;Browsers;Semantics;Electronic mail;Clustering algorithms","augmented reality;computer displays;online front-ends;pattern clustering;user interfaces","adaptive information density display;augmented reality displays;AR browsers;geo-referenced data;items clustering;spatial attributes;semantic attributes;hierarchical clustering;level-of-detail structure;leaf nodes;user-defined preferences;visual clutter;AR browser interface;search-recall tasks","","8","","24","","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this ongoing study, qualitative approaches such as participatory design philosophy were used in designing and developing an AR-Book for deaf students. Three deaf students and three teachers who taught the deaf students were involved in this study. Two main findings showed that the sign language marker should be avoided and meanwhile, for the 3D model marker, it can work with the 2D picture or text.

In principle, the vacuum tube is potentially capable of very precise mathematical simulation (virtual reality) if three basic conditions prevail. These are: (1) the devices are perfectly evacuated; (2) electrodes and waveguiding structures are perfectly conducting; and (3) electrons can be viewed as 'particles'. The compilation of a computer simulation package for electron beam tubes requires the solution of two distinct field problems. Firstly, a finite difference, or finite element, representation of the Laplace of Poisson equation in the collector or gun regions of the device is required together with the observance of Lorentz forces on the electrons if magnetic focussing fields are present. Secondly, gain or oscillation in a microwave tube occurs in the beam/circuit interaction region. The 'circuit' is generally a slow-wave structure which supports a guided electromagnetic wave. The field solution for such circuits involves the numerical evaluation of the Helmholtz equation together with appropriate boundary conditions. One of the main tasks in the computer simulation of such structures entails the development of algorithms which can flexibly accommodate a wide variety of geometrical shapes.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=263724","","","digital simulation;electronic engineering computing;engineering graphics;finite element analysis;vacuum tubes","vacuum tube oscillators;vacuum tube amplifiers;finite difference representation;finite element representation;Laplace equation;electron gas;vacuum devices;microwave frequencies;CAD;computer modelling;virtual reality;electrodes;waveguiding structures;computer simulation package;electron beam tubes;Poisson equation;collector;Lorentz forces;magnetic focussing fields;gain;beam/circuit interaction region;slow-wave structure;Helmholtz equation;boundary conditions;computer simulation;geometrical shapes","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The difficulties are heightened when considering a locomotion interface where a walker produces large wrenches and where one must simulates the tactile sensation of any virtual object, be it rigid or soft. A Cable-Driven Locomotion Interface (CDLI), embedded as a peripheral in a virtual environment, is thus designed to address some of the aforementioned issues, since the use of cables as a mechanical transmission is known to provide many advantages such as low inertia, high speed, high acceleration and large workspace, among others. A CDLI walker would then navigate in a virtual environment with the aid of two haptic platforms (one for each foot) that can be regarded as two independent parallel robots sharing a common workspace as well as constraints in six degrees of freedom (DOF). The architecture of the CDLI framework has two components: the virtual environment manager and the controller manager. The former contains the definition of the environment in which the user navigates, as expressed by a graphic rendering engine and a communication interface. The second component computes and controls the wrenches from two physical models to accurately simulate soft and rigid virtual objects, thereby allowing haptic simulation of virtual objects using hybrid admittance/impedance with multi-contact interactions.","2324-7355","978-1-4244-2005-6","10.1109/HAPTICS.2008.4479937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479937","CDLI;cable;wire;haptic;parallel;robot;locomotion;interface;virtual;environment;H.1.1 [Models and principles]: Systems and Information Theory??General systems theory;H.5.2 [Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI)]: User Interfaces??Haptic I/O","Haptic interfaces;Foot;Virtual environment;Mechanical cables;Navigation;Environmental management;Communication system control;Computational modeling;Acceleration;Parallel robots","haptic interfaces;legged locomotion;path planning;rendering (computer graphics)","multicontact interaction;haptic foot platform;cable-driven locomotion interface;tactile sensation;virtual environment;path planning;parallel robot;graphic rendering engine;communication interface","","11","","24","","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","computer aided instruction;computer animation;computer science education;solid modelling;student experiments;training;Turing machines;virtual reality","virtual experiments;virtual reality technology;introduction to computing;public course;student training;computer science;computational thinking;teaching contents;Turing machine;computer organization;3D modeling;animation;human-machine interaction;demonstration experiments;verification experiments;interaction experiments;software copyrights;teaching effectiveness;learning efficiency","","5","","10","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional paper tests and subjective assessments by the patient's relatives, this study adopts virtual reality(VR) technology to develop a novel diagnosis & assessment system, which uses head mounted display(HMD), game technology and sensors to generate an interactive and panoramic scenario-a virtual convenience store-for assessment of executive functions and memory. A variety of tasks of multi-layered difficulty-level hierarchy, such as memorizing a shopping list, looking for certain goods, and checking out, has been designed for customized and adaptive assessment, training, and treatment of MD. In the meantime, the study also records test-takers' performance data (including path and central-vision movement) in the process of all tasks for the development of a novel diagnosis & assessment method. Moreover, test-takers' technology acceptance is measured for assessing the elderly's subjective perception of new technology and discussing the topic of human-machine interaction.

Furthermore, we enhanced a precise finger tracking device with a direct pinch-detection mechanism to improve the robustness of grasp detection. Our results indicate that finger-based interaction is generally preferred if the functionality and ergonomics of manually manipulated virtual artifacts has to be assessed. However, controller-based interaction is often faster and more robust. In projection-based environments finger-based interaction almost reaches the task completion times and the subjective robustness of controller-based interaction if the grasping heuristics relies on our direct pinch detection.

The model doesn't use technologies like GPS. Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence but here, the anchors placed are pervasive and persistent across the indoor environment for smooth navigation. Once placed, these virtual anchors remain at their location and can be used at any time by any person registered on our app. This model can be extended for the general public in any indoor space and also can be enhanced by gamification for better user interaction and retention.

When potential danger is detected, the ARS alerts the driver by progressively indicating the time to collision to the lead vehicle as well as merging vehicles from side lanes by an AR display that overlaps with the lead or merging vehicles. We tested the ARS with younger (18-30) and older (65-75) drivers in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Results showed that the ARS could significantly reduce collisions caused by hazard events such as sudden slowing of the lead vehicle or merging of vehicles from sides lanes. Consistent with previous results, older drivers, despite age-related decline in cognitive and motor abilities, could leverage their driving experience to avoid forward collisions with the lead vehicle as much as younger drivers. However, older drivers were poorer in avoiding collisions caused by sudden merging events than younger drivers. The ARS was found to be most useful in helping older adults to avoid collision caused by sudden hazard events, especially with the presence of a distraction task. The ARS was also more effective for older than younger drivers to encourage a safe driving distance with the lead vehicle. Interestingly, there seemed to be differential effects of the ARS on the general driving behavior of younger and older drivers. While older drivers in general became more careful and safer in how they drive with the ARS, younger drivers seemed to rely on the ARS to alert them to potential hazard events without adopting safer driving behavior.","","978-1-4799-2869-9","10.1109/ISMAR.2013.6671764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671764","","Vehicles;Augmented reality;Merging;Hazards;Visualization;Accidents;Analysis of variance","accident prevention;augmented reality;human computer interaction;traffic engineering computing","in-car augmented reality system;younger driver;older driver;distraction task;high-fidelity driving simulator;hazard event;cognitive ability;motor ability;forward collision;driving behavior","","3","","30","","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By providing timely cutaneous stimuli through a wearable finger device, we can make an object feel softer or more slippery than it really is, and we can also create the illusion of encountering virtual bumps and holes. We evaluate the proposed approach carrying out three experiments with human subjects. Results confirm that we can increase the compliance of a tangible object by varying the pressure applied through a wearable device.

Conventional wisdom holds that data gloves need calibration in order to obtain accurate results. However, calibration is a time-consuming process, inherently user-specific, and its results are often not perfect. In contrast, the present study aims at evaluating recognition methods that do not require prior calibration of the data glove, by using raw sensor readings as input features and mapping them directly to different categories of hand shapes. An experiment was carried out, where test persons wearing a data glove had to grasp physical objects of different shapes corresponding to the various grasp types of the Schlesinger taxonomy. The collected data was analyzed with 28 classifiers including different types of neural networks, decision trees, Bayes nets, and lazy learners. Each classifier was analyzed in six different settings, representing various application scenarios with differing generalization demands. The results of this work are twofold: (1) We show that a reasonably well to highly reliable recognition of grasp types can be achieved - depending on whether or not the glove user is among those training the classifier - even with uncalibrated data gloves. (2) We identify the best performing classification methods for recognition of various grasp types. To conclude, cumbersome calibration processes before productive usage of data gloves can be spared in many situations.","2375-5334","1-4244-0905-5","10.1109/VR.2007.352459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161001","Data Glove;Calibration;Grasp Recognition;Classification Methods;I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and TechniquesÂ¿Interaction techniques;I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and RealismÂ¿[Virtual Reality]","Data gloves;Calibration;Shape;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Testing;Taxonomy;Data analysis;Classification tree analysis;Neural networks;Decision trees","calibration;data gloves;pattern classification;virtual prototyping;virtual reality","grasp recognition;uncalibrated data gloves;classification methods;object manipulation;Schlesinger taxonomy;cumbersome calibration","","31","","24","","23 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to resolve this problem, a general object terminal was designed, which combined real electrical signal with virtual 3D scene. The mechanical field and other unmanageable fields are transformed to electrical field through mathematical modeling and process channel techniques, which is easier to be controlled. The embedded system provides both electrical signals representing the input and output characteristics of a variety of general objects and 3D interaction to enhance the real experience for users. In the design and implementation of the object terminal, the real time performance, design ability and expansibility are fully considered. Furthermore, combined with the business service software on the server and the standard optional modules, the designed object terminal constructs a novel practical training and evaluation platform which complements virtuality with reality, and combines software with hardware.","","978-1-4799-5825-2","10.1109/WCICA.2014.7053722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053722","measure and control system;general object;embedded system;virtual reality","Three-dimensional displays;Graphics processing units;Field programmable gate arrays;Automation;Control systems;Training","control engineering computing;embedded systems;solid modelling;virtual reality","general object terminal design;measure & control systems;embedded platform;user experience;electrical signal;virtual 3D scene;mechanical field;unmanageable fields;electrical field;mathematical modeling;process channel techniques;3D interaction;real time performance;design ability;business service software;standard optional modules;object terminal;training platform;evaluation platform","","","","","","5 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The release of commercial VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) has been a major contributing factor. However, there is still much to be learned, especially how views and input techniques, as well as their interaction, affect the VR experience. There is little work done on First-Person Shooter (FPS) games in VR, and those few studies have focused on a single aspect of VR FPS. They either focused on the view, e.g., comparing VR to a typical 2D display or on the controller types. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating variations of 2D/3D views in HMDs, controller types, and their interactions. As such, it is challenging to distinguish findings related to the controller type from those related to the view. If a study does not control for the input method and finds that 2D displays lead to higher performance than VR, we cannot generalize the results because of the confounding variables. To understand their interaction, we propose to analyze in more depth, whether it is the view (2D vs. 3D) or the way it is controlled that gives the platforms their respective advantages. To study the effects of the 2D/3D views, we created a 2D visual technique, PlaneFrame, that was applied inside the VR headset. Our results show that the controller type can have a significant positive impact on performance, immersion, and simulator sickness when associated with a 2D view. They further our understanding of the interactions that controllers and views have and demonstrate that comparisons are highly dependent on how both factors go together. Further, through a series of three experiments, we developed a technique that can lead to a substantial performance, a good level of immersion, and can minimize the level of simulator sickness.","1554-7868","978-1-7281-8508-8","10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284718","Virtual Reality;2D/3D Views;Controller types;First Person Shooter;Gaming;Head-Mounted Displays","Performance evaluation;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Keyboards;Games;Turning","computer games;data visualisation;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","virtual reality;input techniques;VR experience;VR FPS;typical 2D display;controller type;2D visual technique;VR headset;first person shooter games;commercial VR head-mounted displays;2D-3D views;PlaneFrame","","","","54","","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We contribute to a growing body of work that explores this question and maps out simulated-versus-real differences, by explicitly investigating empathy: how people empathize with a physical or simulated robot when something bad happens to it. Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work. Empathy is particularly relevant to social HRI and is integral to, for example, companion and care robots. Our contribution additionally includes an original and reproducible HRI experimental design to induce empathy toward robots in laboratory settings, and an experimentally validated empathy-measuring instrument from psychology for use with HRI.

In this paper we introduce a seated VR exergame for fall prevention of older adults. The game has been designed and developed together with clinical experts and therapists to provide adequate fall prevention exercises, which can be implemented in patients daily schedules and administered through a VR exergame.

It is being used to explore consistency and trust in the use of robots as social mediums, where robots serve as intermediaries between dependents (e.g., trapped survivors) and the outside world (doctors, rescuers, family members). While the SciGirl experimentation was neither statistically significant nor rigorously controlled, the experience makes three contributions. It introduces the Survivor Buddy project and social medium role, it illustrates that human-robot interaction is an appealing way to make robotics more accessible to the general public, and raises interesting questions about the existence of a minimum set of degrees of freedom for sufficient expressiveness, the relative importance of voice versus non-verbal affect, and the range and intensity of robot motions.","2167-2148","978-1-4244-4892-0","10.1109/HRI.2010.5453233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453233","assistive robots;human-robot interaction;gaze and gestures;interaction styles;robots;user interfaces","Human robot interaction;Cognitive robotics;TV;Computer science;Broadcasting;MIMO;Monitoring;Robot motion;User interfaces;Testing","human-robot interaction;user interfaces","SciGirls;survivor buddy human-robot interaction;middle-school girls;Public Broadcast System science reality show;freedom robot head;MIMO;multimedia touch screen monitor;social medium role;robotics","","","","11","","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These principles seek to contribute to developing a specific visual grammar, which is essential if Augmented Reality is to go beyond technological performance to acquire the status of a true media, like all other vision-based media. This visual grammar constitutes a reference based on which designers may then build projects whose narrative and/or emotional content captivates the end-user. The research presented starts from an artistic approach through design and derives generic principles. The starting point is the development of actual AR installations and their presentation to the general public in the form of an evolving exhibition entitled Give Me More. Following two initial presentations in Lausanne and San Francisco, Give Me More was the winner of the DMY International Design Festival Berlin 2010. The designers' work relies on the software and research of the EPFL Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab) and Dr Julien Pilet. The results have made it possible to define certain rules for visual links between the physical and virtual worlds, simple narrative principles for the animations and a global approach for the design of representation devices. The results also show that there is much work yet to be done in order to devise an initial global visual grammar for Augmented Reality - an absolute prerequisite to turn this into a fully-fledged media.","2381-8360","978-1-4673-0059-9","10.1109/ISMAR-AMH.2011.6093661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093661","Art;augmented reality;computer vision;interaction design;image recognition;media design;object recognition;perception;pervasive computing","Augmented reality;Visualization;Animation;Media;Computer vision;Art;Lighting","augmented reality;computer animation;computer vision;grammars;human computer interaction;multimedia computing;visual languages","augmented reality;design exploration;dedicated visual language;EPFL+ECAL Lab;visual principles;visual grammar;vision-based media;generic principles;Give Me More;DMY International Design Festival Berlin 2010;EPFL Computer Vision Laboratory;Dr Julien Pilet;CVLab","","1","","16","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the proposed technique yields accurate and stable estimates of the 3D position of the user's eyes, while the user moves in front of the stereoscopic display. The correct tracking of both eyes' 3D position is a crucial step in order to achieve a more natural human-computer interaction which diminishes visual fatigue. The proposed approach is validated through quantitative tests: (i) we assessed the accuracy of our algorithm for tracking the 3D position of users' eyes with and without stereo glasses; (ii) we have performed a perceptual assessment of the natural interaction in the virtual environments through experimental sessions with several users.","2379-1780","978-1-4799-8023-9","10.1109/IC3D.2014.7032592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032592","Human-computer interactions;Virtual reality;Augmented reality;stereoscopic 3D entertainment system;computer vision","Face;Glass;Three-dimensional displays;Stereo image processing;Virtual reality;Solid modeling;Tracking","computer graphics;face recognition;human computer interaction;image colour analysis;stereo image processing","3D position detection;consumer RGB-D camera;stereoscopic mixed reality environments;users eyes 3D position tracking;stereoscopic virtual environments;stereo glasses;face tracking algorithm;occlusion;biometric features;motion tracking techniques;stereoscopic display;human computer interaction;visual fatigue","","","","13","","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of the discussed approach will provide the possibility of automatic adjustment (based on the technology of the Internet of Things) of augmented reality elements in abstract visual objects of art, with a view to a deeper understanding of their audience.","","978-1-7281-4069-8","10.1109/IDAACS.2019.8924411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8924411","augmented reality;verbal semantic differential method;abstract paintings;semantic similarity analysis;scenarios approach","Semantics;Visualization;Art;Augmented reality;Internet of Things;Painting;Information systems","art;augmented reality;data visualisation;Internet of Things","abstract paintings;semantic similarity analysis;abstract visual objects;modern art;generalized scenario;lexico-semantic analysis;visitors verbal assessments;quantitative assessment;semantic proximity verbal assessments;visual object;augmented reality elements","","","","10","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present the TanGi toolkit which enables novices to rapidly build physical proxy objects using Composable Shape Primitives. TanGi also provides Manipulators allowing users to build objects including movable parts, making them suitable for rich object exploration and manipulation in VR. With a set of different use cases and applications we show the capabilities of the TanGi toolkit and evaluate its use. In a study with 16 participants, we demonstrate that novices can quickly build physical proxy objects using the Composable Shape Primitives and explore how different levels of object embodiment affect virtual object exploration. In a second study with 12 participants we evaluate TanGi's Manipulators and investigate the effectiveness of embodied interaction. Findings from this study show that TanGi's proxies outperform traditional controllers and were generally favored by participants.","1554-7868","978-1-7281-8508-8","10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284771","Virtual Reality;Tangible Interfaces;VR Object Exploration and Manipulation;Tangible Proxy Objects","Shape;Manipulators;Augmented reality","manipulators;virtual reality","complex virtual objects;free-hand interaction techniques;TanGi toolkit;physical proxy objects;object exploration;object embodiment;manipulators;virtual reality;composable shape primitives","","","","66","","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the proposal of interaction metaphors applied to 3D environments which aim at replicating real world concepts into the virtual environment, facilitates user's interaction. The utilization of gestural interaction metaphors within a 3D environment can turn the user experience more familiar and concrete, making the training curb smaller. However, in order to apply interaction metaphors it is necessary their classification and generalization, so that they can be widely deployed in different applications. This paper introduces the development of a generic and customizable solution for the mediation of user gestural interaction (selection, manipulation and navigation) with heterogeneous rendering engines for virtual reality environments. This solution, called Gesture3DFramework, allows the users context and gesture-metaphors configuration to be easily customized so that it can be adaptable to multiple 3D virtual environments. With Gesture3DFramework, the final user (and developer) will be provided with a higher level of abstraction when it comes to the development of interactive virtual reality applications, since once the configuration directives have been described, the system will adapt itself to the specific interaction routines of the applied rendering engine.","","978-1-7281-0437-9","10.1109/CLEI.2018.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8786315","Virtual Reality;Gesture Interaction;Selection;Manipulation;Navigation;Immersion;3D environment","Three-dimensional displays;Casting;Navigation;Middleware;Virtual environments;Rendering (computer graphics)","gesture recognition;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;middleware;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","generic gesture-based interaction middleware;user experience;user gestural interaction;multiple 3D virtual environments;interactive virtual reality applications;Gesture3DFramework;rendering engine;interaction routines","","","","","","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

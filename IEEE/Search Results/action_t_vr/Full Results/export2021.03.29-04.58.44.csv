This can be achieved through an appropriate anti-roll moment distribution between the front and rear axles of a vehicle with controllable suspension actuators. Such control action alters the load transfer distribution, which in turn provokes a lateral tire force variation. With respect to the extensive set of papers from the literature discussing yaw rate tracking through active suspension control, this study presents: i) A detailed analysis of the effect of the load transfer on the lateral axle force and cornering stiffness; ii) A novel linearized single-track vehicle model formulation for control system design, based on the results in i); and iii) An optimization-based routine for the design of the non-linear feedforward contribution of the control action. The resulting feedforward-feedback controller is assessed through: a) Simulations with an experimentally validated model of a vehicle with active anti-roll bars (case study 1); and b) Experimental tests on a vehicle prototype with an active suspension system (case study 2).","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2955902","European Union through the Horizon 2020 Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8915752","Anti-roll moment distribution control;load transfer;linearized model;quasi-static model;yaw rate control;feedforward;feedback","Axles;Force;Tires;Load modeling;Suspensions;Control systems;Feedforward systems","actuators;axles;control system synthesis;feedback;feedforward;road vehicles;steering systems;suspensions (mechanical components);tyres;vehicle dynamics","yaw rate control;vehicle dynamics;cornering response;transient conditions;rear axles;controllable suspension actuators;control action;load transfer distribution;lateral tire force variation;yaw rate tracking;active suspension control;lateral axle force;stiffness;single-track vehicle model formulation;control system design;feedforward-feedback controller;vehicle prototype;active suspension system;active antiroll bars;antiroll moment distribution;variable front-to-total antiroll moment distribution","","","","54","CCBY","27 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Field effects of frequencies up to 1 kHz and above 1 MHz are well known. The intermediate frequency range lacks intensive research. Only little attention has been paid so far. Yet due to recent innovations in medical diagnostics and therapies like Magnetic Particle Imaging or RF-Hyperthermia, the need arises to investigate the frequency range from 1kHz to 1 MHz. This work presents results of numerical field calculations of a human body model placed within simple coil configurations. Induced current densities, generated by alternating coil currents, are simulated. The effect of current densities are demonstrated and evaluated on schematic cell models of excitable tissue. In order to generate an action potential at the cell membrane, a difference in electric potential from intra- to extracellular space must be present. It can be shown that in case of sufficient field strength, stimulation of nerves and muscles is possible up to a frequency of 100 kHz. The aim of this paper is to transfer simulation results from the macroscopic model to the microscopic model in order to estimate field effects of big field generating coils.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5625970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625970","","Current density;Numerical models;Muscles;Computational modeling;Magnetic tunneling;Biomembranes;Coils","bioelectric potentials;biological effects of fields;biomagnetism;biomembrane transport;cellular biophysics;coils;current density;neurophysiology;physiological models","time-varying magnetic fields;numerical field calculations;human body model;alternating coil currents;current densities;schematic cell models;cell membrane;extracellular space;electric potential;intracellular space;eddy currents;conductive tissues;nerves;muscles;biological tissue;frequency 1 kHz to 1 MHz","Electromagnetic Fields;Human Body;Humans;Whole Body Imaging","2","","7","","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development of a SCB has traditionally been guided by an experimental approach. Experiments conducted worldwide show that the melting and vaporization of a SCB when heated by an electrical current is a very complex physical process. In this process, the bridge goes through multi-phase changes, i.e., in order solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma-state. This paper discusses the numerical simulation of the SCB working process when driven with a short low-energy pulse. In an effort to elucidate the behaviors of the SCB working process, the temperature distribution before the SCB melting and SCB discharge are presented. The basic semiconductor equations and heat transfer equation are described to evaluate the temperature distribution in the SCB. The results are obtained from finite-difference implementations. The edge gasification effect of SCB is proved by the curve of temperature distribution, and the double temperature characteristic of SCB is shown. Finally, a SCB discharge model is established. The result shows that the bigger the external voltage, the longer is the discharge time.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2011.2173504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6094225","Arc discharge;mechanism of function;semiconductor bridge (SCB);temperature distribution","Mathematical model;Discharges;Equations;Temperature distribution;Charge carrier processes;Plasma temperature","heat transfer;heat treatment;melting;modelling;numerical analysis;reliability;semiconductor devices;temperature distribution;vaporisation","semiconductor bridge;discharge modeling;explosive initiator;ignition consistency;reliability;melting;vaporization;electrical current;multiphase change;numerical simulation;low-energy pulse;heat transfer equation;semiconductor equation;edge gasification effect;temperature distribution","","4","","17","","2 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such control laws are applied to systems that repeat the same operation, known as trials, over a finite duration. The underlying approach is to specify a reference trajectory and using the recorded data from the previous trials to update the control input signal such that the sequence of trial outputs converge to this specified trajectory. For linear time-invariant dynamics, successful design requires that the first Markov parameter is non-zero, i.e., the system transfer-function is proper. The new design in this paper allows direct treatment of strictly proper dynamics by use of anticipative action based on previous trial data and the resulting design computations are linear matrix inequality based. A simulation case study based on robotic manipulator dynamics, whose model was developed from experimentally measured data, is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new design procedure.","","978-1-4799-7886-1","10.1109/CDC.2015.7403176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403176","","Process control;Convergence;Symmetric matrices;Markov processes;Linear matrix inequalities;Service robots","control system synthesis;convergence;iterative learning control;linear matrix inequalities;linear systems;manipulator dynamics;Markov processes;transfer functions","iterative learning control design;zero Markov parameter system;repetitive process setting;error convergence;transient dynamics regulation;reference trajectory;control input signal;linear time-invariant dynamics;system transfer-function;anticipative action;linear matrix inequality;robotic manipulator dynamics","","1","","16","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is achieved by inverting the voltage potential across the piezoelectric element and thereby maintaining a higher voltage while extracting energy. The increased potential allows vibration harvesters to operate over a broader frequency range. For weakly coupled piezoelectric harvesters, the increased potential allows the electrical power output to be increased. In this paper, the circuit is simulated in SPICE using existing models of discrete components in conjunction with a model of a piezoelectric vibration harvester. The power output and mechanical behavior of the harvester using the presented circuit are compared to two existing technologies: Synchronous Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) and a full-wave rectifying bridge. The comparison demonstrates that the novel Interleaved Switch Harvesting on Inductor (ISHI) circuit outperforms state-of-the-art active harvesting solutions, e.g., SSHI, as a result of the decreased energy losses from diodes. In addition, the ISHI circuit requires fewer components than does the SSHI circuit and solves the floating transistor source issue that arises in SSHI implementations. To achieve the maximum power conversion efficiency, impedance matching is required, which can be achieved by controlling the voltage of the storage device.","","978-1-4673-9220-4","10.1109/I2MTC.2016.7520439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7520439","","Transistors;Piezoelectric materials;Vibrations;Damping;Strain;Capacitance;Switching circuits","diodes;energy harvesting;impedance matching;inductors;piezoelectric transducers;rectifying circuits;switches;transistors","ISHI circuit;floating transistor source;maximum power conversion efficiency;impedance matching;full-wave rectifying bridge;SSHI circuit;synchronous switch harvesting on inductor circuit;discrete component model;SPICE simulation;weakly coupled piezoelectric vibration harvester;energy extraction;voltage potential inversion;simplified active control circuitry;storage device;piezoelectric element;electric charge;nonlinear extraction;interleaved switch harvesting on inductor circuit","","","","18","","25 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The presence of non-linear loads (high-bandwidth controlled converters, CPLs) may cause dangerous voltage oscillations or even instability in presence of small or large disturbances (e.g. connection/disconnection of loads). To face this important issue, the voltage actuator approach appears as an effective solution by using DC/DC converters as sources of stabilizing power. Such controlling action is obtained by imposing control signals determined by different techniques. In this regard, the main goal of this paper is to analyze the action of three control techniques (State Feedback, Active Damping and Linearization via State Feedback) in order to suggest the implementation considering the system criticality (e.g. the CPL power or the filter damping factor). Numerical simulations are useful to compare the proposed methods by observing the control action in presence of growing disturbances.","","978-8-8872-3723-8","10.1109/AEIT.2014.7002058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002058","","Voltage control;Power system stability;Transient analysis;Stability analysis;Mathematical model;Damping;State feedback","DC-DC power convertors;linearisation techniques;marine power systems;state feedback;voltage control","voltage control solutions;CPL instability;MVDC shipboard power systems;medium voltage DC power systems;voltage oscillations;voltage actuator;DC/DC converters;state feedback control technique;active damping control technique;linearization control technique","","16","","9","","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding operational risks and providing prompt control actions are of great importance to ensure secure and economic operation of a bulk power system. In this paper, a novel integrated online dynamic security assessment system (DSAS) is developed that intakes real-time EMS snapshots combining both bus/branch and node/breaker network models, performs dynamic contingency analysis under various conditions, calculates real-time transfer limits, and provides online control suggestions to mitigate operational risks. Several unique and innovative features are developed to address practical challenges, including: (1) real-time stitching of power flow information from both node/breaker and bus/branch models covering different geographical regions of interest; (2) online corrections and enhancements to power flow and dynamic models; (3) equipment-name-based modelling approaches for complex contingencies and control systems; and (5) distributed computing capabilities for significant computational speed enhancement.

The current practice is that many models are developed from scratch, while they could have been built by reusing existing models. Moreover, when models need reconfiguration, they often need to be rebuilt significantly. These problems reduce the development efficiency and ultimately damage the efficacy of ABM. This paper partially resolves the challenges of model reusability from the systems engineering approach. Specifically, we propose a formalism-based ABM development and demonstrate its potential to promote model reuses. Our formalism, named large-scale, dynamic, extensible, and flexible (LDEF) formalism, encourages the building of a larger model by the composition of modularly developed components. Also, LDEF is tailored to the ABM contexts to represent the agent's action procedure and support the dynamic changes of their interactions. This paper shows that LDEF improves the model reusability in ABM development through its practical examples and theoretical discussions.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2461178","Man-Made Disaster Prevention Research Center, National Emergency Management Agency of Korea “Research and Development of Modeling and Simulating the Rescues, the Transfer, and the Treatment of Disaster Victims”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192627","Agent-based model (ABM) formalism;efficient ABM development;formalism-based model development;model reusability;Agent-based model (ABM) formalism;efficient ABM development;formalism-based model development;model reusability","Context;Couplings;Context modeling;Artificial intelligence;Biological system modeling","software agents;software reusability;systems engineering","LDEF formalism;agent-based model development;model reconfiguration;model reusability;systems engineering;formalism-based ABM development;large-scale dynamic extensible and flexible formalism;agent action procedure","","6","","60","","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Power spectral density (PSD) of any EMG signal plays a vital role to determine the signal strength. A novel Simulink model has been developed which mimics various elements of an active SEMG sensor. By using this model, low/high/notch filters are designed and optimized. The model is also used to simulate the effects of these filters on power spectral density (PSD) of the EMG signal. Simulation of double rectification and smoothing (envelopment) is also carried out.

The heating can be delivered using electromagnetic (EM) energy, mostly in the radiofrequency (RF) or microwave range. Accurate patient-specific hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) is essential for effective and safe treatments, in particular, for deep and loco-regional hyperthermia. An important aspect of HTP is the ability to focus microwave energy into the tumor and reduce the occurrence of hot spots in healthy tissue. This paper presents a method for optimizing the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution for the head and neck cancer hyperthermia treatment. The SAR quantifies the rate at which localized RF or microwave energy is absorbed by the biological tissue when exposed to an EM field. A differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm is proposed in order to improve the SAR coverage of the target region. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by testing with the Erasmus MC patient dataset. DE is compared to the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, in terms of average performance and standard deviation and across various clinical metrics, such as the hot-spot-tumor SAR quotient (HTQ), treatment quantifiers, and temperature parameters. While hot spots in the SAR distribution remain a problem with current approaches, DE enhances focusing microwave energy absorption to the target region during hyperthermia treatment. In particular, DE offers improved performance compared to the PSO algorithm currently deployed in the clinic, reporting a range of improvement of HTQ standard deviation of between 40.1-96.8% across six patients.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2627941","NUI Galway BMERM; Science Foundation Ireland; MiMED COST Action; Dutch Cancer Society; Technology Foundation STW; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7742912","Differential evolution (DE) algorithm;hyperthermia;hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP);specific absorption rate (SAR)","Hyperthermia;Optimization;Tumors;Antennas;Cancer;Electromagnetic heating;Linear programming","biological effects of microwaves;cancer;hyperthermia;particle swarm optimisation;radiation therapy;tumours","SAR distribution;head and neck hyperthermia;cancer treatment modality;malignant tumor;electromagnetic energy;radiofrequency range;microwave range;patient-specific HTP;hyperthermia treatment planning;locoregional hyperthermia;specific absorption rate;cancer hyperthermia treatment;biological tissue;differential evolution optimization algorithm;particle swarm optimization;PSO method;hot-spot-tumor SAR quotient;treatment quantifier;temperature parameters;microwave energy absorption","Absorption, Radiation;Body Temperature;Computer Simulation;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Energy Transfer;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Humans;Hyperthermia, Induced;Microwaves;Models, Biological;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Thermal Conductivity;Treatment Outcome","4","","41","","14 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A preliminary analysis shows that the frequency responses from the actuators to the microphones are characterized by a very large band and exhibit a high modal density with many resonance peaks. Based on these facts, the design of a feedback control law could originate spillover phenomena, which will manifest through the generation of high frequency sounds even more unpleasent than the original noise. Therefore we propose the design of a controller based on an open loop control philosophy; that is the control action is designed in such a way that the spectrum of the control signals is contained into the disturbance band. Since the noise we deal with is not of a classical type (pure sinusoidal or multi-tonal) but is a wide band disturbance, classical open loop control techniques, based on model inversion, cannot be implemented; to this end the concept of Generalized Frequency Response, which allows us to deal with wide band signals, is introduced in the paper.

Vlkolinský",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Journal of Radiation Research","18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i22","i23","Overview: The five-university NSCOR project investigates the responses of the central nervous system to space-like charged particle exposure by evaluating: synaptic function, in vitro and in vivo neurogenesis, behavior and behaviorally induced gene expression, and oxidative stress of the mouse hippocampus and cultured neural precursor cells. To test the role of reactive oxygen species in mediating the effects of radiation exposure, we compare responses in a catalase overexpressing transgenic mouse strain to wild type. We also use computational models of the hippocampus in three dimensions, informed by experimental measurements, to provide insight into network behavior.Radiation exposure protocols include single, acute whole-body exposures to 1H, 28Si and 56Fe ions and mixed field exposures using 1H + 56Fe ions (24 h later). The animal models are 10-week-old C57BL/6J and MCATtg males which are evaluated at 30 and 90 days postirradiation. In vitro models are cultured murine and human neural stem cells irradiated with 1H, 16O, 28Si and 56Fe ions at multiple energies and are evaluated at times from days to weeks.Highlights: Neural stem cells organized into neurospheres were irradiated with several ions at doses as low as 0.75 cGy. Data show that significant oxidative stress occurs that alters survival, proliferation and differentiation. Overall trends indicate that changes in oxidative stress (persisting for weeks) correlate with particle linear energy transfer (LET). 56Fe ions elicited the largest and most persistent changes in stress markers, including antioxidant enzyme expression levels.The hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and novel object recognition (NOR) paradigms were used to assess cognition and showed cognitive deficits after irradiation with the NOR paradigm more sensitive than CFC. Analysis of neurogenesis indicates that overall neurogenesis is inhibited at doses ≥1 Gy, but newly born activated microglia are significantly elevated at ≥0.1 Gy. High LET radiation affects all lineages of neural precursor cells and elicits a U-shaped dose–response for cells exhibiting the astrocyte marker GFAP. In a mixed field irradiation regimen (0.1 Gy 1H, then 0.5 Gy 56Fe 24 h later), NOR was impaired with 0.1 Gy 1H or 0.1 Gy 1H + 0.5 Gy 56Fe but not with 0.5 Gy 56Fe alone. A negative correlation between newly born activated microglia and NOR or behaviorally activated Arc gene expression was observed for exposures using protons and iron ions, suggesting that neuroinflammation contributes to the cognitive injury. A set of monocyte chemoattractant chemokines was reduced after the mixed beam exposure but not after the individual exposures suggesting compensatory or adaptive responses are elicited by the proton exposure.Patch clamp recordings on principal neurons of the CA1 and DG hippocampus fields were conducted on mice irradiated with 1H, 28Si and 56Fe iron ions. Input resistance and resting membrane potential were modified by irradiation in CA1 and protons were found to be the most effective ion species. These parameters suggest that more miniature excitatory post synaptic potentials must be elicited simultaneously to initiate action potentials and therefore the neurons are less responsive post irradiation. Si- and Fe-irradiated animals showed only minor alterations in mEPSCs and mIPSCs. Granule neurons of the DG field showed no differences after 28Si irradiation, but with 56Fe significant increases in AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC frequency were observed without affecting amplitude. This focuses attention on presynaptic glutamate release mechanisms.Functional changes in the CA1 network triggered by whole-body irradiation with protons, iron and silicon radiation were assessed with microelectrode array field recordings. Deficits in input–output curves and long-term potentiation (LTP) are observed in proton irradiated mice. In the dentate gyrus field, radiation enhanced input–output curves and LTP which is opposite of the inhibition observed for the CA1 field. This suggests that in the DG the most sensitive targets may be GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons that regulate granular cell excitability. 28Si ion effects appear to be associated with dendro-somatic coupling expected to affect signaling of the hippocampal neurons to other brain structures and vary between rostral and ventral hippocampal regions. Observations on MCATtg mice show attenuation of radiation-elicited responses, which implicates reactive oxygen species as mediators of the biological responses.Modeling activities using a high-fidelity three-dimensional model of the hippocampus have begun and allow simulation of network activities incorporating neuron structural and functional parameters measured experimentally to probe their individual and combined contributions to network behavior. Changes in firing statistics are observed after incorporating measured electrophysiological parameters into the model.Clinical trial registration number: not applicable.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206925","Brain;High LET radiation;Electrophysiology;Behavior;Neurogenesis","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The converter consists of a single string of cascaded voltage source submodules (VSMs) and a current source submodule (CSM) of current doubler type. The converter is based on a recently proposed energy transfer mechanism whereby the CSM of the converter directs its current, through control action, to either the positive or negative terminal of the DC grid. Therefore, the CSM provides ""shaping"" of the current of the string. Due to the current doubling action by the CSM, the string current has an amplitude equal to approximately 1/2 the DC load current. This topology therefore offers improved current utilization of the VSMs as well as reduced VSM cell capacitances compared to that of the previously proposed topology based on this energy transfer mechanism. In this paper, the structure and operating principles of the converter are presented along with a steady-state circuit analysis.

Without proper remedial actions, these oscillations can result in power systems separation or major blackouts. Adequate damping of these oscillations is a pre-requisite for secure operation of power systems. An available solution to damp out these inter-area oscillations is the addition of power system stabilizers (PSSs) to the excitation systems of the generators. Although conventional PSSs exist on many generators, their effect is only on the damping of local oscillations and do not effectively damp out inter-area oscillations. In this paper a robust PSS based on PMU signals is proposed to ensure satisfactory damping of inter-area oscillations which result in enhancing system stability and maximizing power transfer capacity. The signal input to the proposed PSSs are detected and transmitted by the PMUs. Modal analysis and time-domain transient simulation results show that inter-area oscillation damping was improved effectively with the proposed PSSs.","","978-1-4799-7949-3","10.1109/PECI.2015.7064889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064889","Phasor Measurement Units;Inter-Area Oscillations;Power System Stabilizers;Real-Time System Modeling;Transient Stability;Modal Analysis","Oscillators;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Damping;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Generators;Time-domain analysis","modal analysis;oscillations;power system interconnection;power system stability;time-domain analysis","PSS design;PMU signals;interconnected power system;interarea oscillations;power system stabilizers;power transfer capacity;modal analysis;time-domain transient simulation;interarea oscillation","","3","","9","","23 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) operation of a spark ignition (SI) engine is modeled by using such a complex nonlinear discrete-time system. A dual-controller approach is undertaken where primary adaptive critic NN controller is designed for the nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system whereas the secondary one for the affine nonlinear discrete-time system but the controllers together offer the desired performance. The primary adaptive critic NN controller includes an NN observer for estimating the states and output, an NN critic, and two action NNs for generating virtual control and actual control inputs for the nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system, whereas an additional critic NN and an action NN are included for the affine nonlinear discrete-time system by assuming the state availability. All NN weights adapt online towards minimization of a certain performance index, utilizing gradient-descent-based rule. Using Lyapunov theory, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error, weight estimates, and observer estimates are shown. The adaptive critic NN controller performance is evaluated on an SI engine operating with high EGR levels where the controller objective is to reduce cyclic dispersion in heat release while minimizing fuel intake. Simulation and experimental results indicate that engine out emissions drop significantly at 20% EGR due to reduction in dispersion in heat release thus verifying the dual-control approach.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2008.2000452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4560233","Adaptive critic design;near-optimal control;nonstrict feedback nonlinear discrete-time system;output feedback control;separation principle","Sparks;Engines;Neural networks;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Neurofeedback;Observers;Temperature control","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;discrete time systems;feedback;internal combustion engines;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems","reinforcement-learning;dual-control methodology;complex nonlinear discrete-time systems;spark engine EGR operation;adaptive neural network controller;complex feedback nonlinear discrete-time systems;exhaust gas recirculation;spark ignition engine;virtual control;nonstrict feedback;state availability;performance index;gradient-descent-based rule;Lyapunov theory;uniformly ultimate boundedness;closed-loop tracking error;cyclic dispersion","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automobiles;Computer Simulation;Energy Transfer;Gases;Hot Temperature;Models, Theoretical;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated","19","","23","","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than presuming that patients could generalize in three conditions, this study tested whether there was any evidence of such generalization ability in healthy individuals.

The array is used to measure deformation of the esophageal conduit wall and the interaction between food bolus and the esophagus in the form of pressure and shear stress, which is a novel in vitro method of food bolus transport study. It is constructed from a thin sheet of copper-polyimide laminate via a cost effective fabrication process involving photolithography, wet etching, and laser engraving technique. Calibration is conducted individually on the pressure, shear, and strain sensor elements of the array. The pressure, shear, and strain sensors response exhibit an average hysteresis of 10.17%, 11.78%, and 26.37% caused by the soft silicon rubber encapsulation. Linear regression technique is used to determine the linear sensitivity transfer function for all the three sensors. The array is embedded beneath the surface of the esophageal conduit of the swallowing robot and a series of swallowing experiments are conducted. Three types of food bolus with a viscosity of 0.18, 0.62, and 1.55 Pa · s are prepared using a commercial food thickener. The swallowing robot generates a peristaltic wave of 60-mm wavefront length and 40-mm·s-1 wave speed to mimic the swallowing action seen in the human esophagus. Manometer measurements are taken alongside for validation. The pressure sensor records maximum pressures of 2.24, 3.17, and 7.74 kPa, respectively, for the three types of bolus during swallowing.

We investigate the morphology of gaseous flows on the basis of three-dimensional gas-dynamical calculations of interacting binaries of different types (cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries).We find that taking into account a circumbinary envelope leads to significant changes in the stream-disc morphology. In particular, the obtained steady-state self-consistent solutions show an absence of impact between the gas stream from the inner Lagrangian point L1 and the forming accretion disc. The stream deviates under the action of the gas of the circumbinary envelope, and does not cause the shock perturbation of the disc boundary (traditional hotspot). At the same time, the gas of the circumbinary envelope interacts with the stream and causes the formation of an extended shock wave, located on the stream edge. We discuss the implication of this model without hotspot (but with a shock wave located outside the disc) for interpretation of the observations. The comparison of synthetic light curves with observations proves the validity of the discussed gas-dynamical model without hotspot.We have also considered the influence of the circumbinary envelope on the mass transfer rate in semidetached binaries. The obtained features of flow structure in the vicinity of L1 show that the gas of the circumbinary envelope plays an important role in the flow dynamics, and that it leads to significant (in order of magnitude) increase of the mass transfer rate. The most important contribution to this increase is from the stripping of the mass-losing star atmosphere by interstellar gas flows.The parameters of the formed accretion disc are also given in the paper. We discuss the details of the obtained gaseous flow structure for different boundary conditions on the surface of mass-losing star, and show that the main features of this structure in semidetached binaries are the same for different cases.The comparison of gaseous flow structure obtained in two- and three-dimensional approaches is presented.

The input matching network and the output load of a rectifier circuit are simultaneously optimized using harmonic balance in order to maximize its RF-dc conversion efficiency. This paper focuses on identifying the optimum load value, which corresponds to maximum efficiency for different types of input signals. The efficiency curves versus the load value show a single optimum efficiency point, which is a different for signals with a time-varying envelope and continuous wave (CW) signals. Specifically, for the series diode rectifier that was considered, the optimal load shifts to larger values as the signal peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) increases compared to a CW signal with the same average power. As a result, for certain load values a signal with a time-varying envelope can result in a larger efficiency value than a CW signal. The peak efficiency value does not necessarily improve by using a signal with a time-varying envelope. A UHF rectifier prototype is built and its performance is evaluated experimentally showing good agreement with simulation.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2016.2561923","EU H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement; Generalitat de Catalunya; EU COST Action IC1301 Wireless Power Transmission for Sustainable Electronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470500","Harmonic balance;multi-tone;optimization;rectifier;RF-dc conversion efficiency;wireless power transfer.;Harmonic balance;multi-tone;optimization;rectifier;RF–dc conversion efficiency;wireless power transfer","Schottky diodes;Harmonic analysis;Resistance;Load modeling;Radio frequency;Capacitance;Peak to average power ratio","energy harvesting;radiofrequency power transmission;rectifying circuits","digitally modulated signals;multitone signals;RF energy-harvesting circuit;time-varying envelope;random modulation;input matching network;rectifier circuit;harmonic balance;RF-dc conversion efficiency;optimum load value identification;continuous wave signals;CW signals;series diode rectifier;peak-to-average-power-ratio;PAPR","","42","","30","","17 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose an apprenticeship learning approach to achieving context-aware action generalization on the task of robot-to-human object hand-over. The procedure combines learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning: a robot first imitates a demonstrator's execution of the task and then learns contextualized variants of the demonstrated action through experience. We use dynamic movement primitives as compact motion representations, and a model-based C-REPS algorithm for learning policies that can specify hand-over position, conditioned on context variables. Policies are learned using simulated task executions, before transferring them to the robot and evaluating emergent behaviours. We additionally conduct a user study involving participants assuming different postures and receiving an object from a robot, which executes hand-overs by either imitating a demonstrated motion, or adapting its motion to hand-over positions suggested by the learned policy. The results confirm the hypothesized improvements in the robot's perceived behaviour when it is context-aware and adaptive, and provide useful insights that can inform future developments.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197476","","Robots;Task analysis;Trajectory;Context modeling;Encoding;Adaptation models;Learning (artificial intelligence)","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);service robots;ubiquitous computing","demonstrated motion;learned policy;perceived behaviour;context-aware task execution;apprenticeship learning;assistive service robots;human-oriented tasks;task parameters;optimal behaviour;robot-to-human object hand-over;reinforcement learning;demonstrator;contextualized variants;demonstrated action;dynamic movement primitives;compact motion representations;model-based C-REPS algorithm;hand-over position;context variables;simulated task executions;evaluating emergent behaviours;context-aware action generalization","","","","35","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being able to exploit the knowledge acquired during a first learning phase may be critical in order to solve more complex tasks. This is the transfer learning problem. This problem is addressed here in the case of direct policy search algorithms. No discrete states, nor actions are defined a priori. A policy is described by a controller that computes orders to be sent to the motors out of sensor values. Both motor and sensor values can be continuous. The proposed approach relies on population based direct policy search algorithms, i.e. evolutionary algorithms. It exploits the numerous behaviors that are generated during the search. When learning on the source task, a knowledge base is built. The knowledge base aims at identifying the most salient behaviors segments with regards to the considered task. Afterwards, the knowledge base is exploited on a target task, with a reward shaping approach: besides its reward on the task, a policy is credited with a reward computed from the knowledge base. The rationale behind this approach is to automatically detect the stepping stones, i.e. the behavior segments that have lead to a reward in the source task before the policy is efficient enough to get the reward on the target task. The approach is tested in simulation with a neuroevolution approach and on ball collecting tasks.","2161-9476","978-1-4799-1036-6","10.1109/DevLrn.2013.6652568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6652568","","Knowledge based systems;Robot sensing systems;Switches;Trajectory;Evolutionary computation;Conferences","continuing professional development;evolutionary computation;intelligent robots;knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;search problems;sensors","life long learning;learning phase;transfer learning problem;sensor values;motor values;population based direct policy search algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;knowledge base;reward shaping approach;source task;neuroevolution approach;ball collecting tasks;knowledge acquisition","","3","","19","","4 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pathway from high frequency modes to the lowest frequency mode is called the coherent swing instability (CSI). The modes are extracted from sensor data or data provided by simulation outputs of power system oscillations by using the Koopman mode analysis that is based on a fully nonlinear spectral theory and represents an extension of linear oscillatory mode analysis. The CSI transmission path is identified by computation of the so-called action transfer operator that is derived by refining a mathematical model of transient stability using the Koopman mode analysis. This provides a new technique for monitoring the loss of transient stability by a combination of practical data, mathematical modeling, and computation.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2183625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165682","Coherent swing instability;energy transfer;Koopman mode;power system;precursor to instability;transient stability","Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Stability analysis;Transient analysis;Mathematical model;Monitoring","mathematical analysis;power system transient stability","nonlinear Koopman modes;power system swing instabilities;transient stability loss;multi-machine power systems;oscillatory modes;high frequency modes;lowest frequency mode;coherent swing instability;power system oscillations;Koopman mode analysis;nonlinear spectral theory;linear oscillatory mode analysis;action transfer operator;practical data;mathematical modeling;mathematical computation","","43","","27","","7 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Equipping inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and embedded devices with subsystems to facilitate WPT allows a UAV to become a viable mobile power delivery vehicle (PDV) and data collection agent. A key challenge is therefore to ensure that a PDV can optimally schedule power delivery across the network, such that it is as reliable and resource efficient as possible. To achieve this and out-perform naive on-demand recharging strategies, we propose a two-stage wireless power network (WPN) approach in which a large network of devices may be grouped into small clusters, where packets of energy inductively delivered to each cluster by the PDV are acoustically distributed to devices within the cluster. We describe a novel dynamic recharge scheduling algorithm that combines genetic weighted clustering with nearest neighbour search to jointly minimize PDV travel distance and WPT losses. The efficacy and performance of the algorithm are evaluated in simulation using experimentally derived traces, and the algorithm is shown to achieve 90% throughput for large, dense networks.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3035645","Natural Environment Research Council; H2020 Marie Skodowska-Curie Actions; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247485","Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network;Wireless Power Network;Optimization Algorithm;Genetic Algorithm;Dynamic Recharge Scheduling","Wireless sensor networks;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Clustering algorithms;Informatics;Robot sensing systems;Acoustics","","","","","","","CCBY","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed method provides a general screening of component outages in order to find potential risk events for the CTS. Furthermore, the severity of each risk event is quantified based on the likelihood of the event and the consequence on the section's transmission capacity. The components' contribution to the risk of insufficient capacity in the CTS is then based on these risk events' severity.

As such, Data Intensive (DI) applications are becoming more and more important and critical. They must be fault-tolerant, they should scale with the amount of data, and be able to elastically leverage additional resources as and when these last ones are provided [3]. Moreover, they should be able to avoid data drops introduced in case of sudden overloads and should offer some Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Ensuring all these properties is, per se, a challenge, but it becomes even more difficult for DI applications, given the large amount of data to be managed and the significant level of parallelism required for its components. Even if today some technological frameworks are available for the development of such applications (for instance, think of Spark, Storm, Flink), we still lack solid software engineering approaches to support their development and, in particular, to ensure that they offer the required properties in terms of availability, throughput, data loss, etc. In fact, at the time of writing, identifying the right solution can require several rounds of experiments and the adoption of many different technologies. This implies the need for highly skilled persons and the execution of experiments with large data sets and a large number of resources, and, consequently, a significant amount of time and budget. To experiment with currently available approaches, we performed an action research experiment focusing on developing- testing-reengineering a specific DI application, Hegira4Cloud, that migrates data between widely used NoSQL databases, including so-called Database as a Service (DaaS), as well as on-premise databases. This is a representative DI system because it has to handle large volumes of data with different structures and has to guarantee that some important characteristics, in terms of data types and transactional properties, are preserved. Also, it poses stringent requirements in terms of correctness, high performance, fault tolerance, and fast and effective recovery. In our action research, we discovered that the literature offered some high level design guidelines for DI applications, as well as some tools to support modelling and QoS analysis/simulation of complex architectures, however the available tools were not yet. suitable to support DI systems. Moreover, we realized that the available big data frameworks we could have used were not flexible enough to cope with all possible application-specific aspects of our system. Hence, to achieve the desired level of performance, fault tolerance and recovery, we had to adopt a time-consuming, experiment-based approach [1, 6], which, in our case, consisted of three iterations: (1) the design and implementation of a Mediation Data Model capable of managing data extracted from different databases, together with a first monholitical prototype of Hegira4Cloud; (2) the improvement of performance of our prototype when managing and transferring huge amounts of data; (3) the introduction of fault-tolerant data extraction and management mechanisms, which are independent from the targeted databases. Among the others, an important issue that has forced us to reiterate in the development of Hegira4Cloud concerned the DaaS we interfaced with. In particular these DaaS, which are well-known services with a large number of users: (1) were missing detailed information regarding the behaviour of their APIs; (2) did not offer a predictable service; (3) were suffering of random downtimes not correlated with the datasets we were experimenting with. In this journal first presentation, we describe our experience and the issues we encountered that led to some important decisions during the software design and engineering process. Also, we analyse the state of the art of software design and verification tools and approaches in the light of our experience, and identify weaknesses, alternative design approaches and open challenges that could generate new research in these areas.

In this paper, the PR-controller action is analyzed and an enhancement is proposed. It is shown that the classical implementation is particularly sensitive to high frequency noises coming from measurements and relocating the proportional action (RPA) on the feedback path can overcome this issue. The proposed improvement was evaluated using bit-true simulations in the Matlab/Simulink® environment.

The switch offers low resistance of 20 /spl mu//spl Omega/ during charge intervals of several hundred milliseconds, controlled time to opening, minimal fuse size, and a relatively fast opening of 0.25-0.7 ms. It serves as a closing switch as well. In a series of experiments, the current of 30-40 kA was commutated routinely from a 0.13 mH inductor into a resistive load at a voltage of 3000 V. Various quenching media were examined. The liquids were found to yield maximum inductively generated voltage and transfer efficiency. A strong correlation exists between the fuse performance and the pressure generated in the fuse. This dependence is used as a guideline in fuse design. It was found that a 2-3 ms fuse conduction time suffices for the recovery of the vacuum switch. A PSpice circuit simulation using an action-dependent fuse model is in good agreement with experimental results. A semi-empirical fuse model based on electron-ion recombination mechanism of the fuse resistance change is proposed. This model is integrated into PSpice circuit simulation.

This paper evaluates the performances of GPC in this context. Although the design method used provides good robust performances in an non-anticipative context, it is shown that unwanted behaviour can occur when anticipation is introduced. First the performances and robustness of the obtained GPC controller are validated in an non-anticipative context. Then, it is shown that an equivalent feedforward filter appears when anticipation is added, which can have bad effects on the system performances.

"Optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction and modeling of MPEG video in ATM networks using pipelined recurrent neural networks","Po-Rong Chang; Jen-Tsung Hu","Dept. of Commun. Eng., Nat. Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","6 Aug 2002","1997","15","6","1087","1100","This paper investigates the application of a pipelined recurrent neural network (PRNN) to the adaptive traffic prediction of MPEG video signal via dynamic ATM networks. The traffic signal of each picture type (I, P, and B) of MPEG video is characterized by a general nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) process. Moreover, a minimum mean-squared error predictor based on the NARMA model is developed to provide the best prediction for the video traffic signal. However, the explicit functional expression of the best mean-squared error predictor is actually unknown. To tackle this difficulty, a PRNN that consists of a number of simpler small-scale recurrent neural network (RNN) modules with less computational complexity is conducted to introduce the best nonlinear approximation capability into the minimum mean-squared error predictor model in order to accurately predict the future behavior of MPEG video traffic in a relatively short time period based on adaptive learning for each module from previous measurement data, in order to provide faster and more accurate control action to avoid the effects of excessive load situation. Since those modules of PRNN can be performed simultaneously in a pipelined parallelism fashion, this would lead to a significant improvement in the total computational efficiency of PRNN. In order to further improve the convergence performance of the adaptive algorithm for PRNN, a learning-rate annealing schedule is proposed to accelerate the adaptive learning process. Another advantage of the PRNN-based predictor is its generalization from learning that is useful for learning a dynamic environment for MPEG video traffic prediction in ATM networks where observations may be incomplete, delayed, or partially available. The PRNN-based predictor presented in this paper is shown to be promising and practically feasible in obtaining the best adaptive prediction of real-time MPEG video traffic.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.611161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=611161","","Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks;Pipeline processing;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Autoregressive processes;Signal processing;Computational complexity;Error correction;Communication system traffic control","asynchronous transfer mode;code standards;telecommunication standards;recurrent neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);prediction theory;pipeline processing;telecommunication computing;autoregressive moving average processes;least mean squares methods;computational complexity;multimedia communication;simulated annealing;adaptive systems;telecommunication traffic;visual communication;video coding","optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction;modeling;MPEG video;ATM networks;pipelined recurrent neural networks;adaptive traffic prediction;general nonlinear autoregressive moving average process;minimum mean-squared error predictor;NARMA model;video traffic signal;small-scale recurrent neural network modules;computational complexity;adaptive learning;excessive load;computational efficiency;convergence performance;learning-rate annealing schedule;dynamic environment","","55","1","27","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, an adaptive exploration strategy with multi-attribute decision-making is proposed to address the trade-off problem between exploration and exploitation. Firstly, the proposed method decomposes a complex task into several sub-tasks and trains each sub-task using the same training method individually. Then, the proposed method uses a multi-attribute decision-making method to develop an action policy integrating the training results of these trained sub-tasks. There are practical advantages to improve learning performance by allowing multiple learners to learn in parallel. An adaptive exploration strategy determines the probability of exploration depending on the information entropy instead of the suffocating work of empirical tuning. Finally, transfer learning extends the applicability of the proposed method. The experiment of the robot migration, the robot confrontation, and the real wheeled mobile robot are used to demonstrate the availability and practicability of the proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973169","Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of Hubei Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8993720","Reinforcement learning;exploration and exploitation;multi-attribute decision-making;adaptive exploration;transfer learning","Task analysis;Decision making;Training;Reinforcement learning;Simulated annealing;Information entropy;Mobile robots","decision making;entropy;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;robot programming","adaptive exploration strategy;multiattribute decision-making method;transfer learning;reinforcement learning agents;robot migration;robot confrontation;real wheeled mobile robot;information entropy","","3","","44","CCBY","11 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During this cascading process, biological information is transferred from one neuron to another (the next) neuron. Many electronic circuits have been designed to implement neural synaptic communication; however, the invention of the memristor has raised the prospect of novel, highly efficient, and miniaturized neural circuit emulation. A novel VLSI circuit emulation of the chemical synaptic process at the biomolecular level (molecular level neuromorphic circuit) has been presented in this paper. Memristors and operational amplifiers in various configurations are key components in this silicon-based emulation. Commencement of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transcription of certain neural gene in the postsynaptic neuron (through Ca+2 ion stimulation) is a major consequence of the synaptic transmission dynamics. Thus, this paper also proposes an integrated circuit model for the postsynaptic neural DNA transcription. A comparison of the silicon-based measured results using the proposed model with experimentally reported biological data justifies the validity of the proposed model.

The basic mechanism of DFDT is quite the same as the distributed coordination function (DCF) of the medium access control (MAC) of IEEE 802.11, which uses a random access delay backoff time after a busy medium condition and RTS/CTS dialogue before sending actual payload data (direct data/ACK could also be used). The enhancement introduced by DFDT is mainly produced by the compilation process (CP), which fits as many MAC layer packets as possible into one physical layer packet within the limit of a predetermined length. By using the CP, we lower the protocol overhead, the packet arrival rate of the physical layer, and network contention all with one action. DFDT takes the advantages of the RTS/CTS mechanism but has less the overhead. Simulation results backed by numerical analysis show growing improvement in performance, limited by the saturation of the network, as the network load gets higher.","1525-3511","0-7803-7700-1","10.1109/WCNC.2003.1200614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200614","","Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks;Access protocols;Physical layer;Mobile ad hoc networks;Media Access Protocol;Delay effects;Payloads;Analytical models;Numerical analysis","access protocols;wireless LAN;transport protocols;ad hoc networks","DFDT;data flushing data transfer protocol;ad hoc wireless network;IEEE 802.11;DCF;distributed coordination function;MAC;medium access control;random access delay backoff time;RTS/CTS mechanism;payload data;compilation process;physical layer packet;network load","","","","21","","28 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the research is focused on importing Three Dimension (3D) geometry data in a Finite Element Method (FEM) applications. This paper presents an innovative two-step methodology (3ds MAX-to-FEM) able to convert a Three Dimension Studio Modeling, Animation & Rendering Software/Autodesk (3ds MAX) file into a FEM for structural simulation. In this study, the 3ds MAX file is a large building, has been carried out with an accurate survey that integrates geometrical aspects, element interconnections, and architectural considerations. Then it is turned into COMSOL Multiphysics environment and tested thermal simulation with a geometric rationalization which preserves irregularities and anomalies, such as verticality deviation and variable thickness. After setting material properties, loads, and boundary conditions, the structural simulation is run with a detailed model that respects the uniqueness and authenticity of the building. A real case study is illustrated and discussed to prove that a rigorous 3ds MAX to FEM workflow allows the generation of an accurate practical methodology for 3D visualization and simulation for thermal distribution operation in COMSOL. Structural simulation was carried out with a 3D mesh derived from the 3ds MAX file in order to take into consideration the geometrical irregularity of a building. COMSOL Multiphysics is a software tool uses artificial intelligent and soft computing for doing computations with high speed and accuracy, and computes and shows different types of phenomenon together.

The main advantage consists in the possibility to exploit renewable sources, industrial waste heat and efficient thermal plants based on fossil fuel. The system is composed by a double pipeline (supply and return) connecting the thermal plants to the heat exchangers located in the buildings. Water is made circulating by the action of pumps located at the plants and along the network. Full exploitation of the capabilities of DH systems can be obtained through optimization of the operating conditions. This is generally performed acting on the production side, by optimizing the operation of the thermal plants, or the network side, by optimizing the supply temperature or the settings of the pumping system. These actions can be boosted through interventions on the demand side. In this framework, knowledge of the demand evolution and the status of the heat exchangers is crucial. This work aims at showing how measurements performed at the heat exchangers can be used while implementing optimal operation strategies. If the four temperatures (two on the network side and two on the building side), the water mass flow rate on the primary side and the external temperature are measured, various pieces of information can be obtained: 1)Thermal demand of each building can be obtained. Using historical data, the thermal demand can be related with the environmental variables in order to create a prediction tool. 2)Using a thermo-fluid dynamic simulator of the network, the thermal load profile of the plants can be obtained. Such reconstruction is important in order to evaluate possible effects that can be obtained by modifying the thermal energy profile of the buildings (e.g. through change in the set points and/or the time the heating system is switched on/off). 3)The dynamic evolution of temperatures on the secondary side can be used in order to evaluate some parameters able to characterize the thermal behavior of the buildings, such as the overall heat transfer coefficient and the characteristic time. These parameters can be used to create a compact model of the buildings able to predict the effect of possible changes in the demand profiles on the indoor comfort conditions. These represent constraints in the operation optimization. 4)Temperatures at the heat exchangers and water mass flow rate can be combined together in order to evaluate the heat exchanger effectiveness and thus monitor this device in order to prevent large fouling. This is of extreme importance in order to keep efficiency high in the district heating network.The present work aims at showing an application of the full procedure to a real district heating network. The various performance parameters are calculated and the procedure is implemented in order to highlight the opportunities for primary energy savings during operation.","0275-0473","978-1-5386-5370-8","10.1109/INTLEC.2018.8612414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8612414","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Buildings;Water heating;Thermal loading;Substations;Temperature measurement;Switches","computational fluid dynamics;district heating;energy conservation;heat exchangers;heat transfer;industrial waste;thermal power stations;waste heat","heat transfer coefficient;thermal behavior;heating system;thermal energy profile;thermal load profile;thermal demand;optimal operation strategies;pumping system;supply temperature;operating conditions;DH systems;efficient thermal plants;industrial waste heat;thermal substations;district heating operation;district heating network;heat exchanger effectiveness;water mass flow rate;heat exchangers;operation optimization","","","","13","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is found that even for bit error rates as high as 10/sup -5/, the loss in performance is only about 25% for large packets, and about 5% for small packets. The delays introduced by error-recovery actions being prematurely triggered by variation in the round trip time (RTT), even on a single-segment Ethernet, are found to contribute more to the overall delay than the delay due to copying and checksumming.

According to cognitive informatics, the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC), which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics, with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics, such as concept algebra, system algebra, realtime process algebra, granular algebra, and visual semantic algebra. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.","","978-1-4244-8042-5","10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599737","Cognitive informatics;abstract intelligence;world-wide wisdom;WWW+;cognitive computing;cognitive computers;computational intelligence;denotational mathematics;next generation internet","Cognitive informatics;Algebra;Computational intelligence;World Wide Web;Computers;Software engineering;Software","Boolean algebra;cognitive systems;computational complexity;inference mechanisms;Internet;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;peer-to-peer computing;search engines","cognitive computing;World Wide Wisdom;next generation Internet;computational intelligent capability;cognitive informatics;natural intelligence;query transfer;information network;network infrastructure;autonomous computer;intelligent computer;machinable thought;computational inference;cognitive learning engine;autonomous learning system;natural language;cognitive search engine;machine learning based search system;cognitive knowledge acquisition;machine supported problem solving;denotational mathematics;concept algebra;system algebra;real time process algebra;granular algebra;visual semantic algebra;Boolean algebra;conventional computing technology;information search based Internet;brain simulation;cyberspace;autonomous super neural cell;information sharing;WWW+ based Internet;computational intelligence;service providing network;distributed agent network;distributed cognitive sensor network;distributed remote control system","","17","","18","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motivation for an in-depth study of dynamic control algorithms, to avoid congestion in high-speed networks under time varying traffic statistics, is provided. The need for real-time traffic measurements and dynamic control actions for long-lived connections is demonstrated. In particular, it is shown through simulations that implementing access control algorithms based on the bandwidth allocation procedures only at connection setup is not sufficient for congestion-free operation of the network. It is further shown that if the bandwidth allocation and the leaky bucket parameters are not dynamically adjusted, the performances of the connections depend on their initial parameters and can be very undesirable as the traffic parameters change over time. Moreover, if corrective actions are not taken, congestion may build up in the network even in the presence of leaky buckets. The simple dynamic approach proposed limits the congestion periods in the network to the time scales of the connection-level controls. Therefore, the probability of many connections sending excess traffic into the network at the same time is greatly reduced, alleviating the congestion problem.<>","","0-8186-3580-0","10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=253341","","Bandwidth;Intelligent networks;High-speed networks;Access control;Traffic control;Asynchronous transfer mode;Communication system traffic control;Tagging;Streaming media;Condition monitoring","asynchronous transfer mode;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic;telecommunications control","congestion control;dynamic bandwidth management;ATM networks;credit management system;high-speed networks;time varying traffic statistics;real-time traffic measurements;dynamic control;simulations;access control algorithms;bandwidth allocation;leaky bucket parameters;traffic parameters","","17","2","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fuzzy dual rate PID is designed by slitting a convention PID into two parts performing at different sampling rate. A Controller Area Network (CAN) is the mode of communication in this system. Furthermore, the Fuzzy-dual rate PID controllers performance is compared with that of a conventional PID controller. Based on the simulation results and experimental results, the fuzzy dual rate PID controller provides a superior position response with a faster rise time, faster settling time and it minimizes the amount of overshoot.","","978-1-5386-1127-2","10.1109/IECON.2017.8216574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8216574","CAN network communication;Digital control;Dual rate PID controller;Fuzzy PID controller;Network Control Systems","Fuzzy logic;DC motors;Delays;Mathematical model;Simulation;Control systems;Transfer functions","adaptive control;control system synthesis;controller area networks;delays;fuzzy control;networked control systems;three-term control","different sampling rate;Controller Area Network;Fuzzy-dual rate PID controllers performance;adaptive fuzzy dual rate PID controller;networked control systems;Network Control Systems;control action update;superior position response;rise time;settling time","","","","21","","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this presentation, we explained the possibilities to improve the upconversion emission efficiency of the nanomaterials by more than 10-fold. First, we verify by aberration corrected TEM technique to show that the recovery of surface defects can enhance visible emission efficiency of the upconversion nanomaterials under near-infrared excitation [1]. Furthermore, we show that by using core-shell-shell structure of the upconversion nanomaterials, we can improve the effective energy transfer between core and shells so that the influence of non-radiative recombination and transfer can be significantly suppressed [2]. As a result, deep ultraviolet emission can be obtained under near-infrared excitation. We also demonstrate that the use of optical feedback can control the population inversion at the upper levels of the lanthanide ions so that high emission efficiency can be sustained by laser action [3]. Finally, the use of phonon to assist population inversion in the Tm3+ doped nanomaterials is explained. It can be shown that upconversion emission efficiency at visible regime can be obtained from the upconversion Tm3+ doped nanomaterials under near-infrared excitation at high temperature (473 K) [4].","2158-3242","978-1-5386-5599-3","10.1109/NUSOD.2018.8570282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570282","Upconversion nanoparticles;lanthanide-doped;emission","Nanomaterials;Nanoparticles;Sociology;Statistics;Energy exchange;Optical feedback;Laser applications","core-shell nanostructures;doping;nanofabrication;nanostructured materials;optoelectronic devices;photoluminescence;population inversion;sodium compounds;thulium;transmission electron microscopy;wide band gap semiconductors","enhance upconversion efficiency;lanthanide-doped nanomaterials;upconversion emission efficiency;lanthanide-doped upconversion nanomaterials;visible emission efficiency;near-infrared excitation;deep ultraviolet emission;high emission efficiency;data storage;multicolor display;bioimaging;optoelectronic devices;aberration corrected TEM;surface defect;core-shell structure;nonradiative recombination;optical feedback control;population inversion;upconversion thulium doped nanomaterials;temperature 473.0 K","","","","4","","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation results show that both intelligent leaky bucket algorithms have significantly outperformed the conventional leaky bucket algorithm, by responding about 160% faster when taking control actions against a nonconforming connection while reducing as much as 50% of the queueing delay experienced by a conforming connection.

This definition of the problem has links with inverse reinforcement learning problems in which the robot autonomously extracts an optimal reward function that defines the goal of the task. By relying on Gaussian mixture models, the proposed approach learns how the different candidate reward functions are combined, and in which contexts or phases of the task they are relevant for explaining the user's demonstrations. The extracted reward profile is then exploited to improve the skill with a self-refinement approach based on expectation-maximization, allowing the imitator to reach a skill level that goes beyond the demonstrations. The approach can be used to reproduce a skill in different ways or to transfer tasks across robots of different structures.

In this paper, an improved dynamic model for the simulation of valve-less piezoelectric pumps is presented. The model is capable of accurate simulation of the pump performance including the natural frequency, flow rate, and pressure drop.

In our previous papers, proposed schemes to guarantee smooth connections to fast movers in spite of frequent movement are LMC (logical macro cell) and parallel polling. LMC-a multicast group of adjacent micro-cells and pollings are emitted from all BSs of the same LMC create a symmetric environment as a virtual single cell so the cell-to-cell movement of a mobile terminal within an LMC can be passed over. Detail of the distributed control for mobility management is described in this article. An extended LMC is introduced to conduct pre-downloading of packets and to allow distributed processing for the LMC switchover. However, the radio active channel is manipulated only at BSs in the LMC range but not in the extended LMC to save radio resources due to the overhead of parallel polling. If the polling response comes to the BS which differs from the central cellpsilas BS of the LMC, this BS will be placed to become the central cell of the new LMC, and polling acknowledgement is multicast to the new extended LMC. The neighboring BS on the movement direction of the target mobile terminal (MT) can realize movement of the MT, and starts actions to join the new LMC by itself without help from the centralized control. These procedures can hide the delay in the cell-to-cell movement of the terminal even when it goes out from the LMC, and guarantee scalable and high-performance control over micro-cellular network. The simulation results tells the handover latency is less than 5 ms, and the throughput for MT in case of the continuous multimedia like moving picture is 2 Mbps over the 54 Mbps wireless interface.","","978-1-4244-1875-6","10.1109/CSNDSP.2008.4610703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4610703","Micro-cellular network;IP packet transfer;Distributed control;Polling-based packet transfer;Logical Macro-cell;Virtual single cell","Mobile communication;Switches;Computer architecture;Passive optical networks;Optical network units;Microprocessors;Mobile computing","distributed control;IP networks;microcellular radio;mobility management (mobile radio);multimedia communication;packet radio networks;telecommunication control","distributed mobility management;micro-cellular network;mobile multimedia metropolitan area network;IP packet transfer;logical macro cell;parallel polling;distributed processing;scalable control system;mobile terminal","","","","10","","29 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We constructed a prototype vehicle with a 3D printer and two motors. This prototype vehicle was used to obtain a dynamic model and, with this model, we developed a controller for navigating the vehicle. The considered visual features are colors of images, specifically, we are interested in detecting road-color. We have constructed a detector based on the color histogram to determine whether a pixel belongs to the road-color class or not. Depending on the number of pixels that belongs to this class, in a region of interest, the controller takes action through the DC-motor of the vehicle. For this simulation, we used a synthetic video database, where objects move toward or away from the camera. We have tested our proposal with video sequences using the model jointly with the controller and we have demonstrated that our proposal can avoid obstacles that move on a straight line or located in random positions on the road.

This paper presents an integrated system that uses a physics-based simulation to predict robot action results and durations, combined with a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner and semantic execution monitoring. We describe a fully integrated system in which a Semantic Execution Monitor (SEM) uses information from the planning domain to perform functional imagination. Based on information obtained from functional imagination, the robot control system decides whether it is necessary to adapt the plan currently being executed. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a PR2 able to carry tall objects on a tray without the objects toppling. Our approach achieves this by simulating robot and object dynamics. A validation shows that robot action results in simulation can be transferred to the real world.

DSP structures include delay elements which need to be synchronized by a clock signal. This paper demonstrates an approach to synthesize molecular reactions to implement DSP operations without requiring a clock signal. In the proposed approach, each delay and output variables are mapped to two types of molecules. The scheduling of the reactions is controlled by absence indicators, i.e., signals transfer according to the absence of other signals. All computations are scheduled in four phases. The input signal and values stored in all delay elements are consumed for computations in the first phase. Results of computations are stored in the first types of molecule corresponding to the delay elements and output variables. During the second phase, the value of the first molecular type is transferred to the second molecular type for the output variable. In the third phase, the values of first types of molecule are transferred to the second types of molecule associated with each delay element. The output molecules are collected in the fourth phase. The method is illustrated by synthesizing a simple FIR filter, an IIR filter, and an 8-point real-valued fast Fourier transform (FFT). The synthesized systems consist of bimolecular reactions and are translated to DNA-strand displacement reactions. The methodology is validated through mass-action simulations of DNA kinetics.

Unfortunately, the substantial contributions that endogenous electrical mechanisms-of-action provide in healing and regulation are often overlooked, resulting in a poor transfer of knowledge from science, to engineering, and finally, to therapy. The wide variety of healing processes, their therapeutic implications, and the devices and protocol designs that are most effective cannot be understood or addressed adequately without an understanding of the endogenous electrical mechanisms-of-action associated with wound healing. Achieving this level of understanding can be enhanced by the use of appropriate models and simulations that are based on physiological/biochemical system response characteristics.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175325","","Wounds;Mathematical model;Electric fields;Current density;Ions;Current;Skin","biochemistry;bioelectric phenomena;biological tissues;biomedical equipment;cellular biophysics;diseases;patient treatment;wounds","therapeutic device-protocol design implications;healing processes;organs;appropriate therapeutic devices;treatment protocols;mechanisms-of-action;interconnected chemical;electrical activities;mechanical activities;optical activities;substantial contributions;therapeutic implications;protocol designs;wound healing;appropriate models","Electric Stimulation Therapy;Wound Healing","","","37","","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, the required filtering specification by the LCL filter is extracted using an appropriate harmonic model of the converter. The design procedure and the filter transfer function are presented. In addition, an active compensator is proposed to enhance the converter power factor by modification of the reference q current.

The boundary of the security region can be approximated using its piecewise-linear approximation. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are used to generate experimental data to build a set of hyperplanes, which form the Security Region for the Wide-area Interconnection. The hyperplanes will be used in real time with State Estimation data and PMU information to evaluate the current security margin and operational transfer capability, to determine the most limiting elements of the grid, and to select optimal remedial actions. Numerical simulations carried out on the WECC system have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach.","","978-1-4244-4428-1","10.1109/NAPS.2009.5484095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484095","Wide-area dynamic security region;Electrical power systems;Hyperplane;WECC","Power system security;Data security;Power system dynamics;Information security;Power system simulation;Piecewise linear techniques;Computer simulation;Computer security;State estimation;Phasor measurement units","numerical analysis;power system security;power system state estimation","wide-area dynamic security region;electrical power systems;piecewise-linear approximation;wide-area interconnection;state estimation data;PMU information;current security margin;operational transfer capability","","1","","24","","14 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lines of action of 43 musculotendon actuators were defined based on their anatomical relationships to three-dimensional bone surface representations. A model for each actuator was formulated to compute its isometric force-length relation. The kinematics of the lower extremity were defined by modeling the hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Thus, the force and joint moment that each musculotendon actuator develops can be computed for any body position. The joint moments calculated with the model compare well with experimentally measured isometric joint moments. A graphical interface to the model has also been developed. It allows the user to visualize the musculoskeletal geometry and to manipulate the model parameters to study the biomechanical consequences of orthopaedic surgical procedures. For example, tendon transfer and lengthening procedures can be simulated by adjusting the model parameters according to various surgical techniques. Results of the simulated surgeries can be analyzed quickly in terms of postsurgery muscle forces and other biomechanical variables.<>","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.102791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=102791","","Orthopedic surgery;Extremities;Joints;Actuators;Solid modeling;Musculoskeletal system;Geometry;Muscles;Humans;Bones","biomechanics;computer graphics;interactive systems;medical computing;physiological models;surgery","subtalar joints;interactive graphics-based model;lower extremity;orthopaedic surgical procedures;musculoskeletal geometry;musculotendon parameters;muscle force;moment;lines of action;anatomical relationships;three-dimensional bone surface representations;model;actuator;isometric force-length relation;kinematics;hip;knee;ankle;metatarsophalangeal joints;graphical interface;postsurgery muscle forces;biomechanical variables","Biomechanics;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Joints;Joints;Leg;Leg;Models, Anatomic;Movement;Musculoskeletal Physiology;Musculoskeletal System;Musculoskeletal System;Orthopedics;User-Computer Interface","1200","46","46","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this reason very accurate and efficient simulation models of these industrial devices based on a power dispatch PWM kernel, which is a non linear process, are required during the computer aided design phase for performance related prediction and evaluation before hardware prototyping and large scale production begins. This is particularly important in the integrated circuit design of high fidelity Class D audio amplifiers and in embedded high performance industrial motor drives systems for robotic applications. In this paper a new mathematical model for PWM simulation and analysis is presented which is based on a novel concept of a modulated single Fourier series (MFS) time function. The validity of this analytical Fourier model is first proven and the accuracy is then checked by simulating the action of a classical natural sampled PWM analog comparator modulator fed with a triangular carrier and a variety of arbitrary non periodic signals. Results are presented to establish the accuracy of the MFS strategy in high performance industrial brushless motor drive (BLMD) simulation, instead of classical iterative solutions of analog comparator modulator operation for PWM representation, with experimental test data.","0191-2216","0-7803-7924-1","10.1109/CDC.2003.1272282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1272282","","Pulse width modulation;Fourier series;Mathematical model;Space vector pulse width modulation;Brushless motors;Pulsed power supplies;Analytical models;Pulse amplifiers;Switches;Uninterruptible power systems","pulse width modulation;brushless DC motors;DC motor drives;Fourier series;electric machine CAD","pulsewidth modulation;nonlinear process;dispatch PWM kernel;computer aided design phase;modulated single Fourier series time function;industrial brushless motor drive simulation;integrated circuit design;class D audio amplifiers","","5","1","10","","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

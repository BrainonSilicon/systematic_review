"Early Results of a Usability Evaluation of Two Digital Human Model -based Ergonomic Software Applying Eye-Tracking Methodology Comparison of the usability of ViveLab and Jack software","M.

There are various software for ergonomics available on the market, and it would be important to know which one to choose in various research tasks. Although data on the capabilities of the software can be found relatively easily, a comparison regarding their ease of use and the quality of their user interface cannot be found in the literature. In this article, the usability of two software were compared. A cloud based Hungarian software, ViveLab and the well-known Jack software was chosen. In addition to the traditional software usability testing technique based on screen and event recording and user camera, eye-tracking methodology was also applied. The goal of this research is to find out which software is more usable in different situations. The results were divisive and in some cases astonishing. We are not able to give a definite answer which software is easier to use. There were several cases when ViveLab was easier and almost as much cases when Jack. There are areas for improvement in both software. Our results can help researchers to choose software for their specific tasks. Furthermore, the results can give additional information on which user interface elements and concepts are worth to improve by developers of the ergonomic software, and, in some cases, may inspire developers of other 3D-based software in general.","2380-7350","978-1-7281-4793-2","10.1109/CogInfoCom47531.2019.9089993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089993","Usability testing;Eye-tracking;Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE);Digital Human Model;Computer Aided Anthropometric Design (CAAD);Software for ergonomic risk assessment;ViveLab;Jack","Usability;Ergonomics;Task analysis;Solid modeling;Lifting equipment;Risk management","ergonomics;gaze tracking;human computer interaction;tracking;user interfaces","event recording;user camera;ViveLab;user interface elements;usability evaluation;digital human model;Jack software;analysis software;ergonomics;research tasks;Hungarian software;traditional software usability;eye-tracking methodology comparison;ergonomic software","","","","31","","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, visual information is necessary in human-robot cooperation. In general, by using visual information feedback, the posture error between manipulators and fingers is computed to adjust the system input. Because robotic manipulators have redundant degree-of-freedom (DOF), a variety of tasks can be performed at the same time. However, conflicts may occur between tasks and the stability of the system cannot be guaranteed. The control spaces of redundant manipulators are divided into work-space and null-space. As the number of the DOF increases, the calculation of the null-space term becomes more complicated. This paper describes a novel approach of advanced observer design of visual feedback redundant manipulators by using the task-priority control strategy. In order to avoid the conflicts of multiple tasks, the task-priority control strategy is employed in our system. In the proposed approach, a RIC structure based work-space observer is designed. We also utilize this work-space observer in hierarchical null-spaces to simplify the calculation. The validity of the proposed approach is verified by a simulation. The results suggest that the proposed work-space observer has better performance than the conventional work-space observer in hierarchical null-spaces.","","978-1-4673-1388-9","10.1109/ICMECH.2013.6518541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6518541","Visual feedback;Redundant manipulator;Task-priority control strategy;Hierarchical null-spaces;Work-space observer (WOB)","Manipulators;Observers;Joints;Acceleration;Robustness;Kinematics","compensation;control system synthesis;feedback;human-robot interaction;manipulator dynamics;observers;redundant manipulators;robot vision;robust control","human-robot cooperation;visual information feedback;posture error;robotic manipulators;redundant degree-of-freedom;advanced observer design;visual feedback redundant manipulators;task-priority control strategy;RIC structure based work-space observer design;hierarchical null-spaces;robust internal-loop compensator","","1","","10","","23 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is particularly remarkable that this success has been achieved on the basis of comparatively small datasets, given the scale of the problem. One explanation is that this has been accomplished partly by exploiting bias in the datasets rather than developing deeper multi-modal reasoning. This fundamentally limits the generalization of the method, and thus its practical applicability. We propose a method that addresses this problem by introducing counterfactuals in the training. In doing so we leverage structural causal models for counterfactual evaluation to formulate alternatives, for instance, questions that could be asked of the same image set.

We attempt to address these challenges by proposing a dialogue management architecture that has an abstracted view of the world but yet is able to focus on relevant parts of the ontology at runtime. Specifically, we train a sub-domain identifier neural network that learns which features are relevant to the current turn and the immediate future, thus filtering out irrelevant information from the ontology and consequently the belief space at each dialogue turn. We then train a policy network that needs: a) to adapt to the sub-domain identifier's output; and b) to learn what information will carry over from previous turns and when it needs to be updated. We evaluate our method on a large information-seeking ontology that contains latent sub-domains. Our results in simulation and a small human trial show that the sub-domain identifier is able to generalise to unseen domains and achieve performance on par with a multi-domain dialogue manager where each sub-domain is carefully defined (golden standard).","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461754","Spoken Dialogue Management;Multiple Domains;Dialogue Policy;Policy Network","Ontologies;Electronics packaging;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Face;Neural networks","human computer interaction;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;neural nets;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","trained policy models;sub-domain identifier neural network;abstracted view;dialogue management architecture;multidomain dialogue systems;scalable information-seeking multidomain dialogue;multidomain dialogue manager;unseen domains;latent sub-domains;information-seeking ontology;policy network;dialogue turn;irrelevant information","","","","17","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While it presents numerous advantages with respect to other robot imitation frameworks in terms of generalization and portability, final robot joint trajectories for the execution of actions are not necessarily encoded within the model. This is studied as an optimization problem, and the solution is computed through evolutionary algorithms in simulated environments. Evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations, which had made the use of these algorithms in real world applications very challenging. This paper presents online evolutionary strategies, as a change of paradigm within CGDA execution. Online evolutionary strategies shift and merge motor execution into the planning loop. A concrete online evolutionary strategy, Online Evolved Trajectories (OET), is presented. OET drastically reduces computational times between motor executions, and enables working in real world dynamic environments and/or with human collaboration. Its performance has been measured against Full Trajectory Evolution (FTE)and Incrementally Evolved Trajectories (IET), obtaining the best overall results.

This hybrid nature is especially useful as a means for guiding design scenarios in classroom instruction. We first considered different application domains such as community physical activity and how they leveraged smart watches. From these domains, we elicited general ground rules that inform our approach for using smart watches in a computer science course. We then synthesize and describe five design guidelines that directed our approach to teaching and evaluating students' designs. We assessed and evaluated these guidelines in a third-year level mobile computing class where students were asked to consider them as part of a three-week design and development assignment. After concluding the assignment, the students were asked to complete a survey to capture their experience with the use of the design guidelines, and to also provide general feedback on the suitability of these design goals. Throughout these exercises, we found the design guidelines to be especially useful in three ways: in providing small-screen specific design and development experience, in affording practice and reinforcement of core mobile computing topics, and as a means to meaningfully contribute to socially relevant projects. We contribute to the computing education corpus by detailing the five design guidelines, how they can be used to lead higher-level computer courses, and how they can be used as a lens in considering design approaches in general.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274280","Smartwatch;Mobile;Health and Wellness;Design","Guidelines;Smart phones;Mobile computing;Education;Computer science;Software;Computer science education","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;mobile computing;teaching;wearable computers","design guidelines;small-screen specific design;computing education corpus;higher-level computer courses;smartwatch-centered design;research-to-practice paper;smartwatches;college level computer science class;smart phones;computer science course;teaching;third-year level mobile computing class;three-week design;mobile computing topics;wristwatches;classroom instruction;community physical activity","","","","23","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a general approach to playing video games, this has many inviting properties: no need for specialized modifications to the game, no lengthy training sessions and the ability to re-use the same tools across different games. However, related work includes game-specific engineering to achieve the results. We take a step towards a general approach and study the general applicability of behavioural cloning on twelve video games, including six modern video games (published after 2010), by using human demonstrations as training data. Our results show that these agents cannot match humans in raw performance but do learn basic dynamics and rules.

We categorize three classes of approach that may be applied to this problem, namely, 1) direct, 2) feature-based, and 3) inverse optimal approaches to transfer. While the first is restricted to highly biomorphic plants, the latter two are shown to be sufficiently general to be applied to various VIAs in a way that is independent of the mechanical design. As instantiations of such transfer schemes, 1) a constraint-based method and 2) an apprenticeship learning framework are proposed, and their suitability to different problems in robotic imitation, in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and task performance, is characterized.

Trust and reputation models were used together to implement this demeanor. In this paper we discuss an implementation of this framework inside the game Settlers of Catan.

Secondly, the joint friction parameters were identified using a friction torque model in the harmonic gear drive system.

Statistical methods, however, require the availability of sufficiently large data sets. As a result, experimental paradigms used to collect behavioral trials from individuals are data centered and not user centered. This means that experimental paradigms are tuned to collect as many trials as possible, are generally rather demanding, and are not always motivating or engaging for individuals. Subject cooperation and their compliance with the task may decrease over time. Whenever possible, paradigms are designed to control for factors such as fatigue, attention, and motivation. In this paper, we propose the use of the Kinect motion tracking sensor (Microsoft, Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) in a game-based paradigm for noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based functional motor mapping. Results from an experimental study with able-bodied subjects playing a virtual ball game suggest that the Kinect sensor is useful for isolating specific movements during the interaction with the game, and that the computed EEG patterns for hand and feet movements are in agreement with results described in the literature.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2250287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472046","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);functional brain mapping;motion tracking;serious games","Electroencephalography;Games;Tracking;Brain mapping;Brain;Joints;Monitoring","behavioural sciences;computer games;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;statistical analysis;virtual reality","computer games;noninvasive EEG-based functional brain mapping;statistical models;statistical inference;brain structures;human behavior;neuroscience;statistical methods;behavioral trials;data centered trials;user centered trialsv;experimental paradigms;Kinect motion tracking sensor;game-based paradigm;noninvasive electroencephalogram-based functional motor mapping;EEG-based functional motor mapping;able-bodied subjects;virtual ball game;Kinect sensor;computed EEG patterns;hand movement;feet movement","","17","","35","","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, the structural information from the modeller gives valuable hints to the renderer to determine efficient interactive display strategies through the use of level-of-detail and culling techniques. Thus a modeller that knows the operator is creating houses can use this information to simplify the user interaction, guide the operator, and to create models that build in optimisations when attempting real-time rendering. In this paper we discuss the way in which polygonal and multi-resolution surface techniques can complement one another in the modelling of urban environments.

Then, based on the analysis of the route natural language corpus, this paper proposes several common chunks of route natural language, and carries out the chunking experiment.

In both cases, a learner has to resolve concurrently multiple types of ambiguities while learning how to act in response to particular contexts through the observation of a teacher's demonstrations. We argue that computational models of language acquisition and models of motor skill learning by demonstration have so far only considered distinct subsets of these types of ambiguities, leading to the use of distinct families of techniques across two loosely connected research domains. We present a computational model, mixing concepts and techniques from these two domains, involving a simulated robot learner interacting with a human teacher. Proof-of-concept experiments show that: 1) it is possible to consider simultaneously a larger set of ambiguities than considered so far in either domain; and 2) this allows us to model important aspects of language acquisition and motor learning within a single process that does not initially separate what is “linguistic” from what is “nonlinguistic.” Rather, the model shows that a general form of imitation learning can allow a learner to discover channels of communication used by an ambiguous teacher, thus addressing a form of abstract Gavagai problem (ambiguity about which observed behavior is “linguistic”, and in that case which modality is communicative).","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2013.2279277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588874","Discovering linguistic channels;imitation learning;language acquisition;motor Gavagai problem;robot learning by demonstration;sensorimotor learning","Context;Pragmatics;Acoustic waves;Computational modeling;Speech;Robot sensing systems","human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;robot programming","motor learning by demonstration;ambiguous teacher;simulated robot learner;proof-of-concept experiments;motor skill learning;teacher demonstrations;human teachers;multiple context-dependent sensorimotor skills;language acquisition;Gavagai problem;nonlinguistic sensorimotor skills;multiple linguistic skills;unified imitation learning","","2","","69","","4 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inferring the forces applied to the person's body by the garment might enable a robot to provide more effective assistance and give the robot insight into what the person feels. However, complex mechanics govern the relationship between the robot's end effector and these forces. Using a physics-based simulation and data-driven methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of inferring forces across a person's body using only end effector measurements. Specifically, we present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that at each time step takes a 9-dimensional input vector of force, torque, and velocity measurements from the robot's end effector and outputs a force map consisting of hundreds of inferred force magnitudes across the person's body. We trained and evaluated LSTMs on two tasks: pulling a hospital gown onto an arm and pulhng shorts onto a leg. For both tasks, the LSTMs produced force maps that were similar to ground truth when visualized as heat maps across the limbs. We also evaluated their performance in terms of root-mean-square error. Their performance degraded when the end effector velocity was increased outside the training range, but generalized well to limb rotations. Overall, our results suggest that robots could learn to infer the forces people feel during robot-assisted dressing, although the extent to which this will generalize to the real world remains an open question.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989718","","Force;Clothing;End effectors;Force measurement;Estimation;Legged locomotion","clothing;end effectors;force control;human-robot interaction;mean square error methods;service robots;velocity control","applied forces;robot-assisted dressing;garment;complex mechanics;physics-based simulation;data-driven methods;long short-term memory network;LSTM;9-dimensional input vector;velocity measurements;force map;inferred force magnitudes;hospital gown;heat maps;root-mean-square error;end effector velocity;training range","","12","","24","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of the proposed distance-ratio classifier was compared with support-vector-machine-based classifiers, using different feature extraction and dimensionality reduction approaches, including principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, kernel principal component analysis, greedy kernel principal component analysis, and generalized discriminant analysis. Extensive computer simulations were conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RTERS. Using two widely used databases for performance evaluation, the best performance of the proposed RTERS was 95.8% using the generalized discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction and the proposed distance-ratio classifier.","1050-4729","978-1-4673-1405-3","10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224587","Human Emotion Identification;Emotional Intelligence;Facial Expression Analysis;Socially Intelligent Robots","Feature extraction;Databases;Vectors;Training;Real time systems;Support vector machines;Engines","emotion recognition;face recognition;human-robot interaction;image classification;image sequences;principal component analysis;robot vision;support vector machines","real-time emotion identification;socially intelligent robots;real-time emotion recognition system;image sequence;face localization;recognition engine;distance-based classifier;distance-ratio classifier;support-vector-machine-based classifiers;dimensionality reduction approaches;feature extraction;linear discriminant analysis;greedy kernel principal component analysis;generalized discriminant analysis;RTERS","","6","","31","","28 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Differential dynamic programming is employed, which allows taking the full, nonlinear human dynamics into consideration. The biomechanical dynamics of the human is modeled by a six link rigid body including leg, trunk and arm segments. Accuracy of the proposed modelling approach is evaluated for different human healthy subjects by comparing simulations and experimentally collected data. Acceptable model accuracy is achieved with a generic set of constant weights that prioritize the different criteria. The proposed STS model is finally used to determine optimal assistive strategies to be performed by a robotic mobility assistant suitable for either a person with specific body segment weakness or a more general weakness.","2155-1782","978-1-4799-3128-6","10.1109/BIOROB.2014.6913855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913855","","Biological system modeling;Joints;Trajectory;Data models;Torque;Cost function;Biomechanics","assisted living;feedback;gait analysis;handicapped aids;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;mobile robots;nonlinear dynamical systems;optimal control;robot dynamics;service robots;torque control","human sit-to-stand transfer modeling;assistive robots;very complex sensorimotor processes;nonlinear musculoskeletal system;unassisted human STS transfer;assisted human STS transfer;optimal feedback control problem;task end-point accuracy;human balance;jerk;effort;torque change;human biomechanical control constraints;differential dynamic programming;nonlinear human dynamics;human biomechanical dynamics;rigid body;robotic mobility assistant","","2","","27","","2 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A long-term goal is to enhance empathic reasoning in children and respect for plants and life in general, using affect as a communicative interface (even though the underlying system is not emotive per se).

Recent work on the image-based reconstruction of spatially varying BRDFs enables the generation of high quality models of real objects from a sparse set of input data.

While human motion is generally limited to 10 Hz, virtual environments with unilateral constraints are subject to excitation of a wider frequency spectrum through contact transitions. We employ the effective impedance decomposition to discuss the effects of parasitics outside the rendering bandwidth. We also introduce an analysis of the admittance and impedance controllers with respect to sensitivity to load cell noise. We explore these effects using a single degree-of-freedom device that can be configured for either a low or high mechanical advantage in a perceptual experiment, with experimental conditions designed through application of the effective impedance decomposition.

In contrast, humans program robotic behaviours by indicating desired object locations and poses to be achieved [5], by providing RGB images of goal configurations [19], or supplying a demonstration to be imitated [17]. None of these methods generalize across environment variations, and they convey the goal in awkward technical terms. This work proposes joint learning of natural language grounding and instructable behavioural policies reinforced by perceptual detectors of natural language expressions, grounded to the sensory inputs of the robotic agent. Our supervision is narrated visual demonstrations (NVD), which are visual demonstrations paired with verbal narration (as opposed to being silent). We introduce a dataset of NVD where teachers perform activities while describing them in detail. We map the teachers' descriptions to perceptual reward detectors, and use them to train corresponding behavioural policies in simulation. We empirically show that our instructable agents (i) learn visual reward detectors using a small number of examples by exploiting hard negative mined configurations from demonstration dynamics, (ii) develop pick-and-place policies using learned visual reward detectors, (iii) benefit from object-factorized state representations that mimic the syntactic structure of natural language goal expressions, and (iv) can execute behaviours that involve novel objects in novel locations at test time, instructed by natural language.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578830","","Visualization;Natural languages;Detectors;Grounding;Task analysis;Speech recognition;Microphones","data mining;feature extraction;human computer interaction;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;object detection;software agents","narrated visual demonstrations;pick-and-place policies;RGB images;narrated demonstrations;reward learning;hard negative mined configurations;instructable agents;perceptual reward detectors;verbal narration;robotic agent;natural language expressions;instructable behavioural policies;natural language grounding","","1","","54","","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, the development of traffic control towards on-line measurement of cooperative aspects between humans and machines, is part of the more general need to measure the human agents “situation awareness” in industrial environment. The University of Modena and Reggio Emilia was partner of the European Artemis project “Designing Dynamic Distributed Cooperative Human-Machine Systems” (D3CoS 2011-2014) [1] to define affordable methods, techniques and tools addressing the specification, development and evaluation of cooperative systems where human and machine agents are in charge of common tasks, assigned to the system as a whole. One of the basic keys to reach an optimal human-machine cooperation is the measure of the human operator workload. In order to setup a possible method for the objective evaluation of cognitive workload we had to investigate aspects of the functional status of human operators interacting with a simulator in maritime domains. We recorded objective psycho-physiological measures: eye blinks, respiration rate and amplitude, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and blood pressure. They were analyzed and correlated with subjective self-assessed responses from two questionnaires: NASA-TLX and Rating Scale Mental Effort (RSME), with the aim to realize a mathematical model for classifying the operators' mental workload. The purpose of this paper is to present the methods, applied on a pilot study, that we carried out to discriminate the WL intensity, based on psycho-physiological signals alone.","","978-1-5386-3906-1","10.1109/RTSI.2017.8065962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8065962","mental workload;EMD;psycho-physiological signals;R cran","Heart rate variability;Electrocardiography;Blood pressure;Biomedical monitoring;Software","cognition;cooperative systems;electrocardiography;human computer interaction;marine engineering;medical signal processing;physiology;psychology","objective assessment;operator cognitive workload;vessel traffic service;VTS;maritime domain;traffic control systems;human machine cooperative aspects;Modena University;Reggio Emilia;European Artemis project;designing dynamic distributed cooperative human-machine systems;cooperative systems;human agents;machine agents;optimal human-machine cooperation;psycho-physiological measures;eye blinks;respiration rate;electrodermal activity;heart rate variability;blood pressure;NASA-TLX;rating scale mental effort;RSME;HMI;human machine interaction;ECG signal","","","","14","","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cameras already exist in many settings such as smartphones, or moving objects such as UAV-mounted cameras. Since many critical infrastructure (CI) problems often are first noticed by the general public and then reported, their qualitative descriptions can then be accompanied with quantitative measurements by using the indirect measurement of parameters provided using machine vision. In this paper, the authors propose a framework using Agile IoT to add new modalities to already existing sensors (cameras) such as smartphone devices to determine additional parameters using machine vision. This can result in an increase in situational awareness, and meanwhile, response and repair times can decrease, then the overall infrastructure resilience increases. This has the potential to improve preventative maintenance and increase resilience by increasing situational awareness, so resources can be deployed quickly and efficiently where they are needed. This proposed framework can apply to multiple small infrastructure such as lighting standards, playground structures, signage, access gates and fences, electrical wires, and utility poles and its affixed hardware components. The paper shows a proof-of-concept application of this methodology to the concept of tilt detection, with lean determined from simulated and field images.

The performance of evolutionary search is important as user interaction fatigue remains an on-going challenge in IEC. However, to obtain optimal search performance, it is usually necessary to “tune” evolutionary control parameters manually, although tuning control parameters can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue in other fields of evolutionary computation, dynamic parameter control including deterministic, adaptive and self-adaptive mechanisms have been applied extensively to real-valued representations. This paper postulates that dynamic parameter control may be highly beneficial to IEC in general, and UML software design in particular, wherein a novel object-based solution representation is used. Three software design problems from differing design domains and of differing scale have been investigated with mutation probabilities modified by simulated annealing, the Rechenberg “1/5 success rule” and self-adaptation within local search. Results indicate that self-adaptation appears to be the most robust and scalable mutation probability modification mechanism.

This literature survey aimed to investigate: (1) what haptic systems (in terms of function, haptic signal, channel, and supported task) have been experimentally tested, (2) how these haptic systems have been evaluated, and (3) their reported effects on driver performance and behaviour. We reviewed empirical research in which participants had to drive a vehicle in a real or simulated environment, were able to control the heading and/or speed of the vehicle, and a haptic signal was provided to them. The results indicated that a clear distinction can be made between warning systems (using vibrations) and guidance systems (using continuous forces). Studies typically used reaction time measures for evaluating warning systems and vehicle-centred performance measures for evaluating guidance systems. In general, haptic warning systems reduced the reaction time of a driver compared to no warnings, although these systems may cause annoyance. Guidance systems generally improved the performance of drivers compared to non-aided driving, but these systems may suffer from after-effects. Longitudinal research is needed to investigate the transfer and retention of effects caused by haptic support systems.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2015.2437871","European Marie Curie ITN project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113879","driver assistance systems;warnings;haptic guidance;automotive;automation;human-machine systems;Driver assistance systems;warnings;haptic guidance;automotive;automation;human-machine systems","Haptic interfaces;Human computer interaction;Alarm systems;Road transportation;Driver assistance systems;Time measurement","driver information systems;haptic interfaces","haptic driver support systems;haptic signal;guidance systems;vehicle-centred performance measures;haptic warning systems","Automobile Driving;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Physical Stimulation;Touch","51","","99","","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper presents new algorithms and techniques for the acquisition and real-time interaction with complex textured 3D objects and shows how these results can be seamlessly integrated with previous work into a single framework for the acquisition, processing, and interactive display of high quality 3D models. In addition to pure geometry, such algorithms also have to take into account the texture of an object (which is crucial for a realistic appearance) and its reflectance behavior. The measurement of accurate material properties is an important step towards photorealistic rendering, where both the general surface properties as well as the spatially varying effects of the object are needed. Recent work on the image-based reconstruction of spatially varying BRDFs (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) enables the generation of high quality models of real objects from a sparse set of input data. Efficient use of the capabilities of advanced PC graphics hardware allows for interactive rendering under arbitrary viewing and lighting conditions and realistically reproduces the appearance of the original object.","","0-7695-1948-2","10.1109/ICIAP.2003.1234044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234044","","Pipelines;Three dimensional displays;Geometry;Reflectivity;Material properties;Rendering (computer graphics);Surface reconstruction;Image reconstruction;Bidirectional control;Distribution functions","realistic images;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;virtual reality;reflectivity;image texture;multimedia computing;image reconstruction;computer vision;image colour analysis;colour graphics","virtualization pipeline;virtual 3D models;multimedia data type;e-commerce;online encyclopaedias;virtual museums;complex textured objects;realistic appearance;photorealistic rendering;surface properties;spatially varying effects;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;PC graphics hardware;interactive rendering;computer vision;color properties","","1","","36","","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a robotic teammate, the ability to generate explanations to justify its behavior is one of the key requirements of explainable agency. Prior work on explanation generation has been focused on supporting the rationale behind the robot's decision or behavior. These approaches, however, fail to consider the mental demand for understanding the received explanation. In other words, the human teammate is expected to understand an explanation no matter how much information is presented. In this work, we argue that explanations, especially those of a complex nature, should be made in an online fashion during the execution, which helps spread out the information to be explained and thus reduce the mental workload of humans in highly cognitive demanding tasks. However, a challenge here is that the different parts of an explanation may be dependent on each other, which must be taken into account when generating online explanations. To this end, a general formulation of online explanation generation is presented with three variations satisfying different ""online"" properties. The new explanation generation methods are based on a model reconciliation setting introduced in our prior work. We evaluated our methods both with human subjects in a simulated rover domain, using NASA Task Load Index (TLX), and synthetically with ten different problems across two standard IPC domains. Results strongly suggest that our methods generate explanations that are perceived as less cognitively demanding and much preferred over the baselines and are computationally efficient.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341792","","NASA;Planning;Task analysis;Artificial intelligence;Standards;Intelligent robots;Load modeling","decision making;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;path planning;planetary rovers","online explanation generation;human-robot teaming;explainable AI;decision-making process;robotic agent;robotic teammate;explainable agency;received explanation;human teammate;explanation generation methods;NASA task load index","","","","30","","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article contributes a novel cluster-based algorithm that allows a robot to create generalized models of its interactive partner. These generalized models, or stereotypes, act as a source of information for predicting the human's behavior and preferences. We show, in simulation and using real robots, that these stereotyped models of the partner can be used to bootstrap the robot's learning about the partner in spite of significant error.

Today, screen reading software and Braille displays or text-to-speech systems have solved many problems of accessing text. For accessing graphics, and specifically digital graphics, there is to date no standardised technology that is accepted and used by blind people. Especially in school education, access to pictures is almost impossible to master; making teamwork very complicated and thus isolating blind students from their sighted peers making it impossible to acquire a shared understanding of school material. Focusing on geometry, which is believed to be the main theory of space, is very crucial for non-sighted students to develop an accurate spatial sense and reasoning.

Temporal reasoning provides a general mechanism integrating various types of temporal constraints on airlift events to provide time bounds on execution of the complete plan. Physical limitations of the aircraft and operating facilities and the availability of cargo produce constraints on when certain events may occur. Constraints include the time required to fly from one location to another, or the time spent waiting for an aircraft to be loaded. Comparing cargo requirements with airlift capacity over time provides additional constraints. By considering these constraints and their interactions, the planner is in a better position to assess the impact of high-level planning decisions.

Making of twelve-tone rows which is the first process of the twelve-tone technique is an important process to determine the subject and atmosphere of music. However, it is difficult for a human without the knowledge of music to evaluate twelve-tone rows. In this paper, we design the fitness function based on the relation between the consonance interval and dissonant interval that are a part of general musical theory and perform the automatic generation of twelve-tone row by searching the consonance tone row with GA.

The traditional exoskeleton based on fully actuated joints can provide powerful assistance for human motion, while it is bulky requiring a large energy consumption, which limits its application. The passive and quasi-passive exoskeletons are weak in the load-carrying condition due to the lack of active actuators. The traditional underactuated exoskeleton with only one joint actuated generally has limited power assistance. As for soft exoskeleton, uncomfortable feeling resulting from the pressure generated by cable tension on muscles are unavoidable. To compensate these drawbacks, this paper presents a lower limb exoskeleton based on the cable-pulley underactuated principle. By studying the synergies of torque and power assistance at the joints and designing the control strategy, a single cable will be able to drive the hip joint and the knee joint simultaneously, which can reduce the number of actuators. Considering the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics, a biological method is utilized to evaluate the performance of the exoskeleton. Finally, the contrast simulation results demonstrate that the exoskeleton proposed in this paper can effectively provide power augmentation in load-carrying walking without interfering the human motion and the control strategy is feasible.","2152-744X","978-1-5090-6759-6","10.1109/ICMA.2017.8015881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8015881","lower limb exoskeleton;underactuated mechanism;dynamics;simulation","Exoskeletons;Hip;Knee;Torque;Mechanical cables;Legged locomotion;Pulleys","cables (mechanical);human-robot interaction;legged locomotion;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;pulleys;robot dynamics","cable-pulley underactuated lower limb exoskeleton;load-carrying augmentation;walking assistance;rehabilitation training;fully actuated joints;human motion assistance;muscle cable tension;control strategy design;hip joint;knee joint;human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics;biological method;power augmentation;load-carrying walking;robotic leg","","","","13","","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The infrared information of the surrounding area are used mainly for two different purposes: Navigation and Search & Track-While-Scan. Navigation functions, commonly identified with the name of Imaging Modes, are devoted to aid pilots in conjunction with advanced human machine interfaces such as Head Up Display (HUD) and Helmet Mounted Display (HMD). The availability of IR images generated from airborne opto-electronics equipment can support the pilot during navigation in adverse weather conditions, providing important information about external threats (i.e. obstacles), otherwise not detectable by human eye. Search & Track-While-Scan, is a functionality related to surveillance. It includes combination of automatic detection and tracking functions within a wide search volume.

The proposed software is implemented in a fully object-oriented structure that provides real-time interaction with a PHANToM/spl trade/ haptic device, as a diagnostic tool for medical experts. The software allows radiology experts to visualize, display and interact with the graphical model of a patient's pre-scanned organ or tissue. The expert is also able to re-slice through pre-registered model data sets and view the 2D reslice images in different modalities simultaneously. The haptic interface guarantees position correspondence between the operator's hand and a virtual probe. Thus the simulated procedure emulates actual examinations condition in clinic.

Examining the model parameters provides insight into application behaviors and how they interact with the system. Second, we create a model that captures such heterogeneous processor behavior, which is important for analyzing memory system design tradeoffs. Highly bursty memory request traffic and lock contention are also modeled in a significantly more robust way than in previous work. With these features, the model is applicable to a wide range of architectures and applications. Although the features increase the model complexity, it is a useful design tool because the size of the model input parameter set remains manageable, and the model is still several orders of magnitude quicker to solve than detailed simulation. Validation results show that the model is highly accurate, producing heterogeneous per processor throughputs that are generally within 5 percent and, for the workloads validated, always within 13 percent of the values measured by detailed simulation with SimOS.

In order to evaluate the process of typing with the tip of the tongue, eight volunteers participated in tip-of-tongue selectivity training experiments using an inductive tongue-computer interface. Performance data based on typing speed and accuracy fits a general learning model based on the power law of practice, which can be used to estimate further improvements of tongue-typing performance.

As predicted, the ""send"" icon was effective in maintaining information flow, particularly when time pressure was high and simulated teammates sent less information, because it reduced memory burden and supported proactive behavior. The ""receive"" icon was only effective in supporting decision accuracy when time pressure was low. As time pressure increased, participants' with the ""receive"" icon increasingly used a strategy of making decisions before reading the most important information, completely counter to expectations. These results illustrate the subtle, sometimes surprising way task characteristics (e.g., time pressure) can affect participants' strategies and, thereby, nullify the positive effect of displays on performance.

Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2560882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463035","Complexity;fidelity;level of detail artificial intelligence (LOD AI);multiagent systems;multiobjective optimization","Complexity theory;Multi-agent systems;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Learning systems;Games","computational complexity;computer animation;computer games;evolutionary computation;multi-agent systems;Pareto optimisation;statistical analysis;virtual reality","multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary computing techniques;multiobjective evolutionary framework;simulation model complexity;behavioral fidelity;virtual worlds;objective function;multiagent systems;video games;nonplayer characters;NPC animation;realistic graphics;human aesthetic judgment bootstrapping;Pareto-optimal frontiers","","1","","36","Traditional","29 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such complexity is well exemplified by cooling systems in ground vehicles with hybrid powerplants, which typically consist of multiple sub-systems. Distributed, multi-resolution simulations sidestep these difficulties by: a) partitioning the system into interacting components that can be represented by models of varying levels of fidelity; and b) executing the component models in parallel, with each model exchanging information with the others in real time. The subsystems can be coupled to one another through the interactions of selected elements. Vehicle tests were conducted to evaluate the modeling approach. Prototyping and validation examples are given multi-component systems used for cooling of hybrid powerplants over a wide range of operating conditions. Simulation results were compared to experimental data gathered at component and vehicle levels. Most of the model predictions deviated from the test data by less than 5%. Results indicate that distributed multi-resolution simulations can significantly accelerate the analysis of flow-thermal processes in complex vehicle systems.

Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning have been introduced into the AUV design and research to improve its autonomy. However, these methods are still difficult to apply directly to the actual AUV system because of the sparse rewards and low learning efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive reinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the advantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition, since the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running in the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further propose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human rewards and environmental rewards at the same time. We test our methods in two path following tasks-straight line and sinusoids curve following of AUV by simulating in the Gazebo platform. Our experimental results show that with our proposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner from only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from both human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better performance than that with deep interactive RL and can adapt to the actual environment by further learning from environmental rewards.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970433","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976170","Autonomous underwater vehicle;interactive reinforcement learning;deep Q network;path following","Reinforcement learning;Task analysis;Robots;Oceans;Uncertainty;Neural networks;Autonomous underwater vehicles","autonomous underwater vehicles;control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);path planning;robot programming","autonomous underwater vehicle;pre-programming tasks;actual AUV system;low learning efficiency;deep interactive reinforcement learning method;human rewards;environmental reward;deep interactive RL method;AUV learning;deep RL","","4","","32","CCBY","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Safe and socially compliant motion provided by a user intention driven local motion planner is fused with user teleoperation in order to create such a system. Taking into account the fact that the user is the primary controller, our proposed system aims to provide progressive assistance whenever the user is in danger of collision or at risk of disturbance to other humans. We also thus propose generalized formulations for estimating user intentions and for sharing control within the context of wheelchair mobility assistance, that is adaptable in order to be deployed in real world systems.

A resulting demand for more generally accessible communication interfaces has motivated several recent independent research efforts focused on providing robotic systems with a robust natural language interface. Natural language interfaces enable intuitive interaction for untrained and non-expert users. However, achieving real-time performance is particularly challenging, yet essential, to enable flexible, efficient communication. The length of the language input directly impacts the run-time performance and quickly becomes a practical issue when the input is a sequence of multiple sentences, or a monologue. In this work, we propose a variant of a contemporary probabilistic graphical model for language understanding that introduces novel segmentation of the input into a sequence of sentences to be labeled in order. We introduce the notion of a continuously updated prior context that retains the meaning of previous sentences as the inference process proceeds. This prior context serves as evidence during future sentence evaluations. We evaluate our model on two natural language corpora, and demonstrate its utility on a Clearpath Husky A200 mobile manipulator and a simulated Rethink Robotics Baxter Robot.","1944-9437","978-1-5386-3518-6","10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172349","","Grounding;Natural languages;Robot kinematics;Semantics;Pragmatics","graph theory;intelligent robots;interactive systems;mobile robots;natural language interfaces","independent research efforts;accessible communication interfaces;monologic natural language instruction understanding;continuously updated prior context;contemporary probabilistic graphical model;multiple sentences;run-time performance;language input;flexible communication;real-time performance;nonexpert users;intuitive interaction;natural language interfaces;robust natural language interface;robotic systems;autonomous robots;contextual awareness;simulated Rethink Robotics Baxter Robot;natural language corpora;future sentence evaluations","","","","26","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the performance of the age estimation is greatly affected by the aging feature, the aging feature extraction from facial images is very important. The aging features used in previous works can be divided into global and local features. As global features, Active Appearance Models (AAM) was mainly used for age estimation in previous works. However, AAM is not enough to represent local features such as wrinkle and skin. Therefore, the research about local features is required. In previous works, local features were generally used to determine age group rather than detailed age, and the comparative studies about various local features extraction methods were not conducted. In this paper, the performances of sobel filter, difference image between original and smoothed image, ideal high pass filter (IHPF), gaussian high pass filter (GHPF), Haar and Daubechies discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are compared for extracting local features and detailed age estimation is performed by Support Vector Regression (SVR) on BERC and PAL aging database.

In addition, this system will be powered using machine learning algorithms with the help of a publicly available repository of over five million games. This will make the user feel like he/she is playing against another human and not a machine. The existing chess systems use a variety of algorithms in order to choose its move. Most of these use tree traversals and the most common one is the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Min-max algorithm finds the best move, and alpha-beta pruning prevents it from going into branches of the game tree that cannot yield a better result than previously traversed branches. Since the tree generated in a chess game is very deep and have a lot nodes, these algorithms examine the depth only to a certain amount. Generally, these algorithms are accompanied by an opening repository which bolsters the algorithm's efficiency. Since these algorithms are too strong for a visually impaired individual, a new approach is suggested to choose the computer's move. A publicly available repository of over five million chess games played by humans will be used to train the machine, initially. When the user makes his/her move, it will be converted into text and given as input to both the Minimax and the k-NN algorithms. The moves given as output by both these algorithms are compared using an evaluation function. The move with a higher score is chosen. The game continues till a decisive result is obtained.","","978-1-5386-1887-5","10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8389758","Speech Recognition;Hidden Markov Model;Minimax model;Alpha-beta pruning;k-nearest neighbour","Games;Speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Training;Data analysis;Engines","computer games;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;speech recognition;trees (mathematics)","chess game;visually impaired individual;k-NN algorithms;speech recognition based chess system;visual chess simulators;voice commands;min-max algorithm;alpha-beta pruning;game tree;machine learning algorithms;tree traversals","","","","9","","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, in order to evaluate the preferences toward using RSS into ubiquitous learning environment, student satisfaction is also assessed. Experimental results revealed that ubiquitous learning system by using RSS can greatly promote instructor-learners interaction and learners participation in curriculum activities but have no influence in learners cognition and metacognition.

We have created a new teaching tool, ""Automata Simulator"", which is meant to help students in faster and better comprehension of the basics of automata theory that pose the greatest problem in understanding state machines in general. The student is given the freedom to design an arbitrary state machine by using an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and operate it by interactively controlling the tool.

Therefore, this paper proposes to inspire creativity in e-learning called the virtual interactive classroom by using RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) which is a sophisticated TCP-based real-time networking protocol which supports the efficient exchange of messages, synchronized data, audio, and video. Teachers and students can publish streaming audio, video and other data messages to present streaming media with interaction or navigation. Using this virtual classroom on the internet, students can immediately interact with teachers as though they were studying in a real classroom. In addition to the virtual interactive classroom, this article also proposes using web-based collaborative work as an add-on feature to the learning system. Both teacher and student can use web-based collaborative work for sharing resources and exchanging ideas after the class. The integration of the two concepts of the virtual interactive classroom and web-based collaborative work in order to enhance teaching and learning performance has been created.","2165-9567","978-1-4244-6571-2","10.1109/EDUCON.2010.5492344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492344","learning system;virtual interactive classroom;web-based collaborative work;Wikis","Learning systems;Collaborative work;Electronic learning;Protocols;Streaming media;Web page design;Collaboration;Navigation;Internet;Education","computer aided instruction;groupware;Internet;transport protocols;virtual reality","e-learning;virtual interactive classroom;real-time messaging protocol;TCP;networking protocol;Internet;web-based collaborative work;learning system","","8","4","25","","24 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We designed ADAPT in accordance with current training guidelines for stroke rehabilitation; ADAPT engages the patient intensively, actively, and adaptively in a variety of realistic functional tasks that require reaching and manipulation. A general-purpose robot simulates the dynamics of the functional tasks and presents these functional tasks to the patient. A novel tool-changing system enables ADAPT to automatically switch between the tools corresponding to the functional tasks. The control architecture of ADAPT is composed of three main components: a high-level task scheduler, a functional task model, and a low-level admittance controller. The high-level task scheduler adaptively selects the task to practice and sets the task difficulty based on the previous performance of the patients. The functional task model generates desired trajectories based on learned models of task dynamics. Tasks dynamics are modeled with receptive field weighted regression (RFWR), such that the feel of the task tools is accurately modeled, and the task difficulty can be easily adjusted. The low-level admittance controller, which is also learned with RFWR, implements the selected task trajectory for robot-patient interaction. The results of a preliminary experiment with a healthy subject demonstrate the successful operation of ADAPT.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2009.2019787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967899","Admittance controller;locally weighted learning;motor schedule;neurorehabilitation;rehabilitation robotics;stroke;upper extremity","Rehabilitation robotics;Robotics and automation;Extremities;Medical treatment;Switches;Automatic control;Admittance;Computer science;Medical robotics;Adaptive systems","diseases;electric variables control;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;regression analysis","adaptive automated robotic task-practice system;arm functions;adaptive and automatic presentation of tasks;upper extremity function;ADAPT;stroke rehabilitation;tool-changing system;low-level admittance controller;functional task model;high-level task scheduler;task dynamics;receptive field weighted regression;robot-patient interaction","","23","","54","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the extension of the proposed virtual fixture algorithm for passive and non-passive environments is also discussed. This task is feasible by use of a force sensor that measures environment force. Stability analysis of switching modes of virtual fixtures is shown by a unique Lyapunov function. Finally, simulation results on a surgical maxillofacial robot is presented which verifies the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4673-8704-0","10.1109/ICCIAutom.2016.7483128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483128","Virtual fixtures;stiffness matrix;impedance control;screw theory;switching control","Robots;Springs;Fasteners;Impedance;Stability analysis;Matrix decomposition;Mathematical model","end effectors;force sensors;human-robot interaction;Lyapunov methods;medical robotics;stability;surgery","impedance control;screw stiffness matrix;virtual fixture stiffness matrix;screw theory;force sensor;stability analysis;Lyapunov function;surgical maxillofacial robot;end effector","","","","17","","2 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, significant emphasis has been placed on focus+context (F+C) techniques (e.g., fisheye views and magnification lens) for data exploration in addition to viewing transformation and hierarchical navigation. However, most of the existing data exploration techniques rely on the manipulation of viewing attributes of the rendering system or optical attributes of the data objects, with users being passive viewers. In this paper, we propose a more active approach to data exploration, which attempts to mimic how we would explore data if we were able to hold it and interact with it in our hands. This involves allowing the users to physically or actively manipulate the geometry of a data object. While this approach has been traditionally used in applications, such as surgical simulation, where the original geometry of the data objects is well understood by the users, there are several challenges when this approach is generalized for applications, such as flow and information visualization, where there is no common perception as to the normal or natural geometry of a data object. We introduce a taxonomy and a set of transformations especially for illustrative deformation of general data exploration. We present combined geometric or optical illustration operators for focus+context visualization, and examine the best means for preventing the deformed context from being misperceived. We demonstrated the feasibility of this generalization with examples of flow, information and video visualization.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376157","Volume deformation;focus+context visualization;interaction techniques","Data visualization;Focusing;Cognitive science;Silver;Surgery;Information geometry;Geometrical optics;Taxonomy;Lenses;Navigation","computational geometry;data visualisation;interactive systems;rendering (computer graphics)","data exploration;information visualization;data rendering quality;focus+context techniques;data manipulation;data object geometry;interaction techniques","","25","1","31","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there has not been any systematic evaluation of the accuracy of this claim. On the face of it, there are several ways a proactive robot assistant can in fact reduce the effectiveness of teaming. For example, it can increase the cognitive load of the human teammate by performing actions that are unanticipated by the human. In such cases, even though the teaming performance could be improved, it is unclear whether humans are willing to adapt to robot actions or are able to adapt in a timely manner. Furthermore, misinterpretations and delays in goal and intent recognition due to partial observations and limited communication can also reduce the performance. In this paper, our aim is to perform an analysis of human factors on the effectiveness of such proactive support in human-robot teaming. We perform our evaluation in a simulated Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, in which the efficacy of teaming is not only dependent on individual performance but also on teammates' interactions with each other. In this task, the human teammate is remotely controlling a robot while working with an intelligent robot teammate `Mary'. Our main result shows that the subjects generally preferred Mary with the ability to provide proactive support (compared to Mary without this ability). Our results also show that human cognitive load was increased with a proactive assistant (albeit not significantly) even though the subjects appeared to interact with it less.","","978-1-4799-9994-1","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353878","","Intelligent robots;Planning;Human factors;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Systematics","emergency management;human-robot interaction;rescue robots","intelligent robot teammate Mary;human cognitive load;USAR task;simulated urban search and rescue;intent recognition;robot actions;human teammate;proactive robot assistant;assistive robots;human-robot teaming;proactive support;human factors analysis","","9","","25","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, much potential of this data remains unexploited due to inherent complexity of manipulating such information, which bars the majority of users benefiting from this. One potential application is the detection of anomalies by users from a non-technical background through definition of rules. As such, a methodology/framework, which could enable users to define rules/query information from sensors fused with other contextual data in a user-friendly manner would be highly useful in deriving value from this data. This research attempts to formulate a low-cost framework, which enables users without a strong technical background to make potential use of this. The research is performed using a case study; identification of anomalies in the behaviours and violations of rules by marine vessels in Sri Lankan waters. However, the framework is generalized to enable application to other contexts also. The framework also attempts to identify a possible method and a process to enable users enter geo spatial rules in an accurate as well as user friendly manner while allowing to enter rules of different levels of complexities accurately. The research attempts to solve this problem through the use of a map interface which enables users enter geo spatial data either plotting on a screen or as pairs of coordinates. Use of auto query forms with dynamically changing queries was proposed to enter conditions of rules and the interrelationships. The research was carried out using one prototype and two systems in three stages, using the input of one step to next. Both methods of spatial rule entry were deemed accepted by users considering the ease of use in direct plotting as well as accuracy in formal coordinate entry in the two methods. While auto query form was found as a suitable method with reasonable accuracy with accuracy increasing with the educational background of users and decreasing on several occasions with increased complexity (multiple conditions or ambiguity of underlying concept) of rules, the display of the rule query in user readable form at the bottom of the interface as well as enabling the user to dynamically view query results to refine the query showed increased accuracy.","2472-7598","978-1-5386-2444-9","10.1109/ICTER.2017.8257798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257798","contextual anomaly identification;dynamic query;query form;geospatial data;wireless sensors","Artificial intelligence;Databases;Anomaly detection;Temperature sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Mobile handsets","computational complexity;decision making;Global Positioning System;human computer interaction;query processing;security of data;sensor fusion","contextual data;user-friendly manner;low-cost framework;geo spatial rules;user friendly manner;geo spatial data;auto query form;spatial rule entry;increased complexity;rule query;user readable form;nontechnical users;wireless sensors;technological innovation;sensor data;anomaly detection;mobile devices;wearable devices;spatio-temporal data;rules/query information;inherent complexity;decision making;GPS location","","","","36","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most GUIs do not have a fixed layout, but are resizable and able to adapt themselves. Constraints are a powerful tool for specifying adaptable GUI layouts: they are used to specify a layout in a general form, and a constraint solver is used to find a satisfying concrete layout, e.g. for a specific GUI size. The constraint solver has to calculate a new layout every time a GUI is resized or changed, so it needs to be efficient to ensure a good user experience. One approach for constraint solvers is based on the Gauss-Seidel algorithm and successive over-relaxation (SOR). Our observation is that a solution after resizing or changing is similar in structure to a previous solution. Thus, our hypothesis is that we can increase the computational performance of an SOR-based constraint solver if we reuse the solution of a previous layout to warm-start the solving of a new layout. In this paper we report on experiments to test this hypothesis experimentally for three common use cases: big-step resizing, small-step resizing and constraint change. In our experiments, we measured the solving time for randomly generated GUI layout specifications of various sizes. For all three cases we found that the performance is improved if an existing solution is used as a starting solution for a new layout.","","978-1-4799-0615-4","10.1109/ICDIM.2013.6693970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693970","UI layout;warm start;successive over-relaxation","Graphical user interfaces;Layout;Iterative methods;Runtime;Numerical models;Equations;Linear matrix inequalities","Gaussian processes;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction","SOR solvers;constraint-based GUI;warm-start strategy;computer programs;graphical user interfaces;constraint solver;user experience;Gauss-Seidel algorithm;successive over-relaxation;big-step resizing;small-step resizing;constraint change;GUI layout specifications","","1","","24","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on a formal multidimensional model using an algebraic representation of emotional states. This multidimensional model provides to represent infinity of emotions and provide powerful mathematical tools for the analysis and the processing of these emotions. It permits to estimate the human emotional state through combining information from different modalities (e.g. facial expressions, speech, body postures and gestures, etc) in order to allow more reliable estimation of emotional states. Our proposal permits to recognize not only the basic emotions (e.g., anger, sadness, fear) but also different types of complex emotions like simulated and masked emotions.

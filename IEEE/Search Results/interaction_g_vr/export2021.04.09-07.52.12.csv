"Coding for interactive communication","L. J. Schulman","Div. of Comput. Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","6 Aug 2002","1996","42","6","1745","1756","Let the input to a computation problem be split between two processors connected by a communication link; and let an interactive protocol /spl pi/ be known by which, on any input, the processors can solve the problem using no more than T transmissions of bits between them, provided the channel is noiseless in each direction. We study the following question: if in fact the channel is noisy, what is the effect upon the number of transmissions needed in order to solve the computation problem reliably? Technologically this concern is motivated by the increasing importance of communication as a resource in computing, and by the tradeoff in communications equipment between bandwidth, reliability, and expense. We treat a model with random channel noise. We describe a deterministic method for simulating noiseless-channel protocols on noisy channels, with only a constant slowdown. This is an analog for general, interactive protocols of Shannon's coding theorem, which deals only with data transmission, i.e., one-way protocols. We cannot use Shannon's block coding method because the bits exchanged in the protocol are determined only one at a time, dynamically, in the course of the interaction. Instead, we describe a simulation protocol using a new kind of code, explicit tree codes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.556671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=556671","","Protocols;Computational modeling;Data communication;Error probability;Signal to noise ratio;Communication equipment;Bandwidth;Block codes;Distributed computing;Reliability theory","random noise;interactive systems;telecommunication channels;channel coding;protocols;information theory","interactive communication;communication link;interactive protocol;computation problem;bandwidth;reliability;expense;random channel noise;deterministic method;noiseless-channel protocols;noisy channels;Shannon's coding theorem;data transmission;simulation protocol;explicit tree codes","","90","2","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Semantics-based software techniques for maintainable multimodal input processing in real-time interactive systems","M. Fischbach; D. Wiebusch; M. E.

Its fulfilment is already challenging for low-interactive application areas. It is additionally complicated by complex system designs of Real-time Interactive Systems (RISs), required for Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality, as well as computer games. If such systems incorporate AI methods, as required for the implementation of multimodal interfaces or smart environments, it is even further exacerbated. Existing approaches strive to establish software technical solutions to support the close temporal and semantic coupling required for multimodal processing and at the same time preserve a general decoupling principle between involved software modules. We present two key solutions that target the semantic coupling issue: (1) a semantics-based access scheme to principal elements of the application state and (2) the specification of effects by means of semantic function descriptions for multimodal processing. Both concepts are modeled in an OWL ontology. The applicability of our concepts is showcased by a prototypical implementation and explained by an interaction example that is applied for two application areas.","2328-7829","978-1-5090-4275-3","10.1109/SEARIS.2016.7551582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551582","D.2.11 [Software Engineering]: Software Architectures—;H.5.2 [Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces","Semantics;Couplings;Green products;Software;OWL;Ontologies;Interactive systems","interactive systems;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);software quality;software reusability","semantics-based software techniques;maintainable multimodal input processing;real-time interactive systems;RISs;software reusability;software modifiability;software modularity;nonfunctional software quality requirement;AI methods;multimodal interfaces;temporal coupling;semantic coupling;semantics-based access scheme;semantic function descriptions;OWL ontology","","2","","29","","29 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation results indicate that the automated helicopter trainer is capable of performing the hover maneuvers. To verify the concept of the automated trainer, a simple one axis manual control cart-pole system was used. Two groups of four students each were used in the experiment with one being the experimental group which was trained with the automated trainer, and the other being the control group which was trained with no automated trainer. The experimental results show that the automated manual trainer did not ""mess up"" the training process, but no further conclusions can be drawn since the experimental group is too small to generalize the results.

"Design of open source platform for automatic control systems education based on cooperative learning","J. Á. Ariza","Uniminuto, Dept of electronic technology, Bogotá, Colombia","2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","1 Dec 2016","2016","","","1","9","This paper exposes the design of a platform for the learning of control systems based upon collaborative efforts of the students in this area. The context of this platform arises according to some general educative and technical elements. The first element is to help to the technical processes that the students follow in the design of digital controllers in the automatic control area, e.g., modeling, simulation, evaluation and debug. The second element is focused on the development of a novel open source platform for automatic control, whose aim is to help to improve the educational process of the students in this area. The educational concept of the platform is based on cooperative learning methodology, in which the students collaborate with the platform design according to their needs and expectations. This methodology allowed to know initially the points of view of the students with the aim to establish the perspectives, motivations, skills and weaknesses of them in the automatic control area as well as in the different technical subareas needed in the design of the platform such as programming or signal conditioning. In agreement with the cooperative learning methodology, the construction of the platform was divided in small tasks with objectives clearly defined associated to the learning of the different educational contents in the components of hardware and software needed in the design of it. Our students interacted with each other, sharing common issues and difficulties associated with the technical behavior of the platform. This process increased the group motivation so as to find common aims both technical and human as likewise it encouraged the creativity in search of technical solutions in the design of the platform. The previous steps guarantee the principal concept of the cooperative learning methodology defined as positive interdependence, which is associated to how the student learns the different theoretical and practical educational contents and how this helps to the other group-mates to learn these contents through of the interaction with them.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757605","Cooperative learning;educational methodology;reflection;metacognitive;platform;open source;control system design","Graphical user interfaces;Debugging;Control systems","computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;digital control;public domain software","open source platform design;automatic control systems education;control system learning;collaborative efforts;general educative element;technical element;digital controller design;automatic control area;cooperative learning methodology;programming;signal conditioning","","1","","25","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current experiment examined the influence of dynamic frequency information on the associated perceptions of simple geometric features. Participants were presented with short durations of vibrotactile stimulation to their fingertip across an array of oscillating pins. A pair of frequencies was used to simulate simple tactile edges across the array surface. Over a relatively short `shift' duration, the frequencies at which these regions vibrated often switched spatial locations. Participants were required to indicate which of three possible shapes (left edge, right edge, or none) they experienced. The results were consistent with a predictive model of perceptual decision making in that responses were generally biased by the initial rather than the final configuration. Further, performance accuracy was maximized at the intermediate, 500-ms shift duration for a 10-158 Hz frequency pairing. This indicated that performance may be enhanced when larger frequency differences are used in concert with shift durations consistent with natural, exploratory movements.","2324-7355","978-1-7281-0234-4","10.1109/HAPTICS45997.2020.ras.HAP20.9.699b3778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086299","Predictive Perception;Vibrotactile Perception","","decision making;haptic interfaces;neurophysiology;tactile sensors;touch (physiological);user experience;vibrations;visual perception","predictive perception;fingertip;sensory predictions;dynamic frequency information;vibrotactile stimulation;oscillating pins;array surface;spatial locations;left edge;predictive model;perceptual decision making;shift duration;frequency differences;shift durations;natural movements;exploratory movements;frequency pairing;tactile edges;dynamic vibrotactile stimuli;frequency 10.0 Hz to 158.0 Hz;time 500 ms","","","","18","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In computer-based environments, where learners interact only with a computer and do not have access to direct support from a teacher, learners need to be provided with instructional prompts or just-in-time help intended to encourage more active example processing during learning. This study investigated whether it was more beneficial to provide the learners access to on-demand (self-regulated) help after they committed an error in problem solving or for the learning environment to regulate the presentation of instructional help externally. Furthermore, two different presentational formats-textual and pictorial-of instructional prompts were examined. This study was conducted with a computer-based learning environment that introduced high school students without any prior content-specific knowledge to the principles of parallel and series circuit analysis. Textual prompts facilitated practice problem solving notably better than pictorial prompts. Overall, textual-based prompts produced a large effect on near transfer. A significant format of prompts by academic ability interaction was discovered on near transfer. In particular, lower-ability learners scored significantly better when given textual prompts; whereas, their higher-ability counterparts performed equally well with both formats. Moreover, learners provided with externally regulated prompts reported significantly more positive attitudes toward the prompts in general compared to learners in the self-regulated conditions. Finally, continuous motivation was significantly stronger in learners who viewed textual prompts than in their counterparts in the pictorial prompt groups.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2005.852602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495662","Backward fading;computer-based learning environment;electrical circuit analysis;external control;high school;instructional prompts;learner control;pictorial format;textual format","Electronics engineering education;Circuit simulation;Computer aided instruction","electronic engineering education;circuit analysis computing;computer aided instruction","instructional prompts;electrical circuit analysis;computer-based learning environment;high school students;parallel circuit analysis;series circuit analysis;textual prompts;pictorial prompts","","15","","21","","15 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The flow of information in a Web personalization system can be prone to significant amounts of error and uncertainty. This uncertainty pervades all stages from the user's Web navigation patterns to the final recommendations, including the intermediate stages of logging Web usage, preprocessing and segmenting Web log data into Web user sessions, clustering these sessions, and computing Web user profiles from these clusters. Fuzzy approximate reasoning can offer a general framework for the, recommendation process. It is this framework that is investigated in this paper.

Often, the data specifications required by the interfaces are implicitly available within the mathematical models. Moreover, control and optimization schemes sometimes require data to be transferred to be able to operate. Despite these synergies, these tasks are generally treated separately. In this work, we aim to reduce the gap between those activities to facilitate the development of interactive and collaborative systems. We model a system consisting of multiple buildings and multiple energy networks to optimize their operation. We work with the model in a follow up step to create an industrially applicable interface that relies on the OPC UA communication protocol, which is widely used in industry and is easily integrated in modern SCADA systems.

Apprentice surgeons commonly suffer from suture breakage or knot failure. The difficulty, generally, comes from the absence of feedback of interaction force cues in a medical device (e.g., a needle and a thread). Even if there is haptic feedback to the operator, the operator may have a difficulty to detect a specific force such as suture breakage force. To deal with this problem, we propose a control method which can detect a suture breakage force more sensitively by considering human perception characteristics. A performance objective of the control method is designed according to the human perceptual factor, just noticeable difference.

A 2-D FE model combined with Augmented Lagrange algorithm, from the physiological characteristics of fingerpad, is developed to simulate the interactions between fingerpad and compliant plates with finite thickness, and attempts are made to develop an analytical models of total contact force versus indentation, or contact-area radius, and spatial distribution profiles of contact pressure, respectively. It is demonstrated that the exponential law is more approximate than the power law in describing the compressive stress-strain behaviors of soft tissues within fingertip in the case of human fingerpad against planar objects. However, in the case of contact force versus contact-area radius, the power law is more suitable. In addition, the study indicates that the contact pressure decays following an exponential law away from the contact center.

This work enhances state-of-the-art neural style transfer techniques by a generalized user interface with interactive tools to facilitate a creative and localized editing process. Thereby, we first propose a problem characterization representing trade-offs between visual quality, run-time performance, and user control. We then present MaeSTrO, a mobile app for orchestration of neural style transfer techniques using iterative, multi-style generative and adaptive neural networks that can be locally controlled by on-screen painting metaphors.

Recent researches show that the fine-grained sentiment analysis for aspect-level has become a research hotspot. However, previous work did not consider the influence of grammatical rules on aspect-level sentiment analysis. In addition, attention mechanism is too simple to learn attention information from context and target interactively. Therefore, we propose an interactive rule attention network (IRAN) for aspect-level sentiment analysis. IRAN not only designs a grammar rule encoder, which simulates the grammatical functions at the sentence by standardizing the output of adjacent positions, but also constructs an interaction attention network to learn attention information from context and target. Experimental results on SemEval 2014 Dataset and ACL 2014 Twitter Dataset demonstrate IRAN can learn effective features and obtain superior performance over the baseline models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2981139","National Science Foundation; Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Shandong Provincial Social Science Planning Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9037260","Aspect-level sentiment analysis;grammatical rules;IRAN;interaction attention network","Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Task analysis;Grammar;Social sciences;Twitter","data mining;grammars;interactive systems;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sentiment analysis","attention information;interactive rule attention network;aspect-level sentiment analysis;fine-grained sentiment analysis;NLP;IRAN;grammar rule encoder;grammatical functions;SemEval 2014 Dataset;ACL 2014 Twitter Dataset","","4","","45","CCBY","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While there are guidelines for identifying the best teaching style for material, new and evolving areas can present unique challenges. The emerging area of mobile software development, which combines aspects of software, hardware, and interpersonal interaction, captures many such challenges; e.g., understanding how to develop for multiple screen sizes, designing for GPS time lag, dealing with unreliable sensor data. Teaching these challenging materials seemed well suited for multiple approaches that leveraged different learning styles. This paper examines three teaching approaches employed in ten teaching modules across two semesters of a mobile software development course. The approaches included lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming. Lectures were used to introduce topics and explore underlying theories of development. The lectures included time for questions from and for the students, but otherwise did not have an active learning component. Two active learning approaches used in the class were interactive tutorials and Pair Programming. Interactive tutorials presented applied development approaches, then explored their use in an individual-based hands-on demos. Pair Programming is an agile software development practice, used in both industry and education, which enforces a role-based approach to learning new programming concepts. Homeworks were used to assess learning, and surveys reflected student satisfaction. Results show areas of promise and of concern with regard to the learning styles. It seems that repetition of topics is important for mastery of the topics. Foundational theories seem well suited for lectures, while programming concepts work better in active learning situations. Additional learning took place through office hours, online question forums, and individual and group online exploration. The findings suggest specific approaches to teaching challenging and unique mobile software development topics as well as a general approach to identifying ways to distribute learning objectives across lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming sessions.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757533","Mobile Application Development;Computer Science Education;Pair Programming","Mobile communication;Programming profession;Tutorials;Software;Springs","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;mobile computing;software engineering;teaching","teaching mobile application development;lectures;interactive tutorials;teaching styles;learning process;hardware;interpersonal interaction;GPS time lag;unreliable sensor data;learning styles;teaching modules;mobile software development course;active learning component;individual-based hands-on demos;agile software development practice;homeworks;student satisfaction;programming concepts;active learning situations;online question forums;group online exploration;mobile software development topics;distribute learning objectives;pair programming sessions","","2","","26","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are various approaches to reestablish the haptic feedback for the surgeon, including tactile displays and haptic input devices. We present a novel haptic display that features seven pins mounted on compression springs that can be pre-loaded with servo motors. Each pin has a stroke of 10 mm and a maximum counterforce of 1.1 N. An additional force of 0.7 N per pin can be applied with the motors. This technique allows for simultaneous stimulation of kinesthetic as well as tactile perception. The control of the haptic display has been implemented in the open-source haptics library CHAI 3D. We extended the framework with a multi interaction point tool to represent the hardware. This eventually lead to a palpation training program where bodies with multiple adjustable parameters encapsulated in a virtual soft tissue can be simulated. We evaluated this software in a user study with 15 participants in order to demonstrate the usability of the haptic display. With 90 % of successful hits, we are confident that sensible haptic feedback can be generated with the presented device. Furthermore, we are currently extending the scope of the haptic display to make use of a novel capacitive tactile proximity sensor in exploration scenarios.","","978-1-4673-9675-2","10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7418782","","Haptic interfaces;Force;Servomotors;Robot sensing systems;Pins;Springs;Three-dimensional displays","C++ language;display instrumentation;feedback;haptic interfaces;medical robotics;public domain software;software libraries;surgery","kinesthetic feedback;tactile feedback;CHAI 3D palpation training scenario;haptic display;compression springs;servo motors;pins;open-source haptics library;multiinteraction point tool;virtual soft tissue;robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery;C++library","","4","","22","","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The implications of manipulable inter-medium encodings for coaching and learner modelling","A. P. Parkes","Dept. of Comput., Lancaster Univ., UK","IEE Colloquium on Intelligent Tutoring Systems","6 Aug 2002","1990","","","8/1","8/3","Domains typically have associated with them some notation, or more generally, encodings formed from elements of a medium, which are used to convey information about the concepts, objects and processes of the domain. Often, entities in a domain can be communicated more directly by encodings in an alternative medium, e.g. diagrams. In some systems, the representative encoding which is available to the user (the external encoding) can be manipulated by the user in ways which are constrained to have meaning in encodings in another medium (the internal, or base medium). Such interfaces embody what is called a manipulable inter-medium encoding (MIME). The ITS implications of such systems have been investigated in studies based on a simple 'direct manipulation' graphical interface (called HUGH). The task was the proof of a theorem of context free languages by constrained exploration of derivation tree diagrams. Fifteen postgraduate researchers took part in the experiment. The HUGH system was not an ITS, but an ITS was simulated by the presence of an observer providing coaching as required. At certain points in the interaction, learners were presented with questions (and corresponding answer windows) designed to elicit their semantic accounts of the operations performed. The study indicated some ITS implications of the use of MIMEs.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=181207","","Computer aided instruction;Formal languages;Graphical user interfaces;Human factors;Knowledge based systems","computer aided instruction;context-free languages;graphical user interfaces;human factors;knowledge based systems;teaching","MIME-based learning environment;learner modelling;alternative medium;diagrams;representative encoding;external encoding;base medium;manipulable inter-medium encoding;MIME;ITS implications;direct manipulation;graphical interface;HUGH;context free languages;constrained exploration;derivation tree diagrams;postgraduate researchers;semantic accounts","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Driving simulator experiments were conducted with five secondary tasks including navigation, tuning the radio, replying to a text message, replying to a voice message, and making a phone call. Drivers' general visual and visual characteristics in the process of performing different secondary tasks were observed. An assessment method of secondary tasks based on the AttenD algorithm is proposed, and the degree of visual distraction of drivers with different experience and ages under different secondary tasks was evaluated and ranked. The results show that a significant difference exists among visual features under different secondary tasks; drivers' experience and age and secondary tasks had an interaction effect on visual features.

Such manipulators can be found in a wide range of applications (e.g. farming works, roadside maintenance, forestry applications). In general, they are controlled solely by a human operator, as the automation of such systems is too challenging due to their unstructured working environment. The work with such manipulators is often physically and psychologically demanding. In the presence of obstacles or other restrictions in the working area, haptic feedback can help to relieve the operator and increase his awareness. If the vehicle platform additionally moves during the operating process, state-of-the-art methods cannot be directly applied to generate haptic feedback. Therefore, we propose two shared-control concepts, based on potential field methods supporting the operator during his task. The first one is a modified trajectory guidance approach. The second one is a directly generated feedback approach, which does not compute a desired joystick position, but directly the haptic feedback. Both proposed methods do not need the reference trajectory of the manipulator, only the detected obstacles as a set of points. The reference trajectory is specified by the operator and is unknown to the automation. The two concepts are verified in a simple simulation environment. Finally, they are validated on a test bench, with a force-feedback joystick.","2163-5145","978-1-7281-5635-4","10.1109/ISIE45063.2020.9152208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152208","Shared-Control;Human-Machine-Interaction component;Large Vehicle-Manipulator;Force-Feedback Joystick;Potential Field","Manipulators;Haptic interfaces;Trajectory;Task analysis;Hydraulic systems;Automation","collision avoidance;control engineering computing;force feedback;haptic interfaces;interactive devices;manipulators;mobile robots;position control;telerobotics","working area;haptic feedback;vehicle platform;operating process;shared-control concepts;modified trajectory guidance approach;directly generated feedback approach;reference trajectory;manipulator;force-feedback joystick;vehicle-manipulators;human operating;forestry applications;human operator;unstructured working environment","","1","","24","","30 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

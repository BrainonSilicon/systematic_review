The cost of such a setup is such that it makes it inaccessible to most. The project aims at providing a cost effective VR solution which can produce the same effect with precision and flexibility, which is accessible to all. The proposed idea is to provide a hardware device that provides the user with an immersive VR experience and uses hand gestures captured via a camera placed on the device to control and interact with the VR environment. As an application of the project, an interactive workspace environment would be simulated, using a single hardware component that provides the user the viewing interface as well as can be controlled by simple hand gestures eliminating the need for additional hand-held devices controls. The project will also delve into the field of supervised learning to make possible the implementation of gesture recognition.","","978-1-5386-1185-2","10.1109/ICSCET.2018.8537334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537334","Virtual Reality;VR;Gesture Recognition;Sensor;Hand Gesture Controls;VOIP;File transfer;Supervised learning","Tracking;Virtual environments;Cameras;Servers;Gesture recognition;Python","gesture recognition;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);virtual reality","virtual reality;virtual environment;wireless hand controls;cost effective VR solution;hardware device;immersive VR experience;VR environment;interactive workspace environment;single hardware component;gesture recognition;hand gestures;hand-held devices controls;gesture controlled virtual reality based conferencing;supervised learning","","","","20","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advantages of the HMD include interacting with the simulation in a more natural manner as compared to using a large-screen immersive display due to the similarities between the interactions afforded in the virtual compared to the real-world task. Suspending the laws of physics may have an effect on usability and in turn could affect learning outcomes. Our dependent variables consisted of a pre and post cognition questionnaire, quantitative performance measures, perceived workload and system usefulness, and a psychomotor assessment to measure to what extent transfer of learning took place from the virtual to the real world.

"Creating tangible cultural learning opportunities for indigenous dance with motion detecting technologies","M. Khan; P. de Byl","School of Communication, Northwestern University in Qatar; Multimedia and Games, School of Communication & Media, Bond University, Australia","2012 IEEE International Games Innovation Conference","15 Oct 2012","2012","","","1","3","Witnessing and imitating a dance instructor facilitates improved learning opportunities compared with textual, auditory or video reproductions. Learning a complex dance from a verbal description is difficult, as spoken words are slow and cannot encapsulate all the details of a precise maneuver. Unfortunately, in a museum environment, visitors are not afforded the opportunity to become fully immersed in ancient and endangered forms of dance with a live instructor because having instructions inside the museum is not logistically feasible. Instead prerecorded video or paper-based images and notes are presented for perusal. This neither assists in the communication of the importance of this type of cultural heritage nor preserves the performances by passing on skills to future generations. The lack of knowledge transfer in this domain means each year many indigenous dances and their particular movements are lost in time as they become irrelevant and no longer practiced. This is a disgrace as cultural dance represents an expression, social interaction and sometime spiritual representation of a feeling or even an historical narrative in some cultures. It is an important part in understanding a culture, as much as the tangible that remains so highly soughtout by archeologists, yet dance, like other Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), without human practice, cannot be preserved in the same manner. To address this issue, we propose herein a system using motion-sensing and gaming technology that can assist in the preservation and knowledge transfer of indigenous dances. GLIDE is an application based on motion detecting technology that targets children in a heritage-related environment in order to create awareness about indigenous dance movements. It will offer kinesthetic clarity and playfulness in a domain very much dominated by flat, non-interactive video content.","2166-675X","978-1-4673-1358-2","10.1109/IGIC.2012.6329834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6329834","Heritage;Serious Gaming;Museum Technologie;Augmented Reality;Motion detecting Technologies","Cultural differences;Games;Prototypes;Educational institutions;Knowledge transfer;Humans;Motion segmentation","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;humanities","tangible cultural learning;indigenous dance;motion detecting technology;museum environment;cultural heritage;knowledge transfer;cultural dance;social interaction;intangible cultural heritage;ICH;motion-sensing technology;gaming technology;GLIDE;heritage-related environment","","3","","15","","15 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At some point children will attempt to cross a road unsupervised, at that point in time their safety depends on the effectiveness of their road safety education. To date, various attempts to supplement road safety education with technology were made. Most common approach focus on addressing declarative knowledge, by delivering road safety theory in an engaging fashion. Apart from expanding on text based resources to include instructional videos and animations, some stakeholders (e.g.: Irish Road Safety Authority) attempt to take advantage of game-based learning [1]. However, despite the high capacity for interaction being common in Virtual Environments, available game-based solutions to road safety education are currently limited to delivering and assessing declarative knowledge. With recent advancements in the field of Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Displays, procedural knowledge might also be addressed in Virtual Environments. This paper describes the design and development process of a computer-supported learning system that attempts to address psycho-motor skills involved in crossing a road safely, changing learners' attitude towards road safety best practices, and enabling independent practice of transferable skills. By implementing game-based learning principles and following best practice for serious game design (such as making educational components essential to successful game-play, or instructional scaffolding) we hope to make it not only more effective, but also engaging, allowing us to rely on learners' intrinsic motivation [2], to increase their independent practice time and provide them with feedback that will help to condition safe behaviour and increase retention. Presence in Virtual Reality might evoke responses to Virtual Environment as if it was real (RAIR) [3] and enable learners to truly experience learning scenarios. In consequence leading to formation of autobiographical memories constructed from multisensory input, which should result in an increased knowledge retention and transfer [4].","","978-1-5386-6304-2","10.1109/GEM.2018.8516493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8516493","Virtual Reality;VR;Road Safety;Serious Game;Experiential Learning;Game-Based Learning;Virtual Environment","Games;Road safety;Virtual environments;Training","computer aided instruction;helmet mounted displays;road safety;serious games (computing);virtual reality","road safety education;declarative knowledge;road safety theory;road safety best practices;serious game design;virtual reality serious game;virtual environment;virtual reality head mounted displays;Woodlands;game-based learning","","4","","34","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Participants were asked to learn the location of a virtual object in a virtual environment (VE). After a short period of time they were asked to recall the location by placing a real version of the object in the real-world equivalent environment. Results indicate that the average placement error, or distance between original and recalled object location, is approximately 20cm for all locomotion technique conditions. This result is similar to the outcome of a previous study on spatial memory in VEs that used real walking.

In the studied model, small base stations (SBSs) with limited computational resources act as VR control centers that collect the tracking information from VR users over the cellular uplink and send them to the VR users over the downlink. In such a setting, VR users may send or request correlated or similar data (panoramic images and tracking data). This potential spatial data correlation can be factored into the resource allocation problem to reduce the traffic load in both uplink and downlink. This VR resource allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that allows jointly optimizing the computational and spectrum resources, while being cognizant of the data correlation. To solve this game, a transfer learning algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning algorithms that must be executed each time the environment changes, the proposed algorithm can intelligently transfer information on the learned utility, across time, to rapidly adapt to environmental dynamics due to factors such as changes in the users' content or data correlation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 16.7% and 18.2% gains in terms of delay compared to the Q-learning with data correlation and Q-learning without data correlation. The results also show that the proposed algorithm has a faster convergence time than Q-learning and can guarantee low delays.","2576-2303","978-1-5386-1823-3","10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8335683","","Correlation;Uplink;Delays;Wireless communication;Downlink;Resource management;Games","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;virtual reality","panoramic images;tracking data;potential spatial data correlation;VR resource allocation problem;computational spectrum resources;transfer learning algorithm;echo state networks;conventional reinforcement learning algorithms;echo state transfer learning;data correlation aware resource allocation;wireless virtual reality;data correlation-aware resource management;computational resources;VR control centers;VR users;similar data","","4","","12","","16 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when developing tools for rehabilitation, it is essential to design interventions that will be most effective for generalizing to the real world. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors facilitate transfer from HMD-VR to non-HMD-VR environments. Here we used a well-established test of skilled motor learning, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), to train healthy individuals in an HMD-VR environment. We examined whether learned motor skills transferred to a more conventional (non-HMD-VR) environment and what factors facilitated transfer. Our results suggest that on average, learned motor skills from this task transfer from an immersive virtual environment to a conventional environment; however, some individuals did not transfer the learned motor skills. We then examined individual differences between those that did show transfer and those that did not. We found that individuals who had previous exposure to HMD-VR were more likely to transfer their learned motor skills than those who did not. Individual differences in previous exposure to HMD-VR environments prior to training may serve as a predictor to whether learned motor skills will transfer out of HMD-VR.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994345","head-mounted virtual reality;skilled motor learning;transfer","","biomechanics;helmet mounted displays;learning (artificial intelligence);patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","HMD-VR environment;learned motor skills;head-mounted virtual reality;HMD-VR motor skills;motor rehabilitation;nonHMD-VR environments;skilled motor learning;immersive virtual environment","","","","9","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How does the number of degrees of freedom enhance or hinder the learning process? Does the increase in dimensional symmetry affect cognitive load? In an empirical evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of a natural 6-DOF interaction metaphor to a simplified 3-DOF metaphor. Our simulation interactively educates users in the step-by-step process of taking a precise measurement using calipers and micrometers in a simulated technical workbench environment. We conducted a usability study to evaluate the user experience and pedagogical benefits using measures including a pre and post cognition questionnaire over all levels of Bloom's taxonomy, workload assessment, system usability, and real world psychomotor assessment tasks. Results from the pre and post cognition questionnaires suggest that learning outcomes improved throughout all levels of Bloom's taxonomy for both conditions, and trends in the data suggest that the 6-DOF metaphor was more effective in real-world skill transference compared to the 3-DOF metaphor.","2375-5334","978-1-4799-1727-3","10.1109/VR.2015.7223317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7223317","Bimanual interaction;psychomotor skills education;dimensional symmetry","Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Instruments;Training;Metrology;Solid modeling","computer aided instruction;user interfaces;virtual reality","dimensional symmetry role;bimanual psychomotor skills education;immersive virtual environment;virtual reality applications;education application;training application;virtual simulation;learning process;cognitive load;natural 6-DOF interaction;degrees-of-freedom;calipers;micrometers;user experience;pedagogical benefits;psychomotor assessment tasks;Bloom taxonomy;bimanual dexterous activities","","9","","27","","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research compares virtual bimanual haptic training versus traditional physical training and the effectiveness for learning transfer. In a mixed experimental design, participants were assigned to either virtual or physical training and trained by assembling a wooden burr puzzle as many times as possible during a twenty minute time period. After training, participants were tested using the physical puzzle and were retested again after two weeks. All participants were trained using brightly colored puzzle pieces. To examine the effect of color, testing involved the assembly of colored physical parts and natural wood colored physical pieces. Spatial ability as measured using a mental rotation test, was shown to correlate with the number of assemblies they were able to complete in the training. While physical training outperformed virtual training, after two weeks the virtually trained participants actually improved their test assembly times. The results suggest that the color of the puzzle pieces helped the virtually trained participants in remembering the assembly process.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2393871","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014246","learning transfer;haptics;assembly;Learning transfer;Haptics;virtual reality;assembly;training","Training;Assembly;Virtual environments;Color;Haptic interfaces;Testing;Educational institutions","computer based training;virtual reality","virtual training;learning transfer;assembly tasks;assembly worker training;virtual reality;virtual bimanual haptic training;physical training;wooden burr puzzle;physical puzzle;colored physical parts;natural wood colored physical pieces;spatial ability;mental rotation;puzzle pieces;virtually trained participants;assembly process","","34","","56","","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then measured the ability of the visitors to remember the appearance of the paintings after 24 hours, as well as their ability to objectify the paintings. Experiment results show that while AR does improve retention and transfer of such art information, the benefits of AR are mediated by other factors such as interference from other elements of the exhibition, as well as subjects' own prior art experience and training. The use of AR may also produce unexpected benefits, such as providing users with a new perspective of the artwork, as well as increasing their curiosity and encouraging them to experiment with the technology.

In medicine this phenomenon is particularly relevant as left and right are always defined with respect to the patient's point of view, i.e. the doctor's right is the patient's left. Traditional anatomy learning resources such as illustrations in textbooks naturally consider this by consistently depicting the anatomy of a patient as seen by an observer standing in front. Augmented Reality Magic Mirrors (MM) are one example of novel anatomy teaching resources and show a user's digital mirror image augmented with virtual anatomy on a large display. As left and right appear to be reversed in such MM setups, similar to real-world physical mirrors, intriguing perceptual questions arise: is a non-reversing MM (NRMM) the more natural choice for the task of anatomy learning and do users even learn anatomy the wrong way with a traditional, reversing MM (RMM)? In this paper, we explore the perceptual differences between an NRMM and RMM design and present the first empirical study comparing these two concepts for the purpose of anatomy learning. Experimental results demonstrate that medical students perform significantly better at identifying anatomically correct placement of virtual organs in an NRMM. However, interaction was significantly more difficult compared to an RMM. We explore the underlying psychological effects and discuss the implications of using an NRMM on user perception, knowledge transfer, and interaction. This study is relevant for the design of future MM systems in the medical domain and lessons-learned can be transferred to other application domains.","","978-1-5386-2943-7","10.1109/ISMAR.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115415","","Mirrors;Education;Augmented reality;Medical diagnostic imaging;Games","augmented reality;biomedical education;computer aided instruction;data visualisation;medical computing;psychology;teaching","NRMM;RMM;future MM systems;augmented reality anatomy learning;impeded ability;patient;traditional anatomy learning resources;Augmented Reality Magic Mirrors;anatomy teaching resources;virtual anatomy;MM setups;real-world physical mirrors;intriguing perceptual questions;medicine;virtual organs;knowledge transfer;nonreversing MM","","4","","57","","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This newfound ubiquity needs to be matched by improved parallel programming education. As parallel programming involves higher level concepts, students tend to struggle with turning the abstract information into concrete mental models. Analogies are known to aid in this knowledge transfer, by providing an existing schema as the basis for the formation of a new schema. Additionally, technology has been proven to increase motivation and engagement in students, which ultimately improves learning. Combining these ideas, this paper presents several contributions that enhance aspects of parallel programming education. These contributions include a set of collaborative learning activities to target fundamental scheduling concepts, a detailed analogy to assist in the understanding of the scheduling concepts, and an augmented reality application to facilitate the collaborative learning activity by bringing the analogy to life.","","978-1-5386-5555-9","10.1109/IPDPSW.2018.00063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425430","Analogies;Augmented reality;Collaborative learning;Scheduling policies","Education;Augmented reality;Collaborative work;Parallel programming;Smart phones;Headphones","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer science education;groupware;parallel programming","instructional approach;learning parallel programming scheduling concepts;concrete mental models;collaborative learning activity;fundamental scheduling concepts;augmented reality application;ParallelAR;parallel programming education","","","","32","","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EmotionVR takes traditional methods of therapy aimed at teaching emotion recognition and translates it into an interesting and interactive narrative that provides users the opportunity to learn and practice emotion recognition in realistic settings. This work observed and analyzed the interaction between adults with developmental disabilities, and the HTC Vive and virtual environments. While the game supports the idea that virtual reality is a feasible method of providing such therapies, users found some discomfort with using the HTC Vive, and had slight difficulty translating what they had learned from the game in different situational contexts.

The virtual anesthesia machine (VAM) is an interactive, abstract 2D transparent reality simulation of the internal components and invisible gas flows of an anesthesia machine. It is widely used in anesthesia education. However when presented with an anesthesia machine, some students have difficulty transferring abstract VAM knowledge to the concrete real device. This paper presents the augmented anesthesia machine (AAM). The AAM applies a magic-lens approach to combine the VAM simulation and a real anesthesia machine. The AAM allows students to interact with the real anesthesia machine while visualizing how these interactions affect the internal components and invisible gas flows in the real world context. To evaluate the AAM's learning benefits, a user study was conducted. Twenty participants were divided into either the VAM (abstract only) or AAM (concrete+abstract) conditions. The results of the study show that MR can help users bridge their abstract and concrete knowledge, thereby improving their knowledge transfer into real world domains.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-1971-5","10.1109/VR.2008.4480746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4480746","J.3 [Computer Applications]: Life and Medical Sciences ¿ Health;Mixed Reality;Modeling and Simulation;Anesthesiology;Psychology;User Studies","Virtual reality;Merging;Concrete;Anesthesia;Active appearance model;Fluid flow;Machine learning;Visualization;Bridges;Knowledge transfer","medical computing;user interfaces;virtual reality","mixed reality approach;anesthesia machine education;virtual anesthesia machine;2D transparent reality simulation;augmented anesthesia machine","","19","12","22","","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present empirical findings showing that the simplified simulation is still playable and positively contributes to the game play.

The main focus is on gestures, which are related to skill, performance, or physical emotion (not facial) e.g. sports, martial arts, playing instruments, acting, etc. The initial idea behind this design is to provide a virtual practice environment mainly for actors in order to learn new gestures or moves. However, this virtual environment can also be used by many other target audiences based on their needs. Sometimes, ambiguity is part of knowledge transfer and becomes more salient or critical when it comes to tacit knowledge, especially at early stages of transfer. Performance while maintaining believable gesture is a must have requirement for actors. Visual references (mainly video in absence of trainer) are commonly used by actors in order to learn specific moves or gestures. However, videos are limited to 2D screen view (even if stereoscopic or 360°) and do not provide chance of studying a freezing moment from all angles, simultaneously. Although this can be partly mimicked using multi-camera rig, it is still limited to the number of shots taken and only provides a linear frame sequence (mostly used as VFX). Immersive virtual environments not only eliminate this limitation but also provide one to one scale experience. In this study, the process of creating such environment is discussed in detail. This includes planning, concept design, selecting tools, establishing the environment, properly selecting or creating the virtual character(s), capturing the motion or using existing ones from different Mocap libraries, actor's interaction with VR equipment, user experience, etc. In addition to studying reference moves and gestures (frame by frame and from any angle), the user is able to observe his/her performance in VR. This can be achieved using motion capture cameras installed at the practice location. The captured content is later assigned to the user's virtual representative i.e. a 3d character created based on his/her physical body features for side by side analysis with the reference. This provides countless interaction possibilities that cannot be achieved in the real world. Few examples are: multiplying the reference character and freeze two or more different moments (frames) and create a walkthrough, creating an immersive timeline based on the actor's progress (also requires multiplying), assigning reference moves to the user's avatar to be compared with his/her movements by himself/herself or anyone else (different from side by side comparison with the reference character), and many others. What has been discussed above is fully illustrated and described in this paper including detailed figures. The contribution of this study can be extended to various fields from acting and sport to stop motion and creative art, as the processes presented in the paper are designed in the most affordable way, using hardware and software currently available to basic users.","2474-1485","978-1-5386-4494-2","10.1109/VSMM.2017.8346255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8346255","immersive virtual environments;immersive virtual reality;tacit knowledge transfer;gesture;virtual reality;mocap;learning in virtual reality;htc vive;oculus rift;unity;steam vr","Teleportation;Knowledge transfer;Observers;Virtual environments;Art;Tools;Three-dimensional displays","gesture recognition;virtual reality","reference character;reference moves;immersive virtual environments;tacit knowledge transfer;virtual practice environment;believable gesture;virtual character;virtual representative","","1","","10","","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The VR users will send their uplink tracking information to the BS and receive the VR images in the downlink. To satisfy VR users' delay target, the BSs can change the image transmission format for each image requested by users so as to reduce the downlink traffic load. Meanwhile, the VR users can directly rotate the already received VR image and use the rotated VR images at a later time to further reduce the downlink traffic load. This 360° image transmission and image rotation problem is then formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful transmission probability which is defined as the probability that the delay of tracking information and image transmission for each VR user satisfies the VR delay requirement. A liquid state machine (LSM) based transfer learning algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization problem. The proposed LSM-baseda transfer learning algorithm enables each BS to transfer the already learned successful transmission to the new successful transmission that must be learned so as to increase the convergence speed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 14.9% gain in terms of successful transmission probability compared to Q-learning.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761494","","Image communication;Wireless communication;Delays;Downlink;Standards;Liquids;Optimization","optimisation;probability;radio networks;telecommunication traffic;virtual reality","VR delay requirement;learned successful transmission;wireless VR networks;virtual reality users;downlink traffic load;received VR image;rotated VR images;image rotation problem;image transmission;liquid state based transfer learning","","2","","15","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The bottleneck of such an architecture usually lies in the fact that transferring the state of the whole CA significantly slows down the simulation. We bypass this by sending only a small subset of the general state, which we call a 'locus of visibility', akin to a torchlight in a darkened 3D space, into the simulation. The torchlight concept exists in many games but these games generally only simulate what is in or near the locus. Our chosen architecture will enable us to simulate on a micro level outside the locus.

Recent work has explored how robotic caregivers can learn to interact with people through physics simulations, yet transferring what has been learned to real robots remains challenging. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to help bridge the gap between simulations and the real world. We present Assistive VR Gym (AVR Gym), which enables real people to interact with virtual assistive robots. We also provide evidence that AVR Gym can help researchers improve the performance of simulation-trained assistive robots with real people. Prior to AVR Gym, we trained robot control policies (Original Policies) solely in simulation for four robotic caregiving tasks (robot-assisted feeding, drinking, itch scratching, and bed bathing) with two simulated robots (PR2 from Willow Garage and Jaco from Kinova). With AVR Gym, we developed Revised Policies based on insights gained from testing the Original policies with real people. Through a formal study with eight participants in AVR Gym, we found that the Original policies performed poorly, the Revised policies performed significantly better, and that improvements to the biomechanical models used to train the Revised policies resulted in simulated people that better match real participants. Notably, participants significantly dis-agreed that the Original policies were successful at assistance, but significantly agreed that the Revised policies were successful at assistance. Overall, our results suggest that VR can be used to improve the performance of simulation-trained control policies with real people without putting people at risk, thereby serving as a valuable stepping stone to real robotic assistance.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-6075-7","10.1109/RO-MAN47096.2020.9223609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223609","","","biomechanics;geriatrics;handicapped aids;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical robotics;mobile robots;virtual reality","simulated robots;simulated people;simulation-trained control policies;robotic assistance;virtual assistive robots;versatile robotic caregivers;physics simulations;simulation-trained assistive robots;robot control policies;robotic caregiving tasks;drinking;assistive VR gym;revised policies;AVR gym","","","","48","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is not clear what should be varied to optimize learning. In this study, we investigate whether practicing to modulate or regulate performance parameters, during practice of a virtual shuffleboard task, leads to better transfer of learning between tasks. Our results indicate that during practice, the parameter that was held constant improved the most during initial learning, and transferred best to a task requiring modulation of that parameter. Translation of this improvement into task performance depended upon the sensitivity of each task to changes in each variable. We conclude that during variable practice, learning to regulate, not modulate task variables leads to optimal learning and transfer.

A training approach based on the combination of VR and gamification could speed up this overall learning process and not just for a novice. In this paper we evaluate how gamification in a VR training session can improve the efficiency of the training and the accuracy of the task execution in a real-world practical test. In the training scenario of this study, 50 randomly assigned participants were divided into two groups. The groups were assigned to a gamified and a non-gamified version of the same VR training and were then guided through a step-by-step tutorial outlining how to solve an assembly task. Performance differences were evaluated based on time taken and specific errors made during the training session.

The experiences were in the form of two field trips featuring statistically identical wildflower reserves. While the results support that the Real is superior for learning activity, they also show that the Virtual is useful for priming and reinforcing in-curriculum material, or for situations when the real environment is inaccessible. Offering the Virtual first primes for learning activity in the Real; if used second, it reinforces the Real experience, as supporting evidence shows significant transfer effects. Thus, the Virtual may serve educational goals, if used appropriately, and can come close to the Real. As informal learning environments, such as field trips and video games, are accepted as motivational, an attitudinal survey was conducted postexperiences to capture motivational factors at play, to aid in comparison and contrast, and to provide context to the empirical results on learning activity in situ; however, more work is needed.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2010.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539765","Child-computer-environment interaction;child-computer interface;discovery-based learning;educational simulation;evaluation/methodology;serious games;human factors in software design;human-computer interaction;human information processing;informal learning;intrinsic learning;salient events;simulation;modeling;visualization;software psychology;virtual reality;user-centered design;user interfaces.","Biological system modeling;Solid modeling;Software;Virtual environment;Games;Environmental factors","computer aided instruction;computer games;virtual reality","virtual trillium trails;virtual reality used;learning activity;video game technology;discovery-based learning;informal learning environments","","17","","51","","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, the learning curve for mastering such systems is very slow due to the motion-coupling mode that is usually presented in these systems for manipulating a surgical tool. This mode has limitations compared to the direct mapping mode used in open surgery for manipulating a tool. Virtual reality (VR) surgical simulators may reduce the learning time for transferring the surgeon's skills from direct mapping to motion coupling of tool manipulation. This may be accomplished by adding two features to the simulator. First, force models of tool-tissue interaction can be implemented in the haptic interface of the simulator. Second, VR-based surgical tasks can be designed to recreate directmapping mode and motion coupling mode of tool manipulation, as in open and robot-assisted surgeries, respectively. This may permit to transfer the surgeon's skills from open surgery to robotassisted surgery in a timely manner. This work presents a preliminary study on the effect of direct mapping mode and motion coupling mode of tool manipulation on the performance of naïve participants for VR-based brain tissue dissection. An Analytic force model of soft-tissue dissection was implemented in the simulator along with visual feedback of a predefined tool speed of 1 mm/s, which is observed in neurosurgery. The outcomes indicated that the motion quality of the tool via direct mapping was significantly better than with motion coupling.

In a between-subjects experiment, 60 participants were trained to solve three 3D burr puzzles in one of six conditions comprised of virtual and physical training elements. In the four physical conditions, training was delivered via paper- and video-based instructions, with or without the physical puzzles to practice with. In the two virtual conditions, participants learnt to assemble the puzzles in an interactive virtual environment, with or without 3D animations showing the assembly process. After training, we conducted immediate tests in which participants were asked to solve a physical version of the puzzles. We measured performance through success rates and assembly completion testing times. We also measured training times as well as subjective ratings on several aspects of the experience. Our results show that the performance of virtually trained participants was promising. A statistically significant difference was not found between virtual training with animated instructions and the best performing physical condition (in which physical blocks were available during training) for the last and most complex puzzle in terms of success rates and testing times.

In this paper, the problem of wireless VR resource management is investigated for a wireless VR network in which VR contents are sent by a cloud to cellular small base stations (SBSs). The SBSs will collect tracking data from the VR users, over the uplink, in order to generate the VR content and transmit it to the end-users using downlink cellular links. For this model, the data requested or transmitted by the users can exhibit correlation, since the VR users may engage in the same immersive virtual environment with different locations and orientations. As such, the proposed resource management framework can factor in such spatial data correlation, so as to better manage uplink and downlink traffic. This potential spatial data correlation can be factored into the resource allocation problem to reduce the traffic load in both the uplink and downlink. In the downlink, the cloud can transmit 360° contents or specific visible contents (e.g., user field of view) that are extracted from the original 360° contents to the users according to the users' data correlation so as to reduce the backhaul traffic load. In the uplink, each SBS can associate with the users that have similar tracking information so as to reduce the tracking data size. This data correlation-aware resource management problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful transmission probability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies an instantaneous VR delay target. To solve this problem, a machine learning algorithm that uses echo state networks (ESNs) with transfer learning is introduced. By smartly transferring information on the SBS's utility, the proposed transfer-based ESN algorithm can quickly cope with changes in the wireless networking environment due to users' content requests and content request distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed algorithm achieves up to 15.8% and 29.4% gains in terms of successful transmission probability compared to Q-learning with data correlation and Q-learning without data correlation, respectively.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2900624","National Natural Science Foundation of China; 111 Project; BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation; National Science Foundation; ERC Starting MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648419","Virtual reality;resource allocation;echo state networks;transfer learning","Correlation;Wireless communication;Resource management;Downlink;Uplink;Cloud computing;Virtual reality","cellular radio;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;probability;resource allocation;virtual reality","resource allocation problem;data correlation-aware resource management problem;optimization problem;content transmission delay;instantaneous VR delay target;transfer learning;transfer-based ESN algorithm;wireless networking environment;content request distributions;wireless virtual reality users;wireless VR resource management;wireless VR network;VR content;cellular small base stations;SBSs;VR users;downlink cellular links;immersive virtual environment;resource management framework;downlink traffic;spatial data correlation;cloud-enabled cellular networks;echo state transfer learning approach","","12","","31","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a simple versus a complex VE on motor learning of a novel balance task in typically developing (TD) children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). In addition, we explored the relationship between children's motivation, engagement and their motor learning outcomes in each VE. Twenty-seven TD children and 6 children with hemiplegic or diplegic CP participated. Participants were randomized to practice the same novel postural control task in either a simple or a complex flat-screen display VE. Motor learning was measured by an error metric per trial. Following 40 acquisition trials, children completed motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and engagement (User Engagement Scale) measures. They returned 2-7 days later for retention and transfer tests. Children with CP had significantly greater performance errors as compared to TD children at all sessions; however, there was no difference in performance between simple and complex VE conditions at any session, nor were there any differences in engagement or motivation between conditions or groups. Lower self-reported motivation was associated with greater performance error at retention and transfer in all participants. Study results provide no evidence for an effect of VE audiovisual complexity on children's motor learning or affective state.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994487","virtual environments;motor learning;motivation;engagement;children;cerebral palsy","Task analysis;Games;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Complexity theory;Visualization;Pediatrics","computer games;gait analysis;mechanoception;medical disorders;neurophysiology;paediatrics;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;virtual reality","user engagement scale;intrinsic motivation inventory;physical therapy;neuromotor conditions;complex flat-screen display;virtual environment complexity;motor learning;cerebral palsy","","","","31","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coupled-clay consists of two network-connected workspaces, the Physical Interaction Space and the Virtual Interaction Space. The physical interaction space allows a user to directly manipulate a physical object whose shape and position are precisely tracked. This tracked 3D information is transferred to the virtual interaction space in real time. The virtual interaction space is made of an interactive multi-user stereoscopic 3D tabletop, or other 3D displays with adequate interaction device. The users at the virtual interaction space observe the virtual 3D object which corresponds to the physical object and manipulate its geometrical attributes (e.g., translation, rotation and scaling). Additionally, they can control the graphical attributes of the virtual object such as color and texture. Information about changes in geometrical and graphical attributes are sent back to the physical interaction space in real time and reflected to the object in the physical interaction space by a robotic arm and a top-mounted projector. Coupled-clay can be used to remotely collaborate on 3D modeling tasks such as between a skilled designer and novice learners.

Automated end-product assessment can be carried out by performance classifiers built from a set of expert performances. When applied to temporal bone surgery simulation, these classifiers can evaluate performance on the bone specimen they were trained on, but they cannot be extended to new specimens. Thus, new expert performances need to be recorded for each new specimen, requiring considerable time commitment from time-poor expert surgeons. To eliminate this need, we propose a transfer learning framework to adapt a classifier built on a single temporal bone specimen to multiple specimens. Once a classifier is trained, we translate each new specimens' features to the original feature space, which allows us to carry out performance evaluation on different specimens using the same classifier. In our experiment, we built a surgical end-product performance classifier from 16 expert trials on a simulated temporal bone specimen. We applied the transfer learning approach to 8 new specimens to obtain machine generated end-products. We also collected end-products for these 8 specimens drilled by a single expert. We then compared the machine generated end-products to those drilled by the expert. The drilled regions generated by transfer learning were similar to those drilled by the expert.","1051-4651","978-1-4799-5209-0","10.1109/ICPR.2014.335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977047","transfer learning;anatomy registration;automatic evaluation","Surgery;Bones;Anatomical structure;Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Decision trees;Training","bone;feature extraction;image classification;image registration;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;surgery;virtual reality","temporal bone performance model;anatomical feature registration;surgical procedures;virtual reality environments;simulation-based surgical training;automated end-product assessment;performance classifiers;temporal bone surgery simulation;bone specimen;time-poor expert surgeons;transfer learning framework;surgical end-product performance classifier;transfer learning approach;machine generated end-products","","","","17","","6 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being that the real humans may not be available to play different roles and support virtual sessions, the ability of a system to generate highly believable representations of autonomous virtual humans - virtual intelligent agents - is vital in achieving specific learning and training objectives. Eliminating the elements of the system that can cause a negative learning and training transfer is a paramount in those systems. We illustrate the results of two user studies focused on validation of non-deterministic domain-specific behaviors generated by our system (example: behaviors typical for a well coordinated group of paramedics or military unit).

This paper presents an experiment to investigate knowledge transfer in a group-based learning game. We introduce a VR serious game to support teaching and learning processes in neuroanatomy health education. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 23 students to jointly assess learning, knowledge retention, and sense of presence. As a control condition, grouped students assembled a physical model of the human brain, while in the experimental condition, a virtual brain was assembled. In each group, one participant assembled the brain, while the others observed and verbally collaborated in a group-based learning strategy. Results shown high mean scores in the virtual condition. When comparing the knowledge test performance before and immediately after the experiment, we found significant difference only for the virtual condition. The same can be observed for retention. Because of the promising results achieved and motivated by the need of more engaging new tools for remote learning - fully used in quarantine conditions, such as the current one because of the Covid-19 pandemic - we conducted a pilot user study to evaluate the learning effect of a remote version of our collaborative VR game.","","978-1-7281-9231-4","10.1109/SVR51698.2020.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262701","Virtual Reality;Presence;User Evaluation","Education;Games;Training;Neuroanatomy;Collaboration;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling","computer aided instruction;human factors;serious games (computing);teaching;virtual reality","virtual condition;remote learning;learning effect;collaborative VR game;virtual reality;knowledge transfer;collaborative group-based learning;neuroanatomy students;teaching;learning processes;individual learning;VR serious game;neuroanatomy health education;between-subjects experiment;knowledge retention;control condition;grouped students;virtual brain;knowledge test performance","","","","44","","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To automatically infer facial expressions, convolutional neural network based approaches has become widely adopted due to their proven applicability to Facial Expression Recognition (FER) task.On the other hand Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity as an immersive multimedia platform, where FER can provide enriched media experiences. However, recognizing facial expression while wearing a head-mounted VR headset is a challenging task due to the upper half of the face being completely occluded. In this paper we attempt to overcome these issues and focus on facial expression recognition in presence of a severe occlusion where the user is wearing a head-mounted display in a VR setting. We propose a geometric model to simulate occlusion resulting from a Samsung Gear VR headset that can be applied to existing FER datasets. Then, we adopt a transfer learning approach, starting from two pretrained networks, namely VGG and ResNet. We further fine-tune the networks on FER+ and RAF-DB datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable results to existing methods while training on three modified benchmark datasets that adhere to realistic occlusion resulting from wearing a commodity VR headset.

One proposed mechanism is via enhanced user engagement and/or motivation, which may directly influence the quality of motor memory consolidation. The objectives of this study were to a) compare children's motor learning of the same novel postural reaching task in a VE versus a PE; b) evaluate differences in engagement and motivation between the two practice environments; and c) explore the relationships between practice environment, engagement, motivation, and motor learning. Thirty-six typically developing children aged 7-13 years were randomized to acquire a novel postural reaching skill in either a 2D flat-screen VE or a PE. Skin conductance level (SCL) was measured on the non-task hand during practice. Following acquisition, children completed a language-modified User Engagement Scale (UES) and the Pediatric Motivation Inventory (PMOT). Participants returned 1-7 days later for retention (same environment) and transfer (opposite environment) tests. Children who practiced in the VE demonstrated greater retention, as evidenced by higher mean scores on the retention test (t[30] = -3.72, p = 0.001, partial eta squared 0.28). Children who practiced in the PE demonstrated greater transfer to the opposite environment as compared to those who practiced in the VE (t[30] = 2.05, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.238). There were no significant differences in UES total or subscale scores between the 2 groups. PMOT total motivation scores differed significantly between groups, favoring the VE (t[30]= 2.49, p = 0.018, partial eta squared = 0.154). There were no significant differences in SCL peak count or peaks per minute between groups. There was no relationship between engagement, motivation, and retention or transfer performance. Findings suggest that retention but not transfer of a new motor skill may be facilitated by practice in a VE. This may be due to unique task demands in each environment. Children were more motivated to succeed in the VE and were engaged in the task in both environments, suggesting that both constructs should be measured in subsequent studies and that VE aesthetics alone may not be a key `active ingredient' of children's engagement. Subsequent research will more objectively quantify neurophysiological correlates of engagement and motivation, explore additional tasks, include populations with neurological impairments and compare 3D vs 2D VE displays.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007489","Virtual reality;video game;motor learning;engagement;motivation;children","Games;Pediatrics;Virtual environments;Medical treatment;Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays","computer games;medical computing;neurophysiology;paediatrics;skin;virtual reality","children motor learning;postural reaching task;virtual environment;pediatric rehabilitation;motor learning;physical environment;user engagement;motor memory consolidation;practice environment;skin conductance level;nontask hand;language-modified user engagement scale;pediatric motivation inventory;PMOT;UES;SCL;retention test;neurophysiological correlates;motivation impairments;3D VE displays;2D VE displays","","","","18","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design of vCLOT combines the immersivity of virtual worlds with the power of knowledge structures. Immersivity provides learners with the opportunity to make decisions at every level of the game. This transfers control of interaction to the learner, enabling the learner to be actively engaged in knowledge construction process. Knowledge structures are a neat way to represent domain and learner data. The user interface of vCLOT is designed and implemented with Open Wonderland which is an open-source 3D toolkit. The learning goal which is to learn about blood clotting process, is aligned with the game goal, which is application of blood clot process steps to heal an injury. The game goal is presented as a quest in which the learner interacts with concepts by either dragging them or synthesizing them from other concepts. Learners complete the quest on successful formation of blood clot which in turn implies that they have learnt the blood clot process.

In this manuscript, we seek to compare virtual reality training to inanimate model training, with regard to skill learning and skill transfer. Using a custom-developed needle-driving training task with inanimate and virtual analogs, we investigated the extent to which N=18 participants improved their skill on a given platform post-training, and transferred that skill to the opposite platform. Results indicate that the two approaches are not equivalent, with more salient skill transfer after inanimate training than virtual training.

In game based learning there is often a tradeoff in motivation between the educational aspects and game aspects. For example, consider our previous work - a tangible augmented reality application for passive solar energy education (AR-SEE), in which users learn about the science behind architectural design by interacting with a tangible model house and an augmented reality-based visualization of energy transfer within the house. This research extends AR-SEE to begin to convert this educational simulation into an effective educational game by introducing gaming elements, such as interactive virtual humans. Although it is known that AR-SEE does enable learning, it is unknown how the addition of interactive virtual humans will affect user perception of temperature data and learning. In this paper, the goal was to compare user perception of two approaches to temperature data visualization in in tangible augmented reality on mobile phones: (1) the current particle-based visualization (i.e., based on the science of energy transfer) and (2) novel virtual human-based visualizations. The game was intended for high school students. However, as a preliminary study, we conducted a user study with 27 3rd and 4th year architecture students that compared these two visualization approaches and their impact on temperature estimation, motivation, and perceived learning effectiveness. In the future, we plan to integrate this game into high school curricula.","","978-1-5386-1892-9","10.1109/KELVAR.2017.7961559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961559","Augmented reality;education;visualization","Estimation;Education;Cameras;Measurement;Solar energy;Heating systems","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;computer games;data visualisation;educational courses;educational institutions;human factors;mobile computing","virtual humans;temperature visualization;tangible augmented reality educational game;educational aspects;game aspects;educational simulation;mobile phones;particle-based visualization;virtual human-based visualizations;high school curricula","","1","","14","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A range of scientific laboratory studies already demonstrated the potential of augmented reality (AR) technologies especially for training tasks. However, most researches are limited in terms of inadequate task complexity, measured variables and lacking comparisons. In this paper, we want to close this gap by introducing a novel multimodal HMD-based training application and compare it to paper-based learning for manual assembly tasks. We perform a user study with 30 participants measuring the training transfer of an engine assembly training task, the user satisfaction and perceived workload during the experiment. Established questionnaires such as the system usability scale (SUS), the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) and the Nasa Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) are used for the assessment. Results indicate significant differences between both learning approaches. Participants perform significantly faster and significantly worse using paper-based instructions.

An important issue for the establishment of effective training and retraining (rehabilitation) programs is whether skills gained while training in laboratory settings can be transferred to performance gains in somewhat different conditions (including every-day life). While there is much evidence showing that for volitional motor tasks the gains in performance (procedural, implicit, knowledge) accrued in practice may not always be transferable to novel task conditions, it is not clear whether the (implicit) knowledge gained in learning postural adjustments can be transferred to measures of balance (reaction to external perturbations) that have not been trained. The objective of the current study was to elucidate what aspects of a postural skill learned within a virtual environment (VE) by healthy adults may be transferable to the performance of standard tests of postural adjustments. Sixteen healthy young adults, aged 20-40 years (mean alpha SD = 29.8 alpha 2.8 years), were pseudo-randomly assigned to either a training group (Group A) or a no-training, control group (Group B). Group A performed a single training session in a VE in which maintenance of stability on a platform, while travelling along a road scenario and reaching for visual targets (secondary task) were required. Each participant underwent 8 consecutive runs of the task (2:48 m per run). A balance assessment with a given set of perturbations was performed before and after training as well as at 24 hours and 4 weeks post-training. Group B underwent the same assessments but without VE training. The results showed that the Center of Pressure (CoP) displacement tended to decrease over successive balance assessments in both groups, however, this decrease was not statistically significant. Moreover, there was no clear advantage for Group A. Thus, the postural adjustment gains were not transferred to the balance assessment tests. Non-volitional balance control gains are, in this respect, similar to gains attained in a volitional manual task learning.","2331-9569","978-1-4244-4188-4","10.1109/ICVR.2009.5174220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5174220","Postural adjustments;Procedural knowledge;specificity;transfer","Virtual environment;Testing;Stability;Performance gain;Delay effects;Medical tests;Virtual reality;Laboratories;Gain measurement;Aging","biomechanics;computer based training;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","balance control skills;postural control skills;single training session;retraining programs;rehabilitation programs;virtual environment;stability;postural adjustment learning;healthy adults;visual target reaching;road scenario;center of pressure displacement","","","","23","","24 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If the state and action domains of the problem are immense, the learning rate of the agent decreases dramatically and eventually the agent loses the ability to learn. In order to eliminate the effects of the curse of the dimensionality, researchers typically concentrate on the methods that reduce the complexity of the problems. While some of them model the problem in a hierarchical manner, the others try to transfer the knowledge obtained during the learning process of simpler tasks. While learning from scratch ignores the previous experiences, transferring full knowledge may mislead the agent because of the conflicting requirements. The main goal of this study is to improve the learning rate of the agent by transferring the relevant parts of the knowledge acquired as a result of previous experiences. The main contribution of this study is to merge these two approaches to transfer only the relevant knowledge in a setting.

Pilot training typically occurs on-the-job, where equipment is placed at risk, controlled learning situations are hard to create, and time for instruction is minimal. The TRANSoM (TRAiNing for remote Sensing and Manipulation) project is developing a training environment that combines two emerging technologies to overcome these limitations. A virtual environment (VE) simulates the ROV and its surroundings, and also has instructional enhancements such as external views of the ROV, directional cues and alternate modes of interaction with the vehicle, e.g. a head-tracked head-mounted display (HMD). An intelligent tutoring system (ITS) monitors student pilot behavior and offers verbal and graphical feedback, a mission review and a performance assessment.

In this context, each new teaching methodology should be field tested, which can be time consuming. Introducing a simulation that can pre-test methodologies to check their efficiency can assist in the methodological building process. Research questions: The proposed simulation environment helps in understanding the differences in the learning rate of a group of agents (students) with different levels of humanization and instruction. Methodology: Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) was used to build the causal relationship between the students and a PBL methodology, to generate the input data for the simulation. Based on the analysis of the responses to a survey performed over five consecutive semesters, it was possible to generate some cause-effect data parameters to be used as the input for a hybrid type of ABS, known as PLS agent.

Haptically-enabled science simulations enable students to experience abstract scientific concepts through concrete and observable lessons in which students can physically experience the concepts being taught through haptic feedback. The present study aims to investigate the effect of an educational simulation on the understanding of basic physics concepts related to buoyancy. Specifically, we hypothesize that a simulation with visual and haptic feedback will improve participant learning transfer.","","978-1-7281-6532-5","10.1109/VRW50115.2020.00157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090605","Human computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms;Virtual reality;Education;Interactive learning environments","Haptic interfaces;Visualization;Training;Buoyancy;Solid modeling;Liquids","computer aided instruction;educational courses;haptic interfaces;physics education;teaching;virtual reality","haptic feedback;haptically-enabled science simulations;visual feedback;teaching;virtual reality learning;participant learning transfer;educational practices;physics concepts;buoyancy","","","","5","","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach for learning complex topics, like creating simulations, is through gaming. This paper reports on the creative use of regular simulation tools to develop simulation games with entertainment content aimed towards engaging young learners. Two games are presented: one focuses on the use of decision nodes while the second focuses on the use of batch/separator nodes.

Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step.

When this IoT technology is combined with Augmented Reality (AR), it will provide end users with real time as well as real world information. One of the prime advantages of AR combining with IoT is the bridging of the gap between the real and digital worlds around us. The ease of downloading features and scope of dynamic usage which AR brings to the smart devices and is expected to bring to the IoT is beyond human imagination! The education sector is expected to gain significantly using these technologies. The goal of technology in education is to make, learning easier, faster and more engaging for the students and to equip the instructor with powerful tools to provide more relevant courseware to their students. With introducing AR in education, we shall be able to provide contextually aware, more relevant, engaging and interactive courseware to the students, which would keep them interested in subject. Also, through IoT, the physical devices can provide context that the AR ecosystem would use for contextually aware rendering of multimedia content. Medical education domain is expected to gain significantly using IOT and AR. It is also observed that the training in the areas of equipment maintenance could gain significantly by applying these technologies judiciously. For eg. The conventional software virtual lab solution does not provide a real feel of performing an experiment. However, using IOT and AR technology, a sensor enabled Hardware based real lab environment can be created for performing the volumetric analysis experiments in chemistry by using WATER instead of Chemicals. C-DAC has developed few AR products in education domain - AR Board, AR Book and AR Game. AR Board is a virtual writing board on which a user can write with a laser pointer. It uses projection based AR Technology by creating a virtual environment for contextual information presentation, and facilitates real-time interaction with the content. AR Book is a standard book that has been instrumented with AR markers printed, which when scanned would show augmented, 3D interactive content, videos, audio and animations contextually, on a printed book, thus adding new dimensionality to it. AR Game is a game based learning mobile application that can be used by students for learning through playing, and for evaluating their knowledge. The technology of these products has been transferred to industry for their further development and proliferation to various educational institutes.","","978-1-5386-1922-3","10.1109/ELELTECH.2017.8074987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074987","","","augmented reality;biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;Internet of Things;mobile computing","augmented reality;smart devices;IoT technology;education sector;medical education domain;Internet of Things technology;IoT;e-learning;AR technology;AR board;AR book;AR game;game based learning mobile application","","1","","","","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose this as a lightweight, flexible, and efficient solution for visual control, as first, no extra transfer steps are required during the expensive training of DRL agents in simulation; second, the trained DRL agents will not be constrained to being deployable in only one specific real-world environment; and third, the policy training and the transfer operations are decoupled, and can be conducted in parallel. Besides this, we propose a simple yet effective shift loss that is agnostic to the downstream task, to constrain the consistency between subsequent frames which is important for consistent policy outputs. We validate the shift loss for artistic style transfer for videos and domain adaptation, and validate our visual control approach in indoor and outdoor robotics experiments.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2894216","Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission; German Research Foundation; Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR Government, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620258","Deep learning in robotics and automation;visual-based navigation;model learning for control","Visualization;Training;Robots;Adaptation models;Semantics;Task analysis;Navigation","control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;robot vision;virtual reality","VR-goggles;real-to-sim domain adaptation;deep reinforcement learning policies;simulated environments;real-world domain;visual control tasks;visual fidelity;synthetic images output;training phase;real-world image streams;synthetic domain;expensive training;trained DRL agents;real-world environment;policy training;transfer operations;consistent policy outputs;artistic style transfer;visual control approach;indoor robotics experiments;outdoor robotics experiments;synthetic image output;real-world image stream translation;DRL agent training;shift loss;domain adaptation","","12","","30","","20 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Adaptive networks can be easily trained to associate arbitrary input and output patterns. When subgroups of patterns (lists) are presented sequentially, however, a network tends to 'unlearn' previously acquired associations while learning new associations. A second form of sequential learning problem is reported. Learning of each successive list of pattern pairs becomes progressively more difficult. Evidence for this cumulative negative transfer was obtained from simulations using backpropagation of errors to train multilayer networks. The cause of the problem appears to be the development of extreme weights during the learning of new lists. Unbounded weights may be a liability for the backpropagation algorithm.<>","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=118508","","Adaptive systems;Learning systems;Neural networks","adaptive systems;learning systems;neural nets","adaptive systems;neural nets;learning systems;second sequential learning;cumulative negative transfer;backpropagation","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

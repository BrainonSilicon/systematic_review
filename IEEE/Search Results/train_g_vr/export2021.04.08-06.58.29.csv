This paper reports on the results of a long development stage of a hybrid simulator for laparoscopic cholecystectomy that integrates real and the virtual components. We first outline the specifications of the AR simulator and then we explain the strategy adopted for implementing it based on a careful selection of its simulated anatomical components, and characterized by a real-time tracking of both a target anatomy and of the laparoscope. The former is tracked by means of an electromagnetic field generator, while the latter requires an additional camera for video tracking. The new system was evaluated in terms of AR visualization accuracy, realism, and hardware robustness. Obtained results show that the accuracy of AR visualization is adequate for training purposes. The qualitative evaluation confirms the robustness and the realism of the simulator. In conclusion, the proposed AR simulator satisfies all the initial specifications in terms of anatomical appearance, modularity, reusability, minimization of spare parts cost, and ability to record surgical errors and to track in real-time the Calot's triangle and the laparoscope. Thus, the proposed system could be an effective training tool for learning the task of identification and isolation of Calot's triangle in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Moreover, the presented strategy could be applied to simulate other surgical procedures involving the task of identification and isolation of generic tubular structures, such as blood vessels, biliary tree, and nerves, which are not directly visible.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2018.2883816","Augmented Reality Simulation; Italian Minister of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550677","Surgical simulator;laparoscopic simulation;augmented reality;hybrid simulators;physical anatomical model;cholecystectomy training","Laparoscopes;Solid modeling;Visualization;Training;Task analysis;Minimally invasive surgery","augmented reality;blood vessels;computer based training;data visualisation;medical computing;surgery;virtual reality","surgical simulation;hybrid laparoscopic simulator;hybrid surgical simulators;virtual reality simulators;hybrid simulator;laparoscopic cholecystectomy;virtual components;AR simulator;simulated anatomical components;real-time tracking;laparoscope;electromagnetic field generator;video tracking;AR visualization accuracy;hardware robustness;surgical errors;Calot's triangle;surgical procedures;augmented reality solutions","","2","","50","","28 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main goal is to provide an alternative to traditional training methods on animals, cadavers or real patients. Haptic feedback is a key feature for every surgery simulator for the training of hand-eye coordination. In this paper, a compact and portable haptic interface is presented for the colonoscopy. The haptic interface provides position data acquisition and force feedback in linear and rotational directions with combined electrical motors and passive brakes to cover a large range of forces. The motorized drives are used for active force feedback and friction compensation and the brakes are used for high force rendering without slipping.

While this process may require a few minutes to several hours, based on the number of vertices in the mesh, it needs only to be computed once and allows real-time computation of the subsequent soft tissue deformation. However, as the compliance matrix is based on the initial topology of the mesh, it does not allow any topological changes during simulation, such as cutting or tearing of the mesh.

This system depends on a structured posture space, which comprises a set of dance elements that represent key moments -- ""postures"", that typically will be so briefly held as to experience as a fleeting moment in a flux -- in the dance movements whose performance we are attempting to assess. The recording captured from the Kinect allows the parsing of dance movement into a structured posture space using the spherical self-organizing map (SSOM). From this, a unique descriptor can be obtained by following gesture trajectories through posture space on the SSOM, which appropriately reflects the subtleties of ballet dance movements. Consequently, the system can recognize the category of movement the student is attempting, and this allows us make a quantitative assessment of individual movements. Based on the experimental results, the proposed system appears to be very effective for recognition and offering generalization across instances of movement. Thus, it is possible for the construction of assessment and visualization of ballet dance movements performed by the student in an instructional, virtual reality setting.","","978-1-4799-4311-1","10.1109/ISM.2014.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033015","dance traning system;dance assesment;CAVE virtual reality environment;gesture recognition;spherical-self-organizing map","Trajectory;Training;Vectors;Gesture recognition;Joints;Histograms;Feature extraction","computer based training;gesture recognition;humanities;self-organising feature maps;virtual reality","computational intelligence system;ballet dance training;computer-based system;ballet dance assessment;CAVE virtual reality environment;Kinect sensor;student dance capture;feature extraction;skeleton joints;structured posture space;dance elements;key posture-moment representation;fleeting moment;dance movement parsing;spherical self-organizing map;SSOM;gesture trajectories;posture space;ballet dance movement subtleties;movement category recognition;quantitative assessment;generalization;movement instances;ballet dance movement assessment construction;ballet dance movement visualization construction;instructional virtual reality","","3","","25","","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hardware advancements have enabled replication of real-world interactions in virtual environments to a large extent, paving the way for commercial grade applications that provide a safe and risk-free training environment at a fraction of the cost. But this also mandates the need to develop more intrinsic interaction techniques and to empirically evaluate them in a more comprehensive manner. Although there exists a body of previous research that examines the benefits of selected levels of interaction fidelity on performance, few studies have investigated the constituent components of fidelity in a Interaction Fidelity Continuum (IFC) with several system instances and their respective effects on performance and learning in the context of a real-world skills training application. Our work describes a large between-subjects investigation conducted over several years that utilizes bimanual interaction metaphors at six discrete levels of interaction fidelity to teach basic precision metrology concepts in a near-field spatial interaction task in VR. A combined analysis performed on the data compares and contrasts the six different conditions and their overall effects on performance and learning outcomes, eliciting patterns in the results between the discrete application points on the IFC. With respect to some performance variables, results indicate that simpler restrictive interaction metaphors and highest fidelity metaphors perform better than medium fidelity interaction metaphors. In light of these results, a set of general guidelines are created for developers of spatial interaction metaphors in immersive virtual environments for precise fine-motor skills training simulations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794639","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260967","Bimanual Interaction;Interaction Fidelity;Empirical Evaluation;Educational Virtual Reality","Training;Aerospace electronics;Solid modeling;Metrology;Mice;Virtual environments","computer based training;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","Interaction Fidelity Continuum;near-field training simulations;virtual reality applications;education;real-world interactions;safe risk-free training environment;intrinsic interaction techniques;near-field spatial interaction task;learning outcomes;discrete application points;performance variables;medium fidelity interaction metaphors;spatial interaction metaphors;immersive virtual environments;fine-motor skills training simulations;bimanual interaction metaphors;restrictive interaction metaphors;head-mounted displays;tracking technology","Adolescent;Adult;Cognition;Female;High Fidelity Simulation Training;Humans;Male;Surveys and Questionnaires;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","1","","33","Traditional","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For each pixel in the output image, an L-shaped neighborhood of current pixel of a specific size is considered. Each pixel from this neighborhood generates a ¿shifted¿ candidate pixel according to its original position in the input texture.

These technologies were traditionally focused on entertainment; however, academia and industry are now exploring applications in other domains such as health, learning and training. Key to the success of these new multimedia experiences is the understanding of a user's perceived quality of experience (QoE). Subjective user ratings have been the primary mechanism to capture insights into a user's experience. Such ratings have generally been captured post experience and reflected using a mean opinion score (MOS). However, user perception is multifactorial and subjective ratings alone do not express the true measure of an experience. As a result, recent efforts to capture QoE have included exploring the use of implicit metrics (e.g., physiological measures). This article presents the results of an experimental QoE evaluation and comparison of immersive applications delivered across three multimedia platforms. The platforms compared were augmented reality, tablet and virtual reality.

Without these new methods, the understanding and operation of such systems would be very time consuming. For specialized engineers a regular and high-quality training is additionally necessary. The interactive computer-aided three dimensional representation allows online development and utilization of 3D environments and assures deeper contact, than any drawing or written description.

However, when developing tools for rehabilitation, it is essential to design interventions that will be most effective for generalizing to the real world. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors facilitate transfer from HMD-VR to non-HMD-VR environments. Here we used a well-established test of skilled motor learning, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), to train healthy individuals in an HMD-VR environment. We examined whether learned motor skills transferred to a more conventional (non-HMD-VR) environment and what factors facilitated transfer. Our results suggest that on average, learned motor skills from this task transfer from an immersive virtual environment to a conventional environment; however, some individuals did not transfer the learned motor skills. We then examined individual differences between those that did show transfer and those that did not. We found that individuals who had previous exposure to HMD-VR were more likely to transfer their learned motor skills than those who did not. Individual differences in previous exposure to HMD-VR environments prior to training may serve as a predictor to whether learned motor skills will transfer out of HMD-VR.","2331-9569","978-1-7281-1285-5","10.1109/ICVR46560.2019.8994345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994345","head-mounted virtual reality;skilled motor learning;transfer","","biomechanics;helmet mounted displays;learning (artificial intelligence);patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","HMD-VR environment;learned motor skills;head-mounted virtual reality;HMD-VR motor skills;motor rehabilitation;nonHMD-VR environments;skilled motor learning;immersive virtual environment","","","","9","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two versions of IFOREAL, each employing different devices, were developed. The consumer version uses a traditional LCD display and computer mouse, whereas the professional version utilizes a head-mounted display (HMD) and joystick controller for the virtual learning. Trainees watched simulated videos and interacted with the system to accomplish tasks. IFOREAL consists of several major learning modules of gynecology. This study used the normal spontaneous delivery module to research user experience and perceptions of the IFOREAL VR training system. The results suggested that most of the trainees' user experiences and perceptions of IFOREAL, using both the types of VR-assisted technology, were positively reported. Trainees who used the consumer version of IFOREAL perceived a stronger internal control, whereas trainees using the professional version perceived a better sense of virtual presence. Overall, trainees perceived the usefulness of the IFOREAL system which predicted their future intention to use the system and other similar VR-assisted training systems for learning. Furthermore, whether the virtual content of IFOREAL grabbed the trainees' attention predicted their future intenon to use professional devices of HMD/joysck for learning other subjects. The gender difference was also explored in the study. Generally speaking, female trainees gave better evaluations of IFOREAL compared to their male counterparts. They perceived a better internal control while using the consumer version than the professional version. Male trainees believed that the gadgets used in the professional version provided a better virtual presence and met their expectation of a virtual experience better.

This setup may add limitations to certain procedures and result in negative training, as those assumptions may not hold true during surgery. In this work, we investigate challenges in modeling general purpose haptic device simulations for minimally invasive surgeries, namely accurate pivoting around the insertion point, collisions with surrounding objects during procedure, and system scalability for various devices. The system behavior is evaluated on a Nuss procedure surgical simulator and tested by experienced surgeons on the field.

Thus, cognitive skills are highly demanded for novice surgeons to thoroughly interpret the relative positions between tool and tissue in images and make appropriate decisions about further catheter motions in case of collisions. In this paper, an operator's cognitive skills training system has been introduced, which exploits the tactile sensation to reinforce the visualized spatial positions between catheter tip and vascular wall in the VR simulator. In cooperation with the collision alert module (CAM) in the VR simulator, the newly developed catheter manipulator can provide tactile sensations for novices when catheter tip is threaded beyond safety boundary, so that the VR exhibited tool-tissue interaction can be deliberately intensified. For demonstrating such tactile sensations adequate to strengthen visions, the system model has been established to facilitate the analysis in the perspective of operator's kinesthetic perception. A series of experiments have been conducted at last and the results reveal that the catheter manipulator can not only realize the accurate catheter motions but also provide the enough tactile sensations for novices. Moreover, statistical data prove that subjects under cognitive trainings have developed the ability to interpret the relative spatial positions between catheter tip and vascular wall. Such findings support that the operator's cognitive skills can be enhanced by the tactile reinforcement of VR visualized tool-tissue interaction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982219","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9043517","Catheterization training system;cognitive skills;tactile sensation;VR simulator;collision detection","Catheters;Training;Surgery;Haptic interfaces;Force;Manipulators","catheters;cognition;haptic interfaces;manipulators;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery;touch (physiological);virtual reality","statistical data;operator kinesthetic perception;operator cognitive skill training system;operator cognitive skill enhancement;VR visualized tool-tissue interaction;tactile reinforcement;relative spatial positions;cognitive trainings;catheter motions;system model;catheter manipulator;collision alert module;VR simulator;vascular wall;catheter tip;visualized spatial positions;novice surgeons;collision force perceptions;introducer sheath;haptic forces;visual feedback;experienced surgeons;clinical vascular interventional surgery;tactile sensation assisted VR catheterization training system","","","","32","CCBY","20 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

Analysis of typical missions such as mine countermeasures and search/salvage yielded a set of general skills to be taught including manoeuvring, situational awareness, sensor data integration, and mission operations. Use of VE technology permits the creation of an enriched learning environment including simulation of a wide range of operational environments, vehicle configurations, learning aids, rind mission scenarios. The prototype training system is a VE-based Intelligent Tutor which implements various training aids and interventions to promote the development of both the sensorimotor and cognitive skills related to basic manoeuvring tasks and situational awareness. Once implemented, the training effectiveness of this prototype will be studied by analyzing pilot performance on an actual ROV.","","0-7803-3519-8","10.1109/OCEANS.1996.572546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=572546","","Virtual environment;Remotely operated vehicles;Intelligent sensors;Management training;Prototypes;Remote sensing;Humans;Logistics;On the job training;Performance analysis","mobile robots;computer based training;computer aided instruction;virtual reality;intelligent tutoring systems","virtual environment based training;ROV pilots;remotely operated vehicle;trained pilots;virtual environment;ROV piloting skills;mine countermeasures;search/salvage;cognitive skills;training aids;Intelligent Tutor;manoeuvring tasks;situational awareness","","2","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current VR accessibility applications have been developed either on expensive head-mounted displays or with extra accessories and mechanisms, which are either not accessible or inconvenient for BVI individuals. In this paper, we present a mobile VR app that enables BVI users to access a virtual environment on an iPhone in order to build their skills of perception and recognition of the virtual environment and the virtual objects in the environment. The app uses the iPhone on a selfie stick to simulate a long cane in VR, and applies Augmented Reality (AR) techniques to track the iPhone's real-time poses in an empty space of the real world, which is then synchronized to the long cane in the VR environment. Due to the use of mixed reality (the integration of VR & AR), we call it the Mixed Reality cane (MR Cane), which provides BVI users auditory and vibrotactile feedback whenever the virtual cane comes in contact with objects in VR. Thus, the MR Cane allows BVI individuals to interact with the virtual objects and identify approximate sizes and locations of the objects in the virtual environment. We performed preliminary user studies with blind-folded participants to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed mobile approach and the results indicate that the proposed MR Cane could be effective to help BVI individuals in understanding the interaction with virtual objects and exploring 3D virtual environments. The MR Cane concept can be extended to new applications of navigation, training and entertainment for BVI individuals without more significant efforts.","","978-1-7281-7675-8","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct51615.2020.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288373","Virtual Reality;Mixed Reality;Visually Impaired;Spatial Exploration","Training;Visualization;Navigation;Virtual environments;Tools;Space exploration;Augmented reality","augmented reality;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces;helmet mounted displays;mobile computing","3D virtual environment;blind and visually impaired;virtual reality;BVI;mobile VR app;virtual objects;augmented reality;VR environment;mixed reality cane;VR accessibility applications;MR cane;head-mounted displays;vibrotactile feedback;auditory feedback","","","","24","","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have the potential to overcome these limitations. However, due to its early stage of research, VR requires significant improvements to fully unlock its potential. The focus of this PhD is to tackle research challenges to enable VR for online training in three dimensions: (1) dynamic adaptation of the training content for personalised trainings, by incorporating prior knowledge and context data into self-learning algorithms; (2) mapping of sensor data onto what happens in the VR environment, by focusing on motion prediction techniques that use past movements of the users, and (3) investigating immersive environments with intuitive interactions, by gaining a better understanding of human motion in order to improve interaction.

The bottleneck of such an architecture usually lies in the fact that transferring the state of the whole CA significantly slows down the simulation. We bypass this by sending only a small subset of the general state, which we call a 'locus of visibility', akin to a torchlight in a darkened 3D space, into the simulation. The torchlight concept exists in many games but these games generally only simulate what is in or near the locus.

The controllers account for nonlinear models of the haptic devices and can cope with uncertainties present in the users and haptic devices dynamics. The performance and closed-loop stability of the proposed methods are demonstrated in two steps. First, using a Lyapunov analysis, the tracking behavior of the system is shown. Then given a priori known bounds on the users and environment parameters, the robust stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed based on the Nyquist envelops of interval plants and an off-axis circle criterion.

Similar to motion sickness in physical environments, VIMS can induce many physiological symptoms such as general discomfort, nausea, disorientation, vomiting, dizziness and fatigue. To improve user satisfaction with VR applications, it is of great significance to develop objective metrics for VIMS that can analyze and estimate the level of VR sickness when a user is exposed to VEs. One of the well-known objective metrics is the postural instability. In this paper, we trained a LSTM model for each participant using a normal-state postural signal captured before the exposure, and if the postural sway signal from post-exposure was sufficiently different from the pre-exposure signal, the model would fail at encoding and decoding the signal properly; the jump in the reconstruction error was called loss and was proposed as the proposed objective measure of simulator sickness. The effectiveness of the proposed metric was analyzed and compared with subjective assessment methods based on the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) in a VR environment, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of. 89. Finally, we showed that the proposed method had the potential to be deployed within a closed-loop system and get real-time performance to predict VR sickness, opening new insights to develop user-centered and customized VR applications based on physiological feedback.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798213","Human-centered computing;Virtual reality;Walkthrough evaluations;User interface design;Interaction devices;Computing methodologies;Machine learning;Machine learning approaches;Neural networks","Navigation;Virtual environments;Physiology;Real-time systems;Three-dimensional displays;Logic gates;Deep learning","closed loop systems;human factors;physiology;recurrent neural nets;virtual reality","VR sickness prediction;navigation;immersive virtual environments;deep long short term memory model;visually induced motion sickness;VIMS;VEs;physical environments;physiological symptoms;general discomfort;dizziness;fatigue;user satisfaction;VR applications;postural instability;LSTM model;normal-state postural signal;postural sway signal;post-exposure;pre-exposure signal;objective measure;simulator sickness questionnaire;VR environment;user-centered VR applications","","1","","34","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the learning curve of this technology from a novice level could influence the expected learning results of a training session. A training approach based on the combination of VR and gamification could speed up this overall learning process and not just for a novice. In this paper we evaluate how gamification in a VR training session can improve the efficiency of the training and the accuracy of the task execution in a real-world practical test. In the training scenario of this study, 50 randomly assigned participants were divided into two groups. The groups were assigned to a gamified and a non-gamified version of the same VR training and were then guided through a step-by-step tutorial outlining how to solve an assembly task. Performance differences were evaluated based on time taken and specific errors made during the training session. The results of this study show, in general, that beneficial effects can be attributed to the use of gamification in the conducted VR training simulation, particularly for the VR novice participants.","2474-0489","978-1-7281-4540-2","10.1109/VS-Games.2019.8864583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864583","virtual training;virtual reality;gamification;training;learning transfer;assembly task","Training;Task analysis;Games;Tutorials;Solid modeling;Augmented reality","computer based training;computer simulation;serious games (computing);virtual reality","VR simulation training;learning curve;novice level;gamification;learning process;VR training session;task execution;virtual reality training assembly task","","3","","44","","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the purpose of global scale selection, this article considers the virtual reality image in the global scope from the theoretical perspectives of the continuity of virtual reality images, the repeatability of virtual reality image features, the scale of scene virtual reality images in the global scope, and the visual saliency. This paper gives a general framework of multi-scale geometric analysis and particle swarm optimization virtual reality image matching algorithm. For the problem of virtual reality image matching, the original particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved. A more reasonable inertia weight change formula, a method for selecting the optimal solution when two objectives are optimized at the same time, and a method for selecting a reasonable input are designed. In this paper, performance evaluation experiments are performed on several feature description algorithms. The experimental results show that the descriptors constructed by these feature description algorithms are significantly more robust than SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors. The improved multi-scale geometric analysis and particle swarm optimization are robust due to the introduction of multiple support domains. It has the best discriminative ability, but at the same time, the introduction of multiple support domains leads to the worst real-time algorithm; DGOH (Dual Gradient Orientation Histogram) algorithm is more robust than FRDOH (Fast Repre-sentation Based on a Double Orientation Histogram) and SIFT algorithm, and DGOH algorithm has the best real-time performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133523","Virtual reality images;particle swarm optimization;multi-scale geometric analysis;inertial weights;feature description","Virtual reality;Feature extraction;Visualization;Particle swarm optimization;Optimization;Image matching","feature extraction;gradient methods;image matching;image motion analysis;image representation;particle swarm optimisation;transforms;virtual reality","feature description algorithms;SIFT descriptors;Scale Invariant Feature Transform;virtual reality image local features;virtual reality image local feature extraction techniques;global scale selection;scene virtual reality images;particle swarm optimization virtual reality image matching algorithm;virtual reality image technology;training optimization;motion microtime scale;target occlusion;visual saliency;inertia weight change formula;improved multiscale geometric analysis;dual gradient orientation histogram algorithm;FRDOH;fast representation based on a double orientation histogram;DGOH algorithm;performance evaluation experiments","","","","31","CCBY","6 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate clinical assessment of spasticity is critical in the determination of patient treatment, although physical evidence of spasticity is often confused with that of related neuromuscular disorders. By repeatably simulating different levels of spastic severity, we hope to improve clinician training for rating spasticity and consequently decrease the variability of ratings between raters and within raters. Our haptic device, designed to replicate the spastic elbow of a child, uses a brake actuator and high-resolution optical encoder. Two competing spasticity models from the literature are implemented. Preliminary experiments indicate that the decreased stretch reflex threshold model is more realistic than the increased stiffness model.

In a between-subjects experiment, 60 participants were trained to solve three 3D burr puzzles in one of six conditions comprised of virtual and physical training elements. In the four physical conditions, training was delivered via paper- and video-based instructions, with or without the physical puzzles to practice with. In the two virtual conditions, participants learnt to assemble the puzzles in an interactive virtual environment, with or without 3D animations showing the assembly process. After training, we conducted immediate tests in which participants were asked to solve a physical version of the puzzles. We measured performance through success rates and assembly completion testing times. We also measured training times as well as subjective ratings on several aspects of the experience. Our results show that the performance of virtually trained participants was promising. A statistically significant difference was not found between virtual training with animated instructions and the best performing physical condition (in which physical blocks were available during training) for the last and most complex puzzle in terms of success rates and testing times.

Method: Eighteen patients with stroke were enrolled in the Rehabilitation Medicine Department, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from December 2016 to August 2017. The patients were divided into observation group and control group by random number table. Both groups were trained in speech function. The observation group received regular speech training for 20 minutes per day, Virtual Reality (VR) training for 20 minutes per day; the control group was given conventional speech training 40 minutes per day but the same training content with the observation group. And both groups of patients were treated for 5 days per week lasting for 4 weeks. CRRCAE was used to evaluate the language ability before and after treatment. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, BDAE was used to assess the severity of aphasia. Bucco-facial-apraxia and speech apraxia Methods were used to assess the patient's state of bucco facial function and speech function. Result: There was no significant difference (P > 0.5) between the situations of two groups in general data, bucco-facial-apraxia and speech apraxia. Before treatment, the difference in CRRCAE and BDAE between the two groups is also not so big(P > 0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, the severity of aphasia was improved in both groups (P <; 0.05). Except computing ability, listening comprehension, repetition, expression, readout, reading, transcription, depiction and dictation were all improved (P <; 0.01).

A crane operator must be appropriately skilled to avoid any mishap at the construction site. This can be accomplished by training crane operators on all the safety procedures and methods of crane operation to be practiced. In this paper we explore a method whereby anyone who is being trained as a crane operator, must first learn all the operational procedures and safety norms by playing a simulation of operating a crane in a serious game. Once the user successfully completes the different levels of this serious game, he can then 'graduate' to operate an actual crane. Serious games are proven method of cost effective and risk free simulated environments where a player can learn all the nuances of any simulated activity, herein operating a crane. We implemented a learning methodology, Gagne's 9 Events of Learning, in order to ensure the player develops a high level of understanding. We used an actual crane as a reference model (Ace14XW) for this game. We surveyed several crane operators and found that this crane model game enhanced their knowledge of handling and precautionary measures. The users also reported an increased confidence level while operating a real crane.","","978-1-5090-6115-0","10.1109/T4E.2016.030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814805","Unity3D;Animations;Crane Simulation;Mobile crane;Simulator;Training system;Serious Game;Gagne's 9 events model","Cranes;Games;Training;Solid modeling;Mobile communication;Accidents;Vehicles","computer aided instruction;cranes;digital simulation;serious games (computing)","crane operator training;serious game;crane simulator;large scale construction related activity;safety procedures;risk free simulated environments;Gagne's 9 events of learning;learning methodology","","2","","12","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being present in an operating room allows students to deepen their understanding of various surgical procedures while giving them an opportunity to experience the hands-on environment and general atmosphere. However, traditional instruction methods through observation contain many disadvantages that make learning surgical procedures difficult and problematic. For example, during long sessions of endoscopic surgery, the pictures taken display only a small portion of the internal body, making it difficult for students to fully understand the details of the entire process. Locating the positions of internal organs and understanding the direction of instrument movement is also inconvenient. However, with the aid of a virtual reality support system, students can learn through real-time interactive demonstrations of the surgical process that include details about operating position and other specificities. The result is increased accessibility to facilitate the understanding of the entire surgery process coupled with the reduction of fatigue and other distractions that arise from prolonged observation in a traditional operating room.

This has led to significant effort toward improving safety records, particularly in the fields of flight crew training and in-flight support technologies that aid better decision-making, as well as for training the management of reactions to a startling occurrence. One way to achieve quality decision-making in the cockpit is by providing adequate cueing and response activating mechanisms carefully designed to aid human information processing. Furthermore, these response performances, especially in the context of reactionary management of startle in-flight, could be honed through simulator based training. This paper describes the simulation environment developed as well as its key characteristics which enable such a simulation experiment in the general aviation domain.

It can simulate the surgery from the visual, auditory, and tactile aspects. VR medical simulator can greatly reduce the risk of the real patient and the cost of hospitals. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the typical representatives in minimal invasive surgery (MIS). Due to the large incidence of cholecystectomy, the application of its VR-based simulation is vital and necessary for the residents' surgical training. In this paper, we present a VR simulation framework based on position-based dynamics (PBD) for cholecystectomy. To further accelerate the deformation of organs, PBD constraints are solved in parallel by a graph coloring algorithm. We introduce a bio-thermal conduction model to improve the realism of the fat tissue electrocautery. Finally, we design a hybrid multi-model connection method to handle the interaction and simulation of the liver-gallbladder separation. This simulation system has been applied to laparoscopic cholecystectomy training in several hospitals. From the experimental results, users can operate in real-time with high stability and fidelity. The simulator is also evaluated by a number of digestive surgeons through preliminary studies.

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","computer aided instruction;computer animation;computer science education;solid modelling;student experiments;training;Turing machines;virtual reality","virtual experiments;virtual reality technology;introduction to computing;public course;student training;computer science;computational thinking;teaching contents;Turing machine;computer organization;3D modeling;animation;human-machine interaction;demonstration experiments;verification experiments;interaction experiments;software copyrights;teaching effectiveness;learning efficiency","","5","","10","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter training-scenarios development times and reuse of existing engineering models. In addition, by using computer based virtual reality (VR) training systems, the time span from the product design to commercial production can be shortened due to non-reliance on hardware parts. Within the aforementioned conceptual framework, a haptically enabled interactive and immersive virtual reality (HIIVR) system is presented. Unlike existing VR systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations of the real world imposed by the haptics devices within the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VR systems, capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in procedural learning and procedural skill development as well, due to its high physically interactive nature.","2154-4824","978-1-889335-38-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699035","Haptics;virtual assembly;interactive and immersive","Virtual reality;Virtual prototyping;Assembly;Industrial training;Computer aided manufacturing;Manufacturing industries;Costs;Design engineering;Product design;Production systems","assembling;computer based training;haptic interfaces;industrial training;production engineering computing;virtual reality","haptically enabled interactive virtual reality prototype;general assembly;manufacturing industries;computer-based virtual reality training systems;immersive virtual reality","","","","9","","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rehabilitation is the main therapeutic approach for reducing poststroke functional deficits but significant variability exists between patients regarding rehabilitation efficacy. Because the recovery mechanisms induced by rehabilitation are not fully understood, it is still not clear which treatment approaches and techniques are most beneficial. Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-based environment that provides the users an immersive experience of a synthetic world and allows a systemic testing of human functions under the simulated environment of controllable parameters. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of VR based rehabilitation for improving the upper limb functional recovery. However, the question which components in the VR game are most valuable for promoting the recovery has not been examined. This study aims to identify the motion kinetics extracted from the VR based rehabilitation that are significantly correlated with the functional improvement. Twenty-one stroke patients were recruited and received 1 hour rehabilitation with the intensity of 3 times per week over 8 weeks, in total 24 training sessions, using a home-made VR program. All patients underwent the evaluation of their function before and after rehabilitation by Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA). The parameters of human kinetics, such as speed/max speed, velocity and trajectory during VR-based rehabilitation were recorded digitally and the changes of the kinetics after finishing 24 training sessions were then correlated with the post-rehabilitation changes of FMA. The statistic result showed that the increase of efficiency, speed stability and straightness of trajectory leads to a better functional improvement, in addition to the increase of palm strength. In conclusion, the changes of the improvement-related motor kinetics could serve as guidance when designing the individualized treatment strategy.","","978-1-5090-4897-7","10.1109/ICASI.2017.7988517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988517","virtual reality (VR) based rehabilitation;Kinematic Features;individualized treatment","Kinetic theory;Virtual reality;Games;Training;Trajectory;Extremities;Conferences","medical computing;patient treatment;virtual reality","improvement related motor kinetics;virtual reality;rehabilitation;stroke;adult disability;stroke survivors;motor deficits;upper limb;UL;therapeutic approach;post stroke functional;recovery mechanisms;computer based environment;synthetic world;human functions;simulated environment;controllable parameters;upper limb functional recovery;VR game;motion kinetics extraction;Fugl-Meyer assessment;FMA;human kinetics;individualized treatment strategy","","1","","17","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We call this the mixed reality (MR) simulation approach. However, the validity of MR simulation, especially when different simulator platforms are used, can be questioned. In this paper, we report the results of an experiment examining the effects of field of regard (FOR) and head tracking on the analysis of volume visualized micro-CT datasets, and compare them with those from a previous study. The original study used a CAVE-like display as the MR simulator platform, while the present study used a high-end head-mounted display (HMD). Out of the 24 combinations of system characteristics and tasks tested on the two platforms, we found that the results produced by the two different MR simulators were similar in 20 cases. However, only one of the significant effects found in the original experiment for quantitative tasks was reproduced in the present study. Our observations provide evidence both for and against the validity of MR simulation, and give insight into the differences caused by different MR simulator platforms. The present experiment also examined new conditions not present in the original study, and produced new significant results, which confirm and extend previous existing knowledge on the effects of FOR and head tracking.

However, the use of virtual reality tools does not provide a complete sense of realism for the trainees, so the topical problem is to develop and integrate into the training complexes various simulation systems that increase the degree of human immersion into the virtual world. In this study the problem of simulation of physical loads and realistic movement of the user in the virtual world is considered. In order to solve it, it is proposed to develop a universal software and hardware platform based on an automated treadmill, which allows organizing the user's natural movement in a virtual environment with the ability to programmatically control various movement parameters, such as speed and incline of the running belt. Thus, it is required to implement the software of the control system, as well as the algorithmic support necessary for its work for the realization of these functions. This paper considers the general scheme of functioning of the software and hardware platform, its hardware and software components, as well as the algorithm of controlling the hardware actuating elements of the platform. The results were applied in the implementation of the control system of the software and hardware platform to ensure its correct functioning.

As well as displaying the mastoid bone through volume rendering, the simulation allows users to experience haptic feedback and appropriate sound cues while controlling a virtual bone drill and suction/irrigation device. The techniques employed to improve realism consist of a fluid simulator and a shading model. The former allows for deformable boundaries based on volumetric bone data, while the latter gives a wet look to the rendered bone to emulate more closely the appearance of the bone in a surgical environment.

This paper presents a simulator that specifically addresses the intermodal conflict between motor actuation and visual feedback. We developed a virtual reality visio-haptic simulator to assist surgical residents in training to resolve visio-motor conflict. The developed simulator offers individuals the flexibility to train in various scenarios with different levels of visio-motor conflicts. The levels of conflict were simulated by creating a linear functional relation between movement in the real environment and the virtual environment. The haptic rendering was consistent with the visual feedback. Experiments were conducted with expert pediatric surgeons and general surgery residents. Baseline data on performance in conditions of visio-motor conflict were assimilated from expert surgeons. Residents were divided into experimental group that was exposed to visio-motor conflict and the control group which wasnpsilat exposed to visio-motor conflict training. When the performance was compared on a standard surgical suturing task, the residents with inter-modal conflict training performed better than the control group suggesting the construct validity of the training and that visio-motor training can accelerate learning.","","978-1-4244-2668-3","10.1109/HAVE.2008.4685290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685290","Virtual Reality;Medical Simulation;Haptic User Interfaces;Surgical Simulation","Virtual reality;Minimally invasive surgery;Feedback;Humans;Cameras;Haptic interfaces;Medical simulation;Ergonomics;Biological system modeling;Patient monitoring","computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;rendering (computer graphics);surgery;virtual reality","virtual reality based training;visio-motor conflicts;surgical environments;minimally invasive surgery;visual feedback;linear functional relation;haptic rendering;visio-motor training","","3","","10","","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this study was to determine a metrics of distance perception in VEs and whether this metrics depends on interactive factors: stereoscopy and motion parallax. After a training session, participants were asked, while driving, to estimate the relative location (5 to 80 m) of a car on the same road. The overall results suggest that distance perception in this range does not depend on interactive factors. In average, as generally reported, subjects underestimated the distances whatever the vision conditions. However, the study revealed a large interpersonal variability: two profiles of participants were defined, those who quite accurately perceived distances in VR and those who underestimated distances as usually reported. Overall, this classification was correlated to the level of performance of participants during the training phase.

Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter times for the development of different training-scenarios as well as reuse of existing designed engineering (math) models. This paper presents a newly developed virtual environment (VE) for training of procedure tasks i.e. object assembly. Unlike existing VE systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations of the real world. These physical constrains are imposed by the haptics devices in the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VE systems that are capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in cognitive learning and procedural skill development due to its high physically interactive nature. In addition a novel evaluation framework has also been proposed to evaluate system efficacy through a large scale of user-testing, which is often been neglected by design experts in the field of VEs. Results confirm the practical significance of evaluating a VE design by involving sample of real and representative users through the effective discovery of critical usability problems and system deficiencies. Results also indicate benefits of collecting multimodal information for accurate and comprehensive assessment of system efficacy. Evaluation results and improvement of existing design are also presented.","","978-1-4244-4217-1","10.1109/HAVE.2009.5356130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356130","Virtual environment;Training;User-ecntred evaluation;Performance;Perception;Memory","Virtual environment;Assembly systems;Industrial training;Haptic interfaces;Manufacturing industries;Costs;Usability;Computer aided manufacturing;Feedback;Intelligent manufacturing systems","assembling;computer based training;haptic interfaces;human factors;industrial training;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;virtual reality","virtual environment;object assembly training;virtual training systems;manufacturing industry;user interaction;haptics devices;user-testing;user-centered evaluation;cognitive learning;procedural skill development","","7","","16","","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results show that subjects performed best with small-size-simple structures and large-size-complex structures in VR. Movement execution was generally faster and more precise on simple structures. Performance was less precise when the dominant hand was used to follow the complex structures and small object size in VR. It is concluded that both size and structural complexity critically influence task execution in VR when no tactile feed-back from object to finger is generated.

However, surgical VR-training is still limited to minimal invasive surgeries. For surgeries where high forces occur, like hip replacement, no VR-training applications have been developed. One cause for this is the lack of appropriate haptic devices which can deliver high forces. Novel industrial collaborative robots can provide high forces. Although, they lack control interfaces allowing to use them as haptic devices. We present 4 approaches for using these robots as general, multipurpose haptic input and output devices. The implemented approach was integrated into a VR hip replacement training application. An initial assessment demonstrates the general feasibility of our solution.","","978-1-5386-3365-6","10.1109/VR.2018.8446614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8446614","Haptics;Industrial robot;Virtual reality;Surgery;Medicine;Training;Applied computing → Life and medical sciences;Human-centered computing → Virtual reality;Human-centered computing → Haptic devices","Conferences;Virtual reality;Three-dimensional displays;User interfaces","haptic interfaces;industrial robots;medical robotics;prosthetics;surgery;virtual reality","surgical VR-training;VR hip replacement training application;haptic devices;industrial collaborative robots","","6","","7","","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Design of Practical Information Multidimensional Integration System for Higher Vocational Ideological and Political Courses Facing Big Data","X. Ding",Suzhou Polytechnic Institute of Agriculture,"2019 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Intelligent Systems (ICVRIS)","5 Dec 2019","2019","","","386","390","In view of the fact that the current information integration system can not quickly integrate a large number of chaotic practical information, this paper designs a multi-dimensional integration system of practical information for ideological and political courses in higher vocational colleges. The main control chip, TMS320C6748, is used to control the whole operation of the system. The physical server stores the information data and communicates with the serial port to transfer the data. Through the method of FPGA, the cluttered practical information data is filtered. According to the principle of Bayesian algorithm, the filtered information data is classified and the information data is preprocessed. In the SQL database, XML technology is used to parse and transform the pre-processed information and data. The data transformed into XML format is unified. According to the set multi-dimensional integration rules, data streams are split in the middle layer of the database and then merged is omorphically and heterogeneously. The data is loaded and stored in the integrated database, and finally the integration of information and data is completed. The design of multi-dimensional integration system is completed through hardware and software design. Comparing with the current information integration system, the experiment verifies the speed of information integration time of the designed multi-dimensional integration system. When integrating different amounts of practical information, the integration time of the designed multi-dimensional integration system is about one third of that of the current information integration system.","","978-1-7281-5050-5","10.1109/ICVRIS.2019.00100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920804","big data;higher vocational ideological and political course;multidimensional integration;system design","Databases;XML;Servers;Information filters;Big Data;Education","Big Data;computer aided instruction;data analysis;data mining;digital signal processing chips;educational courses;educational institutions;field programmable gate arrays;SQL;vocational training;XML","cluttered practical information data;filtered information data;pre-processed information;set multidimensional integration rules;data streams;integrated database;current information integration system;information integration time;designed multidimensional integration system;practical information multidimensional integration system;political courses facing big data;chaotic practical information","","","","10","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transmission channel can be modeled by an artificial neural network to reduce the computational complexity compared to the analysis using full-wave simulation programs (CST, HFSS, etc.). Two neural network architectures were selected (a feed-forward one and a radial basis function one) to model an in-car transmission channel.

The VDC would become the next generation design tool for engineering, software, hardware, and system design. The VVC would become the next generation remote monitoring and control operation. Day care centers where children of working parents usually spend their time can be easily networked together so that the working parents can talk and see their children from remote locations. The VVC would also help monitor elderly persons in nursing homes. The elderly people do not have to be isolated, but be active members in the interactive audio and video based VVC. The authors present the hardware and software requirements of the VDC and WC realizations. The operational models of the VDC and WC are also discussed with the associated results.

The task in the experiment was to minimize the time to transfer a frame through a rod with no collisions. The performance of human subjects was measured and analyzed quantitatively as a function of network latency and packet loss rate. The experiment results show that the delay had little effect on the task performance while the network latency was less than 200 ms and it was acceptable while the network latency was less than 500 ms; the packet loss had no effect on the task performance while there were 20 state update messages received and it was acceptable while there were more than 10 state update messages received.","","0-7803-7941-1","10.1109/CACWD.2004.1349000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1349000","","Intelligent networks;Performance loss;Collaboration;Industrial training;Virtual environment;Delay effects;Navigation;Educational institutions;Computer science;Collaborative work","groupware;virtual reality;computer networks;delays;digital simulation;user interfaces","network characteristics;cooperation performance;desktop CVE system;collaborative virtual environment;shared virtual objects;network emulator;network simulation;network latency;packet loss rate;state update messages","","1","","11","","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eng., City Coll. of New York, NY, USA; NA; NA","MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","6 Aug 2002","1997","1","","493","497 vol.1","It is known that some types of variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic exhibit strong long term correlations and non-stationary behavior. Estimation of an accurate amount of bandwidth to support this traffic has been a challenging task using conventional algorithmic approaches. We show that radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) are capable of learning the non-linear multi-dimensional mapping between different video traffic patterns, quality of service (QoS) requirements and the required bandwidth to support each call. In addition, the RBFNN model adopts to new traffic scenarios and still produces accurate results. This approach bypass the modeling approach which requires detailed knowledge about the traffic statistical patterns. Our method employs ""on-line"" measurements of the traffic count process over a monitoring period. In order to simplify the design of the RBFNN, the input traffic is preprocessed through a lowpass filter in order to smooth all high frequency fluctuations. A large set of training data, representing different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, was used to ensure that the RBFNN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new data. The reported results prove that the neurocomputing approach is effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods, based upon mathematical or simulation analysis. This is primarily due to the fact that the unique learning and adaptive capabilities of NN enable them to extract and memorize rules from previous experience.","","0-7803-4249-6","10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=648770","","Bandwidth;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Bit rate;Radial basis function networks;Monitoring;Data preprocessing;Filters;Frequency","asynchronous transfer mode;telecommunication networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);adaptive systems;visual communication","bandwidth estimation;ATM networks;RBF neural network;variable bit rate;VBR video traffic;long term correlations;nonstationary behavior;radial basis function neural networks;nonlinear multi-dimensional mapping;video traffic patterns;quality of service;QoS requirements;RBFNN model;on-line measurements;traffic count process;input traffic;lowpass filter;training dat;HF fluctuations smoothing;neurocomputing approach;adaptive capabilities;rules","","","","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years the idea of using video game technology in surgical education for laparoscopy has also been explored, however few have attempted to make a connection between video game experience and robotic surgical skills. Thus, the current study aims to examine the performance of video gamers in a virtual reality robotic surgery simulator. Furthermore, the video gamers' performance was compared to that of medical students, expert robotic surgeons, and “laypeople.” The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that video gamers acquire perceptual and psychomotor skills through video game play, similar to those used by robotic surgeons. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and performed three computer-based perceptual tests: a Flanker compatibility task, a subsidizing task, and a Multiple Object Tracking test. Participants then performed two warm-up exercises and eight trials of two core exercises on a robotic surgery simulator. After completing all trials, participants completed a post-questionnaire regarding their experience with the system. Expert video gamers (n=40), medical students (n=24), laypeople (n=42) and expert robotic surgeons (n=16) were recruited. Medical students and gamers were significantly faster than experts in the Flanker Task. The experts were significantly slower than the all other groups in the subsidizing task. Experts scored significantly higher, were significantly more efficient, and were significantly faster than laypeople, medical students, and gamers in the first trial of Ring & Rail 1 and Suture Sponge. In trial eight of the simulation exercises, the experts performed significantly better than most groups in all of the metrics. Contrary to prior literature in laparoscopy, this study was unable to validate enhanced abilities of video gamers in a robotic surgery simulator. This study does further demonstrate that the transfer of skills developed through video game play is relevant to the surgical technique. This may be due to the differences of the systems and how the users interact within them. In a society where video games have become an integral past time, it is important to determine the role that video games play in the perceptual and psychomotor development of users. These findings can be generalized to domains outside of medicine that utilize robotic and computer-controlled systems, speaking to the scope of the gamers' abilities and pointing to the capacity within these systems.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586262","","Surgery;Robots;Measurement;Games;Training;Rails;Cameras","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational robots;human-robot interaction;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery;virtual reality","video game experience;basic robotic skills;virtual reality robotic surgery simulator;standardized robotic surgery skill training;objective robotic surgery skill training;standardized robotic surgery skill assessment;objective robotic surgery skill assessment;surgical education;laparoscopy;video game technology;perceptual skill acquisition;psychomotor skill acquisition;computer-based perceptual tests;flanker compatibility task;subsidizing task;multiple object tracking test;computer-controlled systems","","1","","17","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate a simulated reaching task by training controllers under prenatal conditions (i.e. confined space) and evaluating them based on postnatal conditions (i.e. targets outside of the confined training space). One possible solution is to identify a sensory representation that is easy to extrapolate over. We compared two kinds of sensory representations: world-centered sensory representation based on Cartesian coordinates and agent-centered sensory representation based on polar coordinates. Despite similar performance under prenatal conditions, controllers using agent-centered sensory representation had significantly better performance than controllers using world-centered sensory representation under postnatal conditions. It turns out that the success of the agent-centered sensory representation is (in part) due to being complementary to the action encodings. Further analysis shows that the action encodings (i.e. changes in joint angles) were highly predictive of the change in state when agent-centered sensory representation was used (but not world-centered). This suggests that a powerful strategy for transferring sensory-motor skills to postnatal life involves selecting a sensory representation that complements the action encodings used by an agent.","2161-9476","978-1-4244-6902-4","10.1109/DEVLRN.2010.5578844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578844","","Joints;Optical wavelength conversion;Training;Elbow;Shoulder;Encoding;Fetus","biomechanics;cognition;medical computing;obstetrics;paediatrics","prenatal transfer;postnatal transfer;motor skills;motor-compatible sensory representations;sensory-motor skills;fetus;reaching task;extrapolation;Cartesian coordinates;agent-centered sensory representation;action encodings","","4","","18","","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these open problems, we develop a multi-level architecture that enables device intelligence, edge intelligence, and cloud intelligence for URLLC. The basic idea is to merge theoretical models and realworld data in analyzing the latency and reliability and training deep neural networks (DNNs). Deep transfer learning is adopted in the architecture to fine-tune the pre-trained DNNs in non-stationary networks.

A Cafero touchscreen robot took the patient's vital signs prior to the consultation and transferred the results to the medical professional's computer. Time-savings were calculated in New Zealand dollar terms and compared to the costs of the robot and its maintenance. Results showed that consultation lengths were cut by 18% on average (3 minutes and 13 seconds). If 20% of the clinics' annual consultations were augmented with the robot this translates to a total annual savings of NZ$19075. The annual cost of the robot was calculated to be NZ$9400 overs 5 years. Present value calculations of Benefit Cost result in a Benefit Cost ratio of 2.3. These results support the cost-effectiveness of the robot in a rural medical clinic.

It combines the existing actual hardware laboratory and the remote laboratory, with newly designed CAD services and FPGA-run services realized in the form of the Web Services. A Cloud-storage is employed to transfer large CAD files and simulation data files among laboratory FPGA-Platforms and student laptop/desktop home PCs. Design Files can be shared among students, TAs and Teachers for further consultations. Students can easily migrate from actual laboratory to remote laboratory and vice versa. The Cyber laboratory takes advantage of student PCs' active participations in the remote laboratory mode to off-load time consuming tasks, such as logic simulation, from actual laboratory's FPGA-design platforms. It is also effective to avoid network latency and to improve interactive response. Cyber laboratory uses commercial Verilog-HDL logic synthesis tools, FPGA Test-beds and logic analyzers, those are tightly integrated into specific hardware platforms and difficult to decouple. So, actual laboratory organization is still plays an important role in the remote laboratory mode. CAD Web services and FPGA-run Web services are developed to combine remote student PCs with actual laboratory FPGA-Platforms. Those handle compilation, FPGA-run and logic analyzer setup/measure tasks in the form of the Web services. As the laboratory FPGA-Platforms have to serve in two ways: actual laboratory services and remote laboratory services, two separate Virtual Machines are prepared for all laboratory PCs in the form of VM PC clusters. A VM managing PC handles the allocations of VMs to laboratory PCs, according to the usage of PCs.

In collaboration with engineers and doctors from Milan and Beijing, it is to realize an active device that performs function adapting perfectly to the anatomical characteristics of each subject, and it would supply greater possibilities and flexibility. Traditional devices are passive rigid orthoses (AFO) and active peroneal stimulation systems (FES). Although simple and cheap, AFO system can bring about phenomena of adaptation at the central level that gradually decrease muscle activity over time. More is the stiffness in the path. FES devices ensure a more natural movement of the foot but without control autonomy. Moreover, the efficiency is always limited with high costs.

We train the model with as many types of signals as possible as well as noise data to enable the trained network model to adapt to untrained new signals. We also use transfer learning strategies to improve the performance for real-world signals. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of this method. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than two traditional spectrum sensing methods, i.e., maximum-minimum eigenvalue ratio-based method and frequency domain entropy-based method. In addition, the experimental results of the new untrained signal types show that our method can adapt to the detection of these new signals. Furthermore, the real-world signal detection experiment results show that the detection performance can be further improved by transfer learning. Finally, experiments under colored noise show that our proposed method has superior detection performance under colored noise, while the traditional methods have a significant performance degradation, which further validate the superiority of our method.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2020.02.012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9020304","spectrum sensing;deep learning;convolutional neural network;cognitive radio;spectrum management","Sensors;Machine learning;Training;Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Cognitive radio;Uncertainty","cognitive radio;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;entropy;learning (artificial intelligence);radio spectrum management;signal classification;signal denoising;signal detection;telecommunication computing","deep learning classification;received signal power;noise power uncertainty;noise data;trained network model;transfer learning strategies;untrained signal types;real-world signal detection experiment results;cognitive radios;classification problem","","3","","","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Rate regulation with feedback controller in ATM networks-a neural network approach","Y. -. Liu; C. Douligeris","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Miami Univ., Coral Gables, FL, USA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","6 Aug 2002","1997","15","2","200","208","We propose the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) technique for a rate-based feedback controller in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. A leaky bucket (LB) mechanism is used for cell discarding, when the traffic violates a predefined threshold. Since the network cannot rely on the user's compliance with its declared parameters, it is extremely difficult to select the best threshold value and depletion rate for the LB. We propose an ANN model which monitors the status of the LB and predicts the possible cell discarding at the LB in the near future. The source rate is regulated to a certain amount depending on the feedback signal ""strength"" when possible cell discarding is detected. The lower the value carried in the feedback cell, the higher the possibility of cell discarding and, subsequently, the higher the probability that the traffic is regulated to a lower rate. Our model considers the propagation delay time of the feedback signal making our approach more realistic. This mechanism is transparent to the source if the LB is correctly set up and the traffic follows its declared parameters. We use the same trained ANN for different MPEG traces and the results of a simulation study suggest that our mechanisms provide simple and effective traffic management for ATM networks. Cell loss rate due to the congestion shows a two to five times improvement compared with the static approach, while transmission delays introduced by our ANN controller are also smaller than in the static approach. Channel utilization is also improved, showing that our mechanisms provides a better alternative to static feedback controllers.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.552070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=552070","","Adaptive control;Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Traffic control;Asynchronous transfer mode;Communication system traffic control;Artificial neural networks;Switches;B-ISDN;Predictive models","asynchronous transfer mode;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;controllers;delays;telecommunication network management;feedforward neural nets;backpropagation","feedback controller;rate regulation;ATM networks;ANN;artificial neural network;depletion rate;threshold value;ANN model;cell discarding;source rate;feedback signal strength;feedback cell;propagation delay time;traffic parameters;MPEG traces;simulation study;traffic management;cell loss rate;congestion;channel utilization;feedforward error backpropagation network","","31","5","23","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, an accurate estimation of instantaneous channel transfer function, i.e., channel state information (CSI), is needed in order for the transmitter DNN to learn to optimize the receiver gain in decoding. This is very much a challenge since CSI varies with time and location in wireless communications and is hard to obtain when designing transceivers. We propose to use a conditional generative adversarial net (GAN) to represent channel effects and to bridge the transmitter DNN and the receiver DNN so that the gradient of the transmitter DNN can be back-propagated from the receiver DNN. In particular, a conditional GAN is employed to model the channel effects in a data-driven way, where the received signal corresponding to the pilot symbols is added as a part of the conditioning information of the GAN. To address the curse of dimensionality when the transmit symbol sequence is long, convolutional layers are utilized. From the simulation results, the proposed method is effective on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, Rayleigh fading channels, and frequency-selective channels, which opens a new door for building data-driven DNNs for end-to-end communication systems.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2020.2970707","Intel Corporation; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985539","Channel GAN;CNN;end-to-end communication system;channel coding","Gallium nitride;Transmitters;Receivers;Wireless communication;Training;Maximum likelihood decoding","AWGN channels;channel estimation;error statistics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio transceivers;Rayleigh channels;telecommunication computing;transfer functions","convolutional layers;AWGN channels;end-to-end wireless communication systems;conditional generative adversarial net;decoding;receiver gain;CSI;channel state information;instantaneous channel transfer function;key functions;deep neural networks;unknown channels;deep learning;data-driven DNNs;frequency-selective channels;Rayleigh fading channels;additive white Gaussian noise channels;conditioning information;received signal;channel effects;conditional GAN;receiver DNN;transmitter DNN","","9","","38","CCBY","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new paradigm which is called Software Defined Systems (SDSys) comes as a solution to reduce the overhead of datacenters management by abstracting all the control functionalities from the hardware devices and setting it inside a software layer. These functionalities are responsible for organizing and controlling the main blocks of the datacenter; network, storage, compute and security. The Software Defined Datacenter (SDD) integrates the software defined concepts into all of these main blocks. Transferring these concepts into workable systems requires checking several performance aspects and testing its correctness before building real systems. In this paper we introduce a novel experimental framework (SDDC) to provide a novel virtualized testbed environment for SDD systems. This work builds on the Mininet simulator, where its core components, the host, the switch and the controller, are customized to build the proposed experimental simulation framework for SDD. This simulator lets the users develop and test their own SDD solutions, and at the same time gives the researchers an experimentation tool for benchmarking purposes.

For synthesizing personalized medicine, it is critical to prepare customized samples with specific concentrations by microfluidic biochips because of the advantages in saving costly reagents and rare samples. The current state-of-the-art of concentration generation for microfluidic biochips is to construct a database by random design methods. However, due to the complex multidimentional parameters such as molecule diameters, inlets, outlets, etc, the whole process is error prone and time consuming. To speedup database construction and reduce the errors in concentration generation, this paper proposes the first transfer learning-based method based on an artificial neural network model (ANN). Given an initial ANN model, transfer learning method can fine-tune weights of ANN to obtain all ANN models needed in the database, which can significantly reduce the amount of required training data. Computational simulation results show that the time for database construction is reduced from several months to 2 days, and the query error is reduced by 83% compared with the existing method.","0738-100X","978-1-7281-1085-1","10.1109/DAC18072.2020.9218722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218722","Microfluidic biochips;Concentration generation;Transfer learning","","learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;microfluidics;neural nets;physiology;random processes","database construction;concentration generation;artificial neural network model;ANN models;transfer learning-based microfluidic design system;specific concentrations;microfluidic biochips;random design methods;complex multidimentional parameters;personalized medicine synthesis","","","","21","","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the placement of implants is not without risk due to anatomically complex operation sites in the cranio-maxillofacial region. Therefore, in the field of oral implantology, there is a trend towards computer-aided implant surgery. In this study, an integrated surgical planning and virtual training system is presented. With the introduction of DLL (Dynamic Link Libraries) and some well-known free, open source software libraries such as VTK, ITK, and QT, a modular software named CAPPOIS (Computer Assisted Preoperative Planning for Oral Implant Surgery) was developed for preoperative planning, including medical image importing, image segmentation and 3D-Reconstruction, 2D/3D geometrical measurements, optimization design of the position and orientation of oral implants, etc. Then, the following virtual surgical training system is developed based on the force feedback haptic device, i.e., Omega.3, and the software toolkit of CHAI3D. With the use of this system, the resulting data of the preoperative planning can be transferred, and surgical simulation of the plan can be vividly realized. In this way, the surgeon can grasp the feel of osteotomy procedure, gain experience and therefore improve his skills during the actual dental implant surgery. This pilot study proves helpful for the inexperienced surgeons; however, more clinical cases will be conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and reliability.","","978-1-4244-5858-5","10.1109/ICALIP.2010.5685115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685115","","Surgery;Implants;Solid modeling;Planning;Three dimensional displays;Training;Software","dentistry;force feedback;haptic interfaces;medical computing;prosthetics;software libraries","integrated surgical planning;virtual training system;force feedback haptic device;dental implant surgery;cranio-maxillofacial region;oral implantology;computer-aided implant surgery;DLL;dynamic link libraries;open source software libraries;VTK;ITK;QT;CAPPOIS;computer assisted preoperative planning;oral implant surgery;osteotomy procedure","","7","","12","","10 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our system makes use of a (i) a neural network that can be trained to recognize normal limb movements (for individual patients), which may then be coupled to (ii) a physical grid mattress that can be used in the patient's home. Any changes in the patient's movement could potentially indicate that stroke has occurred are transmitted to a mobile phone app. The latter in turn alerts a relative or ambulance to render rapid assistance to the individual. When stroke has occurred it is essential to transfer the patient to hospital very quickly in order that treatment can be given promptly. In the case of strokes that have arisen due to a blood clot in the cerebral circulation of the brain, a drug called Alteplase (an anti-thrombolytic) must be given within 4.5 hours of the stroke occurring to be maximally effective. Therefore it is important to know the exact time on stroke onset. Our system would record the time of onset of the stroke, by recognizing and recording abnormal changes in the individual's limb movements.

However, due to the extremely dynamic nature of MANETs, it is not possible to determine a set of weights that are appropriate for all contexts. In this paper, an Automated Trust Management (ATM) system is described for MANETs that uses a support vector machine classifier to detect malicious MANET nodes. The ATM scheme is resilient to attempts by a malicious MANET node to hide its nature by varying its misbehavior patterns over time. The performance of the ATM scheme is evaluated via an extensive simulation study and compared with existing approaches.","2375-0324","978-0-7695-4436-6","10.1109/MDM.2011.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6068451","security;trust management;mobile ad hoc network;support vector machine","Ad hoc networks;Asynchronous transfer mode;Mobile computing;Support vector machines;Mobile communication;Training;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","automated trust management;mobile ad-hoc network;MANET;trust management scheme;support vector machine classifier","","3","","8","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the performance of a classifier constructed from an instructed sign is significantly better than that of dynamic time warping (DTW) with the same sign.

Based on the number of calls in each class, the NNCAC efficiently and accurately estimates the cell delay and cell loss ratio of each class in real time by means of a pre-trained neural network. According to our decent study which exhibits the superiority of the employment of analysis-based training data over simulation-based data, we particularly construct the training data from heterogeneous-arrival dual-class queueing model M/sup [N1]/+I/sup [N2]//D/1/K, where M and I represent the Bernoulli process and interrupted Bernoulli process, and N/sub 1/ and N/sub 2/ represent the corresponding numbers of calls, respectively.

The best existing robot planners are based on random sampling of configuration space- which becomes excessively high-dimensional with large number of objects. Consequently, most planners often fail to efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract the decision making, irrespective of the number of obstacles. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of waypoints in task space. These waypoints provided a high-level plan, which could be transferred to an arbitrary robot model and used to initialise a local trajectory optimiser. We evaluated this approach through testing on unseen human VR data, a physics-based robot simulation, and a real robot (dataset and code are publicly available1). We found that the human-like planner outperformed a state-of-the-art standard trajectory optimisation algorithm, and was able to generate effective strategies for rapid planning- irrespective of the number of obstacles in the environment.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196665","","Task analysis;Planning;Robots;Testing;Feature extraction;Trajectory;Standards","collision avoidance;decision making;dexterous manipulators;grippers;learning (artificial intelligence);planning (artificial intelligence);robot programming;robot vision;trajectory control;virtual reality","decision making;decision classifiers;cluttered environments;robot planners;random sampling;object manipulation plans;virtual reality;trajectory optimisation;physics based robot simulation;human-like planning;depth camera;Robotiq two finger gripper","","","","31","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Haptic feedback has been proposed as a means to provide additional guidance cues that might improve training efficacy; however, recent studies have identified drawbacks to haptic guidance, including reliance on guidance forces and an inability to distinguish between forces that are part of the virtual environment and those that communicate task completion strategies. Recently, we proposed a novel approach to providing haptic guidance that separates task and guidance forces. We used a kinesthetic haptic interface to communicate task forces and a spatially separated tactile skin-stretch device to transmit guidance forces. Our experiments showed that feed-forward control using this paradigm was effective for improving performance in a trajectory following task. In this paper, we explore the potential for spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance to train a user to optimally control an inverted pendulum system. We present and execute a task and training protocol designed to determine whether error-based haptic feedback provided cutaneously can accelerate learning of a task, and whether participants can retain or transfer task skills even after guidance is no longer present. We found that subject performance improved while spatially separated cutaneous haptic guidance was active.

Recently, various synthetic environments have been introduced to facilitate research in embodied AI. Notwithstanding this progress, the crucial question of how well models trained in simulation generalize to reality has remained largely unanswered. The creation of a comparable ecosystem for simulation-to-real embodied AI presents many challenges: (1) the inherently interactive nature of the problem, (2) the need for tight alignments between real and simulated worlds, (3) the difficulty of replicating physical conditions for repeatable experiments, (4) and the associated cost. In this paper, we introduce RoboTHOR to democratize research in interactive and embodied visual AI. RoboTHOR offers a framework of simulated environments paired with physical counterparts to systematically explore and overcome the challenges of simulation-to-real transfer, and a platform where researchers across the globe can remotely test their embodied models in the physical world. As a first benchmark, our experiments show there exists a significant gap between the performance of models trained in simulation when they are tested in both simulations and their carefully constructed physical analogs.

Many tasks, such as use of hand tools, involve significant interaction forces between hand and environment. One control strategy would be to use high hand impedance to reduce sensitivity to these forces. But an alternative would be to learn feedback compensation for the extrinsic dynamics and associated interaction forces, with the potential for lower control effort. We observed subjects as they learned control of a ball-and-beam system, a visuo-motor task where the goal was to quickly position a ball rolling atop a rotating beam, through manual rotation of the beam alone. We devised a ball-and-beam apparatus that could be operated in a real mode, where a physical ball was present; or in a virtual training mode, where the ball's dynamics were simulated in real time. The apparatus presented the same visual feedback in all cases, and optionally produced haptic feedback of the interaction forces associated with the ball's motion. Two healthy adult subject groups, vision-only and vision-haptics (each n=10), both trained for 80 trials on the simulated system, and then were evaluated on the real system to test for skill transfer effects. If humans incorporate interaction forces in their learning, the vision-haptics group would be expected to exhibit a smoother transfer, as quantified by changes in completion time of a ball-positioning task. During training, both groups adapted well to the task, with reductions of 64%-70% in completion time.

One promising approach is the use of virtual environments for safe and versatile training. While it is known that humans can transfer non-visual spatial knowledge between real and virtual environments, limitations of these studies typically include results obtained mainly in simple environments, using mainly blindfolded-sighted participants and different methods of sensory input for real and virtual environments. In this study, participants with a wide range of visual experience use the EyeCane and Virtual EyeCane to solve complex Hebb-Williams mazes in real and virtual environments. The EyeCane and its virtual counterpart are minimalistic sensory substitution devices that code single-point distance information into sound. We test whether participants improve performance in the real-to-virtual sequence: solve a real maze and subsequently improve performance in the virtual maze. We also test whether participants can sole a virtual maze and subsequently improve performance in the virtual world: the virtual-to-real sequence. We find that participants can use sensory substitution guided navigation to extract spatial information from the virtual world and apply it to significantly improve their behavioral performance in the real world and vice versa. Our results demonstrate transfer in both direction, strengthening and extending the existing literature in terms of complexity, parameters, input-matching and varying levels of visual experience.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007542","Virtual Reality;assistive technology;Sensory Substitution;blind;Congenital Blindness;Low Vision;Acquired Blindness;Visual Rehabilitation;Environmental Rehabilitation;Spatial knowledge;Perceptual Learning;Maze Learning","Navigation;Virtual environments;Training;Visualization;Blindness;Meters","handicapped aids;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","nonvisual spatial knowledge transfer;real mazes;virtual mazes;sensory substitution;blind people;spatial learning;navigation;virtual environments;blindfolded-sighted participants;EyeCane;Virtual EyeCane;complex Hebb-Williams mazes;single-point distance information coding;input matching","","1","","36","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To eliminate the requirement of channel estimation and to improve the system performance, in this paper, we adopt a deep transfer learning (DTL) approach to implicitly extract the features of communication channel and directly recover tag symbols. Inspired by the powerful capability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in exploring the features of data in a matrix form, we design a novel covariance matrix aware neural network (CMNet)-based detection scheme to facilitate DTL for tag signal detection, which consists of offline learning, transfer learning, and online detection. Specifically, a CMNet-based likelihood ratio test (CMNet-LRT) is derived based on the minimum error probability (MEP) criterion. Taking advantage of the outstanding performance of DTL in transferring knowledge with only a few training data, the proposed scheme can adaptively fine-tune the detector for different channel environments to further improve the detection performance. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the BER performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the optimal detection method with perfect CSI.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9348274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348274","","Simulation;Bit error rate;Transfer learning;Detectors;Feature extraction;Covariance matrices;Signal detection","backscatter;channel estimation;covariance matrices;error statistics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;signal detection;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","ambient backscatter communications;tag signal detection algorithms;high bit error rate;channel state information;channel estimation;system performance;deep transfer learning approach;DTL;communication channel;tag symbols;powerful capability;convolutional neural networks;matrix form;novel covariance matrix aware neural network-based detection scheme;offline learning;online detection;CMNet-based likelihood ratio test;CMNet-LRT;minimum error probability criterion;different channel environments;detection performance;BER performance;optimal detection method","","","","17","","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our data-driven scheme exploits the fact that both DL and UL channels share the same propagation environment. As such, we extracted the environment information from UL channel response to a latent domain and then transferred the derived environment information from the latent domain to predict the DL channel. To prevent incorrect latent domain and the problem of oversimplistic assumptions, we did not use any specific parametric model and, instead, used data-driven approaches to discover the underlying structure of data without any prior model assumptions. To overcome the challenge of capturing the UL-DL joint distribution, we used a mean square error-based variant of the GAN structure with improved convergence properties called boundary equilibrium GAN. For training and testing we used simulated data of Extended Vehicular-A (EVA) and Extended Typical Urban (ETU) models.

Since the handwriting data is formatted as a set of ordered paths, it can teach any form of pen strokes, such as words, shapes, and even drawings. Training tasks are presented as a 3D game which captures children's attention and more effective visual motor integration (VMI) is anticipated than traditional paper materials. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the prototype.

In this paper, the joint downlink resource allocation problem for a SWIPT-enabled MC-NOMA system with time switching-based receivers is investigated, where pattern division multiple access (PDMA) technique is employed. We focus on minimizing the total transmit power of the system while satisfying the quality-of-service requirements of each user in terms of data rate and harvested power. The corresponding optimization problem is a non-convex and a mixed integer programming problem which is difficult to solve. Different from the conventional iterative searching-based algorithms, we propose an efficient deep learning-based approach to determine an approximated optimal solution. Specifically, we employ a typical class of deep learning model, namely, deep belief network (DBN), where the detailed procedure of the developed approach consists of three parts, i.e., data preparation, training, and running. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DBN-based approach can achieve similar performance of power consumption to the exhaustive search method.

Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) based sound rendering techniques, which seek to create a realistic virtual auditory space for listeners, have become a prominent concept in human robot interaction. Applications that demand high quality 3D sound synthesis are usually based on measured HRTFs of listeners. Recently, researchers propose to construct a set of personalized HRTFs using multiple linear regression models between anthropometric data and measured HRTFs, which implies the existence of a training HRTF dataset together with the corresponding anthropometric data. This paper focuses on the measurement of Head-Related transfer Functions (HRTFs) and the corresponding anthropometric data of a listener. Several state-of-the-art techniques of measuring the HRTFs are described. For measuring the anthropometric data, we develop a low budget approach, which enables us to measure the anthropometry of a person within short time at a high accuracy, whereas the hardware costs for the scanning system are significantly reduced.","","978-1-4244-9527-6","10.1109/SITIS.2010.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714537","","Three dimensional displays;Measurement by laser beam;Solid modeling;Anthropometry;Transfer functions;Lasers;Ear","acoustic signal processing;acoustic waves;anthropometry;ear;humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;regression analysis;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;transfer functions;virtual reality","anthropometric data measurement;HRTF personalization;multimodal human-like sensing;human centered robotic system;head related transfer function;sound rendering technique;virtual auditory space;human robot interaction;high quality 3D sound synthesis;multiple linear regression model;HRTF dataset;state-of-the-art technique;hardware cost","","3","9","15","","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensors nodes are facing the overwhelming challenge of energy consumption which gradually decreases the lifetime of overall network. The wireless power transfer (WPT) is one of the most emerging technologies of energy harvesting that deploys at the heart of sensor nodes for efficient lifetime solution. A wireless portable charging device (WPCD) is drifting inside the WSN to recharge all the nodes which are questing for the eternal life. In this paper, we aspire to optimize a multi-objective function for charging trail of WPCD, and self-learning algorithm for data routing jointly. We formulated that the objective functions can optimize the fair energy consumption as well as maximize the routing efficiency of WPCD. The fundamental challenge of the problem is, to integrate the novel path for WPCD by applying the Nodal A* algorithm. We proposed a novel method of sensor node's training for intellectual data transmission by using of clustering and reinforcement learning (SARSA) defined as clustering SARSA (C-SARSA) along with an optimal solution of objective functions. The whole mechanism outperforms in terms of trade-off between energy consumption and stability (fair energy consumption among all nodes) of the WSN; moreover, it prolongs the lifetime of the WSN. The simulated results demonstrate that our proposed method did better than compared literature in terms of energy consumption, stability, and lifetime of the WSN.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2918865","Key Supporting Project of Joint Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8721665","Clustering;energy conservation;energy harvesting;machine learning (SARSA);wireless power transfer;wireless sensor network;wireless portable charging device","Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Routing;Sensors;Batteries;Energy harvesting;Wireless communication","energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;radiofrequency power transmission;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","optimal wireless charging inclusive;intellectual routing;SARSA learning;renewable wireless sensor networks;sensor nodes;energy conservative;perpetual lifetime;sensors nodes;wireless power transfer;energy harvesting;efficient lifetime solution;wireless portable charging device;WPCD;WSN;multiobjective function;self-learning algorithm;data routing;objective functions;fair energy consumption;routing efficiency;sensor node;clustering;reinforcement learning","","5","","42","","24 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A desire to improve joint operability between the various military services coupled with the opportunity to capitalize on the advanced characteristics of current avionics components combined to enhance the viability of the Coast Guard's wish to upgrade the capabilities of its fleet. The Coast Guard finalized the plans and designs which incorporated digital avionics into a suite which formerly contained only analog components. The nonrecurring engineering necessary to perform this integration included the design of several new subsystems to allow for the interface between existing components and the new digital data bus.

Through training on a large-scale video dataset, most existing approaches aim to explore disentangled appearance and pose representations of training frames. Then, the desired output with a specific appearance and pose can be synthesized via recombining learned representations. However, in some real-world applications, test images may lack the corresponding video ground-truth or follow a different distribution than the distribution of the training video frames (i.e., different domains), which largely limit the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose domain-independent pose representations that are compatible with and accessible by still images from a different domain. Specifically, we devise a two-stage self-supervised pose adaptation framework for general image animation tasks. A domain-independent pose adaptation generative adversarial network (DIPA-GAN) and a shuffle-patch generative adversarial network (Shuffle-patch GAN) are proposed to penalize the rationality of the synthesized frame's pose and appearance, respectively. Finally, experiments evaluated on various image animation tasks, which include same/cross-domain moving objects, facial expression transfer and human pose retargeting, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over prior literature. Impact Statement-Image animation is a popular technology in video production. Benefiting from the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), recent image animation algorithms have been widely used in real-world applications, such as virtual AI news anchor, virtual try-on, and face swapping. However, most existing methods are designed for specific cases. To animate a new portrait, users are asked to collect hundreds of images of the same person and train a new model. The technology proposed in this paper overcomes these training limitations and generalizes image animations. In the challenging cross-domain facial expression transfer task, the user study demonstrated that our technology achieved more than 20% increase in animation success rate. The proposed technology could benefit users in a wide variety of industries including movie production, virtual reality, social media and online retail.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2020.3031581","Australian Research Council Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229197","Adversarial learning;deep learning;representation learning","Animation;Task analysis;Training;Generative adversarial networks;Artificial intelligence;Solid modeling;Adaptation models","computer animation;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pose estimation;video signal processing;virtual reality","cross-domain image animation;video sequence;large-scale video dataset;learned representations;adaptation framework;general image animation tasks;adaptation generative adversarial network;shuffle-patch generative adversarial network;synthesized frame;video production;animation success rate;cross-domain facial expression transfer task;image animation algorithm;video ground-truth","","","","59","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although both low dose computed tomography (LDCT) and computed tomography (CT) scans provide greater medical information than normal chest x-rays, access to these technologies in rural areas is very limited. There is a recent trend toward using computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to assist in the screening and diagnosis of cancer from biomedical images. In this study, the 121-layer convolutional neural network, also known as DenseNet-121 by G. Huang et. al., along with the transfer learning scheme is explored as a means of classifying lung cancer using chest x-ray images. The model was trained on a lung nodule dataset before training on the lung cancer dataset to alleviate the problem of using a small dataset. The proposed model yields 74.43±6.01% of mean accuracy, 74.96±9.85% of mean specificity, and 74.68±15.33% of mean sensitivity. The proposed model also provides a heatmap for identifying the location of the lung nodule.

The present study compares the ability of practicing veterinarians and veterinary students to identify the stiffness of virtual surfaces through palpation. An absolute identification paradigm was used where a force-feedback haptic device rendered virtual surfaces with five levels of stiffness within a “clinically relevant” range (0.2-0.5 N/mm). The mean information transfer was 0.97 bits (almost two perfectly identifiable stiffness levels) for 12 veterinarians and 0.58 bits (one correctly identified level) for 14 veterinary students. Although the difference between the two groups was significant (p <; 0.001), neither group was able to reliably identify more than two levels of stiffness, indicating that the success of veterinarians in clinical practice probably relies on additional properties such as size, shape, and texture. Analyses of force versus time and displacement versus time recordings suggest that the superior performance of the veterinarians may be partially attributable to motor strategy. Specifically, veterinarians used a greater mean maximum force (2.0 N) compared to students (1.6 N) (p <; 0.05). However, further studies are required to investigate motor strategy in more detail. The implications of our findings for veterinary education and quantitative skill assessment are discussed.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669308","Stiffness perception;stiffness identification;comparison of users;veterinary medicine;education;training.","Haptic interfaces;Force;Training;Measurement;Phantoms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Testing","biomedical education;computer based training;force feedback;haptic interfaces;rendering (computer graphics);statistical analysis;veterinary medicine;virtual reality","haptic stiffness identification;veterinarian;palpation;clinical skill;veterinary profession;medical health profession;veterinary student;identification paradigm;force-feedback haptic device;virtual surface rendering;mean information transfer;clinical practice;motor strategy;mean maximum force;veterinary education;quantitative skill assessment;veterinary medicine;training","","12","","34","","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper combines the benefits of the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment with a novel approach towards TF generation for DVR, where the traditional low-level color and opacity parameter manipulations are eliminated. The TF generation process is hidden behind a Spherical Self Organizing Map (SSOM). The user interacts with the visual form of the SSOM lattice on a mobile device while viewing the corresponding rendering of the volume dataset in real time in the CAVE. The SSOM lattice is obtained through high-dimensional features extracted from the volume dataset. The color and opacity values of the TF are automatically generated based on the user's perception. Hence, the resulting TF can expose complex structures in the dataset within seconds, which the user can analyze easily and efficiently through complete immersion.","2377-9322","978-1-4799-2614-5","10.1109/CIVEMSA.2014.6841433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841433","","Image color analysis;Rendering (computer graphics);Lattices;Data visualization;Vectors;Training;Three-dimensional displays","data visualisation;feature extraction;image colour analysis;medical computing;opacity;rendering (computer graphics);self-organising feature maps;transfer functions;vectors","ImmerVol;immersive volume visualization system;3D datasets analysis;medical domain;navigation;rendered dataset;transfer function;color values;opacity values;direct volume rendering;DVR;CAVE;automatic virtual environment;spherical self organizing map;SSOM;feature extraction","","","","19","","23 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, supervised learning was used to initially train the controller, then two system parameters were altered and the reinforcement learning algorithm proceeded to find an optimal solution. This required a total of 34 simulation cycles. The same task, using reinforcement learning alone, required almost 150 cycles.

There are various treatment ways, however, most of them are affected by various factors such as experience of physician and training intensity. The treatment effect cannot be fed back in time, and objective evaluation data is lacking. In addition, the treatment method is complicated, costly, and highly dependent on physicians. Moreover, stroke survivors' compliance is poor, which leads to various limitations. This paper combines the Internet-of-Things, machine learning, and intelligence system technologies to design a smartphone-based intelligence system to help stroke survivors to improve upper limb rehabilitation. With the built-in multi-modal sensors of the smart phone, training action data of users can be obtained, and then transfer to the server through the Internet.

Machine learning-based methods have recently emerged as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for MINLPs with affordable computational complexity. There have been some attempts in applying such methods to resource management in wireless networks, but these attempts require huge amounts of training samples and lack the capability to handle constrained problems. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance deterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and is referred to as the task mismatch problem. In this paper, to reduce the sample complexity and address the feasibility issue, we propose a framework of Learning to Optimize for Resource Management (LORM). In contrast to the end-to-end learning approach adopted in previous studies, LORM learns the optimal pruning policy in the branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs via a sample-efficient method, namely, imitation learning. To further address the task mismatch problem, we develop a transfer learning method via self-imitation in LORM, named LORM-TL, which can quickly adapt a pre-trained machine learning model to the new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that LORM outperforms specialized state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves near-optimal performance, while providing significant speedup compared with the branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, LORM-TL, by relying on a few unlabeled samples, achieves comparable performance with the model trained from scratch with sufficient labeled samples.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2947591","General Research Funding from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8879693","Resource allocation;mixed-integer nonlinear programming;wireless communications;few-shot learning;transfer learning","Resource management;Optimization;Machine learning algorithms;Wireless networks;Training;Machine learning;Heuristic algorithms","computational complexity;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);nonlinear programming;radio networks;telecommunication computing;tree searching","end-to-end learning approach;optimal pruning policy;branch-and-bound algorithm;MINLP;sample-efficient method;imitation learning;task mismatch problem;transfer learning method;named LORM-TL;pre-trained machine;additional unlabeled training samples;achieves near-optimal performance;unlabeled samples;sufficient labeled samples;wireless networks;effective resource management;mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems;machine learning-based methods;affordable computational complexity;constrained problems;severe performance deterioration;network parameters change;sample complexity","","14","","35","IEEE","22 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such authentic problems have enormous potential for learning as they are real and will probably arise in the controller's real work. Resolving authentic problems on a simulator encourages transfer by demonstrating when the knowledge is useful and by showing the effect of the learner's actions. However this process is difficult, since authentic problems tend to require a wide range of knowledge which often lead the learner in activities beyond their abilities. Some support is required for learning from simulation to occur. Sometimes this support is provided by human tutors (in ATC training for example this support is provided by a human instructor sitting at the back of the controller during the running of an exercise on the simulator), this support could also be given by a computer learning environment. This paper presents an intelligent simulator-based learning environment for air traffic controllers which provides a protected and guided environment to the learner. One central element of this environment is the ability to evaluate the learner's skills.

The signal classification uses spatially filtered signals and is based on spectral power estimation computed in individualized frequency bands, which are automatically identified by a specially tailored AR-based model. Relevant features are chosen by a criterion based on Mutual Information. Final recognition of motor imagery is effectuated by a multinomial logistic regression classifier. This BCI system was evaluated in two studies. In the first study, five participants trained the ability to imagine of the right hand, left hand and feet in response to visual cues.

In this system, it is extremely challenging to develop a low-complexity detector due to the nonlinearity of an end-to-end channel transfer function (created by relays' operations and one-bit ADCs). Furthermore, there is no efficient way to estimate such complex function with a limited number of training data. Motivated by this, we propose a supervised-learning (SL) detector by introducing a novel Bernoulli-like model in which training data is directly used to design a detector rather than estimating a channel transfer function. It is shown that the proposed SL detector outperforms the existing SL detectors based on Gaussian model for one-bit quantized (binary observation) systems.

The student makes all the settings wanted on the client computer and then sends them to a lab server. The server makes measurements requested and returns the data obtained. The whole procedure takes only a second or two. A number of clients can access the experiments simultaneously. The laboratory is used in ordinary courses for on-campus students.

While ATM provides increased flexibility in supporting various types of traffic the traffic control problems become more difficult to solve when trying to achieve efficient use of network resources. One of such problem is the bandwidth allocation. This paper presents a new approach to the bandwidth allocation problem for video traffic using radial basis functions neural networks (RBFNN). Estimation of an accurate amount of bandwidth to support this traffic has been a challenging task using conventional algorithmic approaches. In this paper, we show that a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is capable of learning the non-linear multi-dimentional mapping between different multimedia traffic patterns quality of service (QoS) requirements and the required bandwidth to support each call. Our method employs ""on-line"" measurements of the traffic count process over a monitoring period which is determined such that the error in estimating the bandwidth is minimized to less than 3% of the actual value. In order to simplify the design of the RBFNN, the input traffic is preprocessed through a low pass filter in order to smooth all high frequency fluctuations. A large set of training data, representing different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, was used to ensure that RBFNN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new data. The reported results prove that the neurocomputing approach is effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods, based upon mathematical or simulation.","","0-7803-5284-X","10.1109/ICC.1999.767912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=767912","","Channel allocation;Bit rate;Communication system traffic control;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Traffic control;Radial basis function networks;Monitoring;Data preprocessing","bandwidth allocation;multimedia communication;visual communication;telecommunication control;radial basis function networks;telecommunication computing;asynchronous transfer mode;telecommunication traffic;quality of service","bandwidth allocation;variable bit rate video;ATM networks;radial basis function neural networks;multimedia traffic;traffic control;video traffic;RBFNN;nonlinear multi-dimentional mapping;multimedia traffic patterns;quality of service;monitoring;input traffic;low pass filter;high frequency fluctuations;neurocomputing approach","","","4","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome high path-loss in the mmWave frequency band, beamforming technology is necessary. Especially, there has been widespread interest in development of hybrid beamforming (HB) technologies, in view of reducing cost and power consumption in massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. Some of existing researches on HB algorithms assumed perfect channel state information (CSI) and the others used beam training process in case of assuming imperfect CSI. When beam training process is used, enough beam training has to be conducted to achieve sufficient system performance in massive MIMO systems, which results in significant training overhead. Thus, it is necessary to reduce beam training complexity. Compared to state-of-the-art technology, we propose a multi-user HB system using codebooks based on a deep neural network (DNN) in this paper. In our proposed scheme, beam codewords for the base station (BS) and all users can be inferred using limited beam training in cases when the channel state information (CSI) is unknown. In order to apply the proposed scheme to situations where the CSI is unknown, reference radio frequency (RF) beamformers were introduced. Also, the proposed DNN structure is designed considering introduced reference RF beamformers. By using the proposed DNN with reference RF beamformers, the proposed system can inferred optimal beam codewords with limited beam training. Results obtained from simulations indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as a conventional scheme with less beam training complexity. We also show that the performances achieved by the proposed scheme are gradually increased as training epoch is increased, eventually converging to a steady-state value.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990317","BK21 PLUS and Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) Grant; Korean Government (MSIT), Development of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer System Using Same Resource Based on Multiple Antennas; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078064","Hybrid beamforming;deep neural network;limited feedback beamforming;mmWave communication","Training;Array signal processing;Radio frequency;Antenna arrays;Millimeter wave communication;Discrete Fourier transforms;Antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing;communication complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);millimetre wave communication;network coding;neural nets;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","deep neural network;base station;optimal beam codewords;beam training complexity;millimeter-wave communication;wireless communications;mmWave frequency band;hybrid beamforming technologies;massive multiple input multiple output systems;perfect channel state information;beam training process;imperfect CSI;massive MIMO systems;radiofrequency beamformers;DNN;BS;HB technologies;RF beamformers","","","","25","CCBY","24 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But the efficient interaction with the large size of medical data is a challenging task to diagnose virtual surgerical environment learning for a Physician. In this paper, we proposed a multimodal interface for GPU-accelerated interactive large scale volumetric data rendering to overcome this limitation. The large data has been pre-processed by octree method. An improved raycasting algorithm is used in association with a transfer function classification method for the effective rendering. The temporal data is used for defining gestures, retrieving in a pattern from the wearable device for providing multimodality with the large rendered data. A gesture vocabulary has been defined by these patterns for the navigation in visualizing the large scale medical data, which consists of five complex interactive postures used for Normal, Picking, Rotation, Dragging, and Zooming gestures. These gesture vocabularies have been categorized by kNN classification method of pattern recognition. Experimental results of the proposed approach are analyzed with the help of various ANOVA and T-testing graphs using SPSS 20 version tool and confidence interval of interaction with hand gestures vocabulary. The results of proposed approach are further compared with the existing approaches in which Microsoft Kinect and P5 dataglove have been used.

Moreover, it is difficult and stressful for the disabled to drive agricultural machinery. Besides, current artificial intelligence technology could not fully realize tractor autonomous driving because of a high uncertain filed environment and short interruptions of satellite navigation signal shaded by trees. To reduce manual operations, a tractor assistant driving control method was proposed based on the human-machine interface utilizing the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. First, the EEG signals of the tractor drivers were collected by a low-cost brain-computer interface (BCI), followed by denoising using a wavelet packet. Then the spectral features of EEG signals were calculated and extracted as the input of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Finally, the EEG-aided RNN driving model was trained for tractor driving robot control such as straight going, brake, left turn, and right turn operations, which control accuracy was 94.5% and time cost was 0.61 ms. Also, 8 electrodes were selected by the PCA algorithm for the design of a portable EEG controller. And the control accuracy reached 93.1% with the time cost of 0.48 ms. To solve the incomplete driving data set in the actual world because some driving manners may cause dangerous or even death, RNN-TL algorithm was employed by creating the complete driving data in the virtual environment followed by transferring the driving control experience to the actual world with small actual driving data set in the field, which control accuracy was 93.5% and time consumption was 0.48 ms. The experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed tractor driving control method based on EEG signal combined with RNN-TL deep learning algorithm which can work with the displacement error less than 6.7 mm when the tractor speed is less than 50 km/h.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021051","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Three New Agricultural Project in Jiangsu Province; Asia Hub NAU-MSU Joint Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9186275","Electroencephalographic (EEG);brain-computer interface (BCI);recurrent neural network (RNN);assistant driving;driving robot","Agricultural machinery;Electroencephalography;Wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Brain-computer interfaces;Manipulators","agricultural machinery;brain-computer interfaces;control engineering computing;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;principal component analysis;recurrent neural nets;signal processing;virtual reality","EEG-aided RNN driving model;recurrent neural network;virtual environment;tractor speed;tractor driving control method;driving control experience;RNN-TL algorithm;driving manners;driving data;portable EEG controller;PCA algorithm;robot control;RNN driving model;low-cost brain-computer interface;tractor drivers;EEG signal;electroencephalographic signal;human-machine interface;satellite navigation signal;tractor autonomous driving;artificial intelligence technology;agricultural machinery;high-intensity work;RNN-TL deep learning algorithm;tractor assistant driving control method","","","","41","CCBY","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we formulate the downlink channel prediction as a deep transfer learning (DTL) problem, and propose the direct-transfer algorithm based on the fully-connected neural network architecture, where the network is trained in the manner of classical deep learning and is then fine-tuned for new environments. To further improve the transfer efficiency, we propose the meta-learning algorithm that trains the network by alternating inner-task and across-task updates and then adapts to a new environment with a small number of labeled data. Simulation results show that the direct-transfer algorithm achieves better performance than the deep learning algorithm, which implies that the transfer learning benefits the downlink channel prediction in new environments. Moreover, the meta-learning algorithm significantly outperforms the direct-transfer algorithm, which validates its effectiveness and superiority.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2020.3019077","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175003","Deep transfer learning (DTL);meta-learning;few-shot learning;downlink CSI prediction;FDD;massive MIMO","Downlink;Prediction algorithms;Uplink;Machine learning;MIMO communication;Task analysis;Training","channel estimation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);frequency division multiplexing;MIMO communication;neural net architecture;telecommunication computing","deep learning algorithm;downlink channel prediction;metalearning algorithm;direct-transfer algorithm;FDD massive MIMO systems;frequency division duplexing massive multiple-input multiple-output systems;deep transfer learning problem;fully-connected neural network architecture;transfer efficiency improvement;artificial intelligence;downlink channel state information prediction;CSI prediction;DTL;alternating inner-task;across-task updates;labeled data","","4","","50","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the system, an instructor only has to upload the slide with narration created on PowerPoint to the system, and then he/she can publish a Windows Media streaming video and a PDF slide. The application of the system is the website of streaming video lectures contributed by researchers in the field of pulsed power, which we call “Streaming Book on Pulsed Power Engineering”. Another application of it is the website of video lectures for graduate students as a part of blended learning. To deliver streaming videos to more than 100 students simultaneously, we need to configure quality of encoding streaming videos and estimate the amount of transferring data and the network traffic load. The purpose of this study is to examine the traffic load for streaming e-Learning content in applications of KUMA system.

Essay and string responses in the IMathAS homework system have to be manually graded, making the free response questions difficult to generate instant feedback. The ability to write questions with automatic feedback during active lecture offer improvements to the current systems and provide an opportunity for critical thinking to occur. The following study provides framework for an interpretive neural network to be implemented into any IMathAS system. These responses can be in the form of equations, words and sentences, or pictures. Findings show that correctly trained networks using manually graded artifacts can be more than 90% accurate in providing feedback to a correct answer in student practice, allowing for lessons that guide students towards correct and well-phrased answers using their own words, and can even assign partial credit. The findings imply that Marzano's taxonomy level of analysis can be reached using the IMathAS system and that critical thinking methods can be directly applied for scoring. When integrated into the existing system, simulation-based or mixed reality homework can have free responses and the grades can be transferred via learning tool interoperability connection into the institutional learning management system for direct scoring in the gradebook.","","978-1-7281-4899-1","10.1109/ISMCR47492.2019.8955695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955695","neural networks;mixed reality education application;critical thinking;undergraduate education","Neural networks;Mathematical model;Training;Tungsten;Software","computer aided instruction;interactive systems;Internet;open systems","IMathAS homework system;interpretive neural network;IMathAS system;critical thinking methods;mixed reality homework;institutional learning management system;free response evaluation;simulation learning;interactive class;learning tool interoperability connection","","","","16","","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It in turn determines the optimal SD per frame, satisfying ABR throughput and SCR blocking probability requirements while retaining maximal aggregate throughput. Simulation results postulate the optimal SDs under various ABR and SCR traffic conditions.

The cooperative optimization of this high dimensional space is a difficult problem which obviously has a highly correlated characterization where human network operators cannot possibly capture these correlations. Model-free Reinforcement Learning techniques represent a potential solution to our problem. Specifically, we use Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) to improve networking performance. We have developed a high-fidelity network simulation tool we call Tactical Airborne Network Simulator (TANS) which we use to train our neural network before deploying to the field where the asset is deployed to some mission which is hopefully somewhat similar to the scenarios used for training. By utilizing the model developed under the TANS training scenarios for the target mission scenario our learning technique gets a head start, rather than using a truly model-free approach. Our technique is codified in the ML community as “Deep Transfer Learning” [4] where terms and metrics have been examined. This paper represents an initial investigation into both the decision support agent architecture and the ML technique. Upcoming research will be described below including our vision for an expanded agent architecture as well as ideas for improved ML techniques which ultimately will result in better wireless network performance. Here we demonstrate a minor throughput performance improvement of 4% using a proof of concept agent over the use of a standard unassisted network. We improved the throughput from 309kbps to 324 kbps.","2155-7586","978-1-7281-4280-7","10.1109/MILCOM47813.2019.9020975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9020975","Airborne Networking;Machine Learning;Deep Q-Learning Networks","Antennas;Atmospheric modeling;Training;Orbits;Routing protocols;Learning (artificial intelligence);Bandwidth","aerospace simulation;aircraft communication;data visualisation;decision support systems;learning (artificial intelligence);military communication;multi-agent systems;neural nets;optimisation;radio networks;software agents;telecommunication computing","cognitive ML agent;deep reinforcement learning architecture;heterogeneous airborne wireless network;high dimensional space;highly correlated characterization;human network operators;model-free reinforcement learning techniques;high-fidelity network simulation tool;neural network;TANS training scenarios;model-free approach;decision support agent architecture;expanded agent architecture;improved ML techniques;throughput performance improvement;standard unassisted network;deep transfer learning;tactical airborne network simulator;deep Q-learning networks;wireless network performance improvement;cooperative optimization","","","","16","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vehicle models and road conditions in real world can be very different from those in simulators. As a result, the RL models trained by simulators usually fail and need to be trained again under a new environment, which is dangerous and time-consuming. Some hand-craft heuristic methods, by contrast, are independent of environmental characters and perform more reliably in an unfamiliar situation. In this paper, we introduce a heuristically initialized RL model (HeuRL), which sped up the learning convergence by 4 times and decreased the collisions by 90% during the training process under a new environment. The experiments were conducted in The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS), an open-source platform for real-time car racing simulation.","","978-1-5386-8243-2","10.1109/ICCR.2018.8534494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8534494","robotic control;autonomous driving;artificial intelligence;reinforcement learning;simulator","Automobiles;Sensors;Wheels;Autonomous vehicles;Brakes;Target tracking","automobiles;digital simulation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;public domain software;road traffic control","heuristically initialized reinforcement learning method;autonomous driving control task;real-world vehicle control tasks;Sim2Real;vehicle models;road conditions;heuristically initialized RL model;HeuRL;learning convergence;real-time car racing simulation;open racing car simulator;simulation-to-real-world;open-source platform","","","","11","","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the recent years, deep learning (DL) has been introduced into AMC due to its outstanding identification performance. However, it is almost impossible to implement previously proposed DL-based AMC algorithms without large number of labeled samples, while there are generally few labeled sample and large unlabel samples in the realistic communication scenarios. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning (TL)-based semi-supervised AMC (TL-AMC) in a zero-forcing aided multiple-input and multiple-output (ZF-MIMO) system. TL-AMC has a novel deep reconstruction and classification network (DRCN) structure that consists of convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlabeled samples flow from CAE for modulation signal reconstruction, while labeled samples are fed into CNN for AMC. Knowledge is transferred from the encoder layer of CAE to the feature layer of CNN by sharing their weights, in order to avoid the ineffective feature extraction of CNN under the limited labeled samples. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of TL-AMC. In detail, TL-AMC performs better than CNN-based AMC under the limited samples. What's more, when compared with CNN-based AMC trained on massive labeled samples, TL-AMC also achieved the similar classification accuracy at the relative high SNR regime.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2020.2992128","Project Funded by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor; Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Jiangsu High-level Talent; Six Top Talents Program of Jiangsu; 1311 Talent Plan of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9085414","Automatic modulation classification;deep learning;convolutional neural network;transfer learning;multiple-input and multiple-output","Modulation;MIMO communication;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Equalizers","convolutional neural nets;cooperative communication;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;modulation;pattern classification;signal reconstruction;telecommunication computing","deep learning;AMC algorithms;generally few labeled sample;large unlabel samples;realistic communication scenarios;transfer learning-based semisupervised AMC;TL-AMC;deep reconstruction;unlabeled samples;modulation signal reconstruction;CNN-based AMC;massive labeled samples;semisupervised automatic modulation classification;ZF-MIMO systems;noncooperative communication systems;communications scenarios","","10","","46","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

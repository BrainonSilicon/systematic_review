The main implementation issue is to mimic the real behavior of the body at the extremely high rates required by haptic devices. Since even high-end computers have inadequate performance, one possible solution is to exploit the parallelism of modern Graphics Processing Units. In this paper we present our research aiming at moving the whole computational process from the CPU to the GPU taking advantage of the computational power of the graphics hardware. We use a mass-spring model, augmented with local damping coefficients and volume preservation forces. Collision detection is performed against external rigid bodies with high complexity mesh, such as the skeletonpsilas one. The user interacts with the model by controlling virtual tools, i.e. probes or tweezers. Haptic forces are computed on GPU and the results are asyncronously transferred to the CPU. Our approach can simulate the deformation of complex models with gravity and interaction with environment and tools at a frame rate higher than 1 KHz, making it suitable for visual rendering and haptic feedback.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-2057-5","10.1109/IROS.2008.4650837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650837","","Computational modeling;Springs;Surgery;Force;Deformable models;Haptic interfaces;Arrays","computer graphics;haptic interfaces;interactive systems","deformable environment simulation;haptic feedback;deformable bodies;computer aided surgery;haptic devices;graphics processing units;volume preservation forces;collision detection;haptic forces","","10","1","16","","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These communications enable the accurate vehicle rollover prediction in Human-Vehicle-Road interaction. However, considering the strong non-linear characteristics of Human-Vehicle-Road interaction and the uncertainty of modeling, the traditional deterministic method cannot meet the requirement of accurate prediction of rollover hazard for heavy vehicles. In order to improve the accuracy of vehicles rollover prediction, this paper proposes a developed rollover prediction algorithm based on the multiple observed variables by combining the failure probability in reliability and the empirical model. This approach applies the probability method of uncertainty to the design of dynamic rollover prediction algorithm for heavy vehicles and establishes a classification model of heavy vehicles based on support vector machine (SVM) with multiple observed variables. The failure probability of rollover limit state of heavy vehicles is calculated by Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS), Radial-Based Importance Sampling (RBIS), and Truncated Importance Sampling (TIS), respectively. Then the Fishhook, Double Lane Change tests, and J-turn tests, simulated in TruckSim, are carried out to validate the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the rollover prediction algorithm based on failure probability can effectively improve the rollover prediction accuracy for heavy vehicles. Moreover, based on the communication in CVIS, the failure probability can be obtained before entering the specific road. Meanwhile, this approach can reduce the external interference of strong non-linear characteristics of Human-Vehicle-Road interaction and the uncertainty of the modeling to the system, thus improving the prediction accuracy of active safety performance of heavy vehicles significantly.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994026","Teaching Quality and Reform of Higher Vocational Education Project of Guangdong Province; Hebei provincial High Level Talents Foundation of Hebei Province; Hebei Province Key Research and Development Project; Natural Science Foundation of Characteristic Innovation Project of Guangdong Ordinary University and the Science and Technology Research Project of Hebei Higher Education; Subsidized Projects For Overseas Students; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091526","Failure probability;heavy vehicles;load transfer ratio;rollover risk prediction;SVM classification model","Reliability;Monte Carlo methods;Roads;Predictive models;Indexes;Uncertainty;Prediction algorithms","automotive engineering;importance sampling;Monte Carlo methods;probability;reliability;road accidents;road safety;road vehicles;support vector machines;user interfaces;vehicle dynamics","SVM;support vector machine;double lane change tests;Fishhook;J-turn tests;TruckSim;TIS;truncated importance sampling;RBIS;radial-based importance sampling;MCS;Monte Carlo sampling;human-vehicle-road interaction;dynamic rollover prediction algorithm;failure probability;vehicle rollover prediction;vehicle-infrastructure system;heavy vehicles","","","","31","CCBY","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The HMI system consists of touchscreen, gesture, and haptic interfaces enabling bilateral driver-vehicle interaction. TLI along with the HMI capable of multimodal feedback can provide situation-adaptive spatial information which enhance the driver situational awareness in a short time. To evaluate the proposed system we conducted driving experiments involving unscheduled takeover situations in urban environment using a driving simulator. We analyzed driver reaction times, physiological responses including heart rate, skin conductance and subjective workload as well as qualitative feedback comparing with manual takeover. The results show that TLI can reduce driver workload, reaction times, and improve driver behavior.

We attempt to address these challenges by proposing a dialogue management architecture that has an abstracted view of the world but yet is able to focus on relevant parts of the ontology at runtime. Specifically, we train a sub-domain identifier neural network that learns which features are relevant to the current turn and the immediate future, thus filtering out irrelevant information from the ontology and consequently the belief space at each dialogue turn. We then train a policy network that needs: a) to adapt to the sub-domain identifier's output; and b) to learn what information will carry over from previous turns and when it needs to be updated. We evaluate our method on a large information-seeking ontology that contains latent sub-domains. Our results in simulation and a small human trial show that the sub-domain identifier is able to generalise to unseen domains and achieve performance on par with a multi-domain dialogue manager where each sub-domain is carefully defined (golden standard).","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461754","Spoken Dialogue Management;Multiple Domains;Dialogue Policy;Policy Network","Ontologies;Electronics packaging;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Face;Neural networks","human computer interaction;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;neural nets;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","trained policy models;sub-domain identifier neural network;abstracted view;dialogue management architecture;multidomain dialogue systems;scalable information-seeking multidomain dialogue;multidomain dialogue manager;unseen domains;latent sub-domains;information-seeking ontology;policy network;dialogue turn;irrelevant information","","","","17","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Concretely, we develop an iOS application in which the user is presented with a team of robots and a bounding box (prism). The user carefully translates and scales the prism in a virtual environment; these prism coordinates are wirelessly transferred to our server and then received as input to distributed onboard robot controllers. We develop a novel distributed multirobot control policy which provides guarantees on convergence to a goal with distance bounded linearly in the number of robots, and avoids interrobot collisions.

Agents that interact with a dynamic physical environment have requirements not shared by virtual agents, including the need to transfer information about the world and their interaction with it. The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data. Instead, real world systems typically employ application specific protocols to transfer video, audio, sensory, or telemetry data. These protocols lack the transparency and portability of formal agent communication languages and consequently are limited in their scalability. We propose augmenting the capabilities of current multi-agent systems to provide for the efficient transfer of low-level information, by allowing backchannels of communication between agents with flexible protocols in a carefully principled way. We show that this extension can yield significant performance increases in communication efficiency and discuss the benefits of incorporating backchannels into a search a rescue robot system.","1050-4729","0-7803-8232-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307377","","Multiagent systems;Robot kinematics;Telemetry;Streaming media;Software agents;Robot sensing systems;Frequency;Software systems;Decision making;Financial management","multi-agent systems;virtual reality;multi-robot systems;telecommunication channels;machine oriented languages","multiagent systems;virtual agents;agent communication languages;rescue robot system;backchannel communication","","24","","16","","6 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In computer-based environments, where learners interact only with a computer and do not have access to direct support from a teacher, learners need to be provided with instructional prompts or just-in-time help intended to encourage more active example processing during learning. This study investigated whether it was more beneficial to provide the learners access to on-demand (self-regulated) help after they committed an error in problem solving or for the learning environment to regulate the presentation of instructional help externally. Furthermore, two different presentational formats-textual and pictorial-of instructional prompts were examined. This study was conducted with a computer-based learning environment that introduced high school students without any prior content-specific knowledge to the principles of parallel and series circuit analysis. Textual prompts facilitated practice problem solving notably better than pictorial prompts. Overall, textual-based prompts produced a large effect on near transfer. A significant format of prompts by academic ability interaction was discovered on near transfer. In particular, lower-ability learners scored significantly better when given textual prompts; whereas, their higher-ability counterparts performed equally well with both formats. Moreover, learners provided with externally regulated prompts reported significantly more positive attitudes toward the prompts in general compared to learners in the self-regulated conditions. Finally, continuous motivation was significantly stronger in learners who viewed textual prompts than in their counterparts in the pictorial prompt groups.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2005.852602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495662","Backward fading;computer-based learning environment;electrical circuit analysis;external control;high school;instructional prompts;learner control;pictorial format;textual format","Electronics engineering education;Circuit simulation;Computer aided instruction","electronic engineering education;circuit analysis computing;computer aided instruction","instructional prompts;electrical circuit analysis;computer-based learning environment;high school students;parallel circuit analysis;series circuit analysis;textual prompts;pictorial prompts","","15","","21","","15 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, control and optimization schemes sometimes require data to be transferred to be able to operate. Despite these synergies, these tasks are generally treated separately. In this work, we aim to reduce the gap between those activities to facilitate the development of interactive and collaborative systems.

New educational technologies have been driven by the improvement in computer network capabilities that address client-server dynamics, access mechanisms and network services. Furthermore, multimedia authoring tools, the World Wide Web and the Java programming paradigm are leading to the creation of new and effective didactic environments. In this scenario, particular attention must be paid to the learning design process, since students can learn better when they are stimulated by a high level of interactivity and they can follow a personal way to learn. In this paper, a new approach to Web-based courseware development is presented: the Real Experiment eXecution (REX) approach. The proposed approach is well-suited to the development of courseware in the field of computer science. Following the REX approach, it is possible to integrate into the courseware a high degree of interaction since, instead of simulation activity, real experiments are carried out through the execution of operations. The Java programming paradigm allows the execution, control and monitoring of these operations.

Proceedings of the","26 Feb 2004","2004","","","9 pp.","","The value of collaboration as a tool to promote learning is becoming increasingly more evident. Students engaged in collaborative efforts typically retain the information being learned longer by becoming more actively engaged in the learning activity. There is evidence that collaborative activities foster higher-order thinking skills such as analytical reasoning, synthesis, and evaluation. Furthermore, students work in an environment that better prepares them to meet the challenges inherent in succeeding in the workforce. Constructivism in the form of project-based learning has likewise been shown to foster increased retention of material and greater depth of learning. When combined with collaborative assignments, students have demonstrated greater retention and enhanced capability of transferring concepts to practice. Promoting collaboration in a classroom setting is difficult and often resisted by both teachers and students. This difficulty is magnified for courses offered in an online learning environment. Although there are a number of applications available to enable real-time communication, the immediacy and intimacy of person-to-person interaction is difficult to replace. The non-verbal cues that comprise a large part of everyday communication are largely lost through even the richest online environment. As a result, educators are faced with a dilemma: both students and academic institutions are flocking towards courses offered via an asynchronous learning network, but there is no clear understanding of how to foster collaboration, one of the most promising pedagogical tools. Although asynchronous online environments certainly lack the intimacy and immediacy inherent in face-to-face settings and simulated to an extent by synchronous applications, meaningful collaborative assignments are still possible. The proposed paper details a five-step systems approach for fostering project-based, collaborative learning in an asynchronous learning environment. The steps are illustrated with examples from a graduate-level course in multimedia systems in which asynchronous collaboration was a featured assignment.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265065","","Collaborative work;Collaborative tools;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Multimedia systems;Educational institutions;Information analysis;International collaboration","distance learning;groupware;educational courses","asynchronous collaborative learning;collaborative activities;higher-order thinking skills;project-based learning;collaborative assignments;online learning;real-time communication;nonverbal cues;academic institutions;asynchronous learning network;asynchronous online environments;graduate-level course;multimedia systems","","18","","25","","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although some children outgrow asthma while transitioning into adulthood, there are others who continue to suffer from life-threatening asthmatic exacerbations. Teenagers tend to have certain misconceptions about their asthmatic condition and treatment which are rarely recognized or addressed in regular clinical consultations. After reviewing the literature in this field, we have identified that improving patient knowledge can be effective in augmenting engagement, and considerably improving their clinical outcomes. It is necessary to develop an effective educational intervention that can help Asthma patients change their perception about self-efficacy and ultimately reduce the total health care costs incurred. Hence, a sound transfer of knowledge during the transition from childcare to adult care is highly recommended. On these very lines, Georgia Institute of Technology designed an interactive educational application called Asthma Academy in conjunction with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. This website resides in the public cloud and uses a novel animation video-based curriculum to deliver essential healthcare education to asthmatic adolescents in an interactive manner. What distinguishes it from similar initiatives is the use of a cost-effective technique to simulate caregiver-patient interactions and the ability to cater to a wide range of socio-economic statuses and educational levels. A group-based study with twenty asthma adolescents was conducted to evaluate the user acceptance and performance of Asthma Academy supplemented by regular check-ups over a period of eight to ten weeks.

However, because of non-uniform data access speed and memory capacity bottlenecks, the interactive rendering ability for large-scale time-varying data is still a major challenge. Data compression can alleviate these two bottlenecks. But just simply applying the data compression strategy to the visualization pipeline, the interaction problem can not be effectively solved because a lot of redundant data still existed in volume data. In this paper, a smart compression scheme based on the information theory is present to accelerate large-scale time-varying volume rendering. A formula of entropy was proposed, which can be used to automatically calculate the data importance to help scientists analyze and extract feature from the massive data. Then lossy data compression and data transfer is directly operated on these feature data, the remaining non-critical data was discarded in the process, and GPU ray-casting volume render is used for fast rendering. The experiment results shown that our smart compression scheme can reduce the amount of data as much as possible while maintaining the characteristics of the data, and therefore greatly improved the time-varying volume rendering speed even when dealing with the large scale time-varying data.","","978-1-4577-2156-4","10.1109/ICVRV.2011.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092714","volume rendering;visualization;time-varying data;information visualization","Rendering (computer graphics);Graphics processing unit;Data visualization;Entropy;Data compression;Pipelines;Quantization","computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;data compression;data visualisation;interactive systems;rendering (computer graphics)","smart compression scheme;GPU-accelerated volume rendering;large-scale time-varying data;interactive rendering ability;lossy data compression","","3","","13","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The procedure combines learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning: a robot first imitates a demonstrator's execution of the task and then learns contextualized variants of the demonstrated action through experience. We use dynamic movement primitives as compact motion representations, and a model-based C-REPS algorithm for learning policies that can specify hand-over position, conditioned on context variables. Policies are learned using simulated task executions, before transferring them to the robot and evaluating emergent behaviours. We additionally conduct a user study involving participants assuming different postures and receiving an object from a robot, which executes hand-overs by either imitating a demonstrated motion, or adapting its motion to hand-over positions suggested by the learned policy. The results confirm the hypothesized improvements in the robot's perceived behaviour when it is context-aware and adaptive, and provide useful insights that can inform future developments.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197476","","Robots;Task analysis;Trajectory;Context modeling;Encoding;Adaptation models;Learning (artificial intelligence)","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);service robots;ubiquitous computing","demonstrated motion;learned policy;perceived behaviour;context-aware task execution;apprenticeship learning;assistive service robots;human-oriented tasks;task parameters;optimal behaviour;robot-to-human object hand-over;reinforcement learning;demonstrator;contextualized variants;demonstrated action;dynamic movement primitives;compact motion representations;model-based C-REPS algorithm;hand-over position;context variables;simulated task executions;evaluating emergent behaviours;context-aware action generalization","","","","35","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We reviewed empirical research in which participants had to drive a vehicle in a real or simulated environment, were able to control the heading and/or speed of the vehicle, and a haptic signal was provided to them. The results indicated that a clear distinction can be made between warning systems (using vibrations) and guidance systems (using continuous forces). Studies typically used reaction time measures for evaluating warning systems and vehicle-centred performance measures for evaluating guidance systems. In general, haptic warning systems reduced the reaction time of a driver compared to no warnings, although these systems may cause annoyance. Guidance systems generally improved the performance of drivers compared to non-aided driving, but these systems may suffer from after-effects.

Previous generative conversational models usually employ a single and deterministic encoder-decoder framework to model the semantic consistency between the context and corresponding response. However, they neglect the various dialog patterns (we denote the regularity of topic shifting as dialog pattern) in the conversations, leading to uninformative, non-initiative yet plausible responses. Although the existing variational methods have improved the response diversity to some extent by introducing a global variability into the generative process, they fail to simulate the transfer between topics with directional information due to the weak interpretability of the Gaussian-distributed latent variables. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Variational Scaling Reasoning Network (NVSRN) for initiative response generation. To this end, our approach has two core ingredients: neural dialog pattern reasoner (reasoner) and topic scaling mechanism. Specifically, inspired by the advantage of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution modeling the directional data (e.g., the topic transfer state), we employ it as the latent space of the reasoner to explore the regularity of topic shifting, which is then used to reason the topic of response. Based on this, a topic scaling mechanism is designed to control the transfer degree of topic in the response generator. The experimental results on two large dialog datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The human evaluation shows the proposed model can produce more informative and initiative responses actively.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-4604-1","10.1109/ICDM.2019.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970864","dialogue generation, topic shifting, von Mises Fisher distribution, conditional variational autoencoder, topic scaling mechanism","","decoding;encoding;inference mechanisms;interactive systems;natural language interfaces;neural nets;pattern clustering;variational techniques","NVSRN;initiative response generation;open-domain multiturn dialogue systems;human-machine interactions;single encoder-decoder framework;deterministic encoder-decoder framework;corresponding response;plausible responses;variational methods;response diversity;generative process;Gaussian-distributed latent variables;neural dialog pattern reasoner;topic scaling mechanism;von Mises-Fisher distribution;topic transfer state;response generator;dialog datasets;initiative responses;neural variational scaling reasoning network;generative conversational models","","","","44","","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The studies on the topic tackle various problems, such as the hand dexterity, the communication cues, the arms motions, the forces, the head motions, but most of them consider a handover as an independent action, decorrelated from the plan it is part of. In this paper, we consider situations where it might be necessary (or preferable) to achieve several handovers in order to transfer an object from one agent to another one. This problem complexity grows accordingly with the number of agents that might be involved in the task, making a classical approach under efficient. We propose a graph-based approach enabling a fast computation of a solution taking into account different parameters linked to the humans comfort and preferences. An abstract model of the task is also used as a heuristic to guide the search in the graph, a search which is performed with a Lazy Weighted A*. The method computes which agents (human or robot) to use and where handovers should be performed. It also computes motion plans for each robot, ensures that humans can reach handover places and preserves comfort of human partners by reducing, for instance, their efforts. The method has been implemented and is demonstrated on various simulated multi-agents environments and on our two PR2 robots interacting with two humans.","","978-1-4799-9994-1","10.1109/IROS.2015.7354302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354302","","Handover;Robots;Navigation;Planning;Computational modeling;Search problems","graph theory;human-robot interaction;motion control;multi-robot systems;path planning","handovers planning;constrained environment;hand dexterity;communication cues;arms motions;forces;head motions;object transfer;graph-based approach;humans comfort;humans preferences;lazy weighted A*;motion plans;multiagents environments;PR2 robots;human interaction;human-robot collaboration","","9","","24","","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The program also provides comprehensive ""hands-on"" laboratory experience in configuring, maintaining, troubleshooting and simulating networks. The university intends to increase its student base through online education retaining the same quality of interactions as the onsite program. In the online context, the design and the implementation of an effective remote interactive laboratory (RIL) environment is highly challenging on account of the special hardware, simulation and computing needs of the internetworking courses. This paper focuses on translating the onsite laboratory elements into the online RIL environment by allowing students at geographically remote sites to access and interact with internetworking devices located at Halifax. The RIL is devised using de-facto networking standards, free software and commercial Internet browser. Real-time interaction and information transfer with the Halifax site are achieved independent of the technology available to the remote student. The RIL design and delivery mechanism are tailored to: i) provide a constructivist pedagogical approach; ii) model a collaborative learning environment for group interaction; iii) match the characteristics of the delivery media to specific learning processes (media-synchronicity theory) including the provision of unambiguous feedback and guidance; iv) assign appropriate instructional roles; and v) determine desirable student competency outcomes; all in a remote learning context. A 4-tier role architecture consisting of faculty, facilitators at both local and remote sites and students, has been determined appropriate and adapted to maintain academic integrity and offer the same quality of interaction as the onsite program.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265054","","Laboratories;Internetworking;Educational programs;Context modeling;Maintenance engineering;Hardware;Computational modeling;Software standards;IP networks;Collaborative work","internetworking;telecommunication engineering education;educational courses;educational institutions;distance learning;groupware;software engineering;computer science education;Internet","remote interactive laboratory;online internetworking education;online education;de-facto networking standards;free software;commercial Internet browser;real-time interaction;information transfer;remote student;delivery mechanism;constructivist pedagogical approach;collaborative learning environment;group interaction;media-synchronicity theory;student competency","","3","","33","","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the robot-active mode, the MR actuator works as a clutch to transfer the torque generated by the motor to the leg joint, providing flexible torque instantaneously for human safety and reducing the power consumption.

We address high-dimensional and complex hybrid dynamical models that represent collaborative locomotion. At the high level of the control scheme, local and nonlinear controllers, based on the virtual constraints approach, are designed to induce exponentially stable dynamic gaits. The local controller for the leash is assumed to be a nonlinear controller that keeps the human in a safe distance from the dog while following it. At the lower level, a real-time quadratic programming (QP) is solved for modifying the local controllers of the robot as well as the leash to avoid obstacles. In particular, the QP framework is set up based on control barrier functions (CBFs) to compute optimal control inputs that guarantee safety while being close to the local controllers. The stability of the complex periodic gaits is investigated through the Poincaré return map. To demonstrate the power of the analytical foundation, the control algorithms are transferred into an extensive numerical simulation of a complex model that represents cooperative locomotion of a quadrupedal robot, referred to as Vision 60, and a human model.

In order to facilitate the learning of multiple demonstrations and meanwhile generalize to new situations, a task-parameterized Gaussian mixture model (TP-GMM) has been recently developed. This model has achieved reliable performance in areas such as human-robot collaboration and dual-arm manipulation. However, the crucial task frames and associated parameters in this learning framework are often set by the human teacher, which renders three problems that have not been addressed yet: (i) task frames are treated equally, without considering their individual importance, (ii) task parameters are defined without taking into account additional task constraints, such as robot joint limits and motion smoothness, and (iii) a fixed number of task frames are pre-defined regardless of whether some of them may be redundant or even irrelevant for the task at hand. In this paper, we generalize the task-parameterized learning by addressing the aforementioned problems.

The software suite we developed has been designed specifically for organizations that cannot afford the adoption costs of more specialized and complex frameworks, developed in High Energy Physics (HEP) environment, but that still require an easy-to-use interface to the Grid. Our framework heavily relies on a bookkeeping database, storing both application-specific and infrastructure meta-data, which is tightly coupled with a web-based user-interface. The first makes available to the users information on the execution status of jobs and their specific meaning and parameters, and contributes in orchestrating the submission mechanism. The latter provides job submission management, bookkeeping database interactions, basic monitoring functionality and eLog system. Multi-site submissions based on user-defined requests and fine grain parametric submission interfaces are available. The structure of framework services follow a centralized design: job management service and bookkeeping database are hosted in a European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) site. Jobs executed into remote sites transfer their output to predefined target site repository and update the bookkeeping database. In addition, the framework requires a proper configuration of the remote Grid sites on which the jobs will run.

Design of vCLOT combines the immersivity of virtual worlds with the power of knowledge structures. Immersivity provides learners with the opportunity to make decisions at every level of the game. This transfers control of interaction to the learner, enabling the learner to be actively engaged in knowledge construction process. Knowledge structures are a neat way to represent domain and learner data. The user interface of vCLOT is designed and implemented with Open Wonderland which is an open-source 3D toolkit. The learning goal which is to learn about blood clotting process, is aligned with the game goal, which is application of blood clot process steps to heal an injury. The game goal is presented as a quest in which the learner interacts with concepts by either dragging them or synthesizing them from other concepts. Learners complete the quest on successful formation of blood clot which in turn implies that they have learnt the blood clot process. We plan to do a usability study to improve the system before starting actual intervention.","2161-377X","978-1-4673-9041-5","10.1109/ICALT.2016.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757042","Game Based Learning;Procedural Knowledge;Blood Clotting;Open Wonderland;Quest","Games;Coagulation;XML;Calcium;Ions;Education","computer aided instruction;computer games;public domain software;teaching;user interfaces;virtual reality","procedural knowledge teaching;open-source 3D toolkit;Open Wonderland;user interface;knowledge construction process;decision making;knowledge structures;immersive learning experience;game based learning environment;blood clotting process;virtual world system;vCLOT;virtual clot architecture","","","","10","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we learn to generate motions that enable WAM for holding and transporting of humans in certain rescue or patient care scenarios. We model the task as a reinforcement learning problem in order to provide a robot behavior that can directly respond to external perturbation and human motion. For this, we represent global properties of the robot-human interaction with topology-based coordinates that are computed from arm and torso positions. These coordinates also allow transferring the learned policy to other body shapes and sizes. For training and evaluation, we simulate a dynamic sea rescue scenario and show in quantitative experiments that the policy can solve unseen scenarios with differently-shaped humans, floating humans, or with perception noise. Our qualitative experiments show the subsequent transporting after holding is achieved and we demonstrate that the policy can be directly transferred to a real world setting.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794160","","Robot kinematics;Humanoid robots;Manipulators;Laplace equations;Torso;Shape","humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics;medical robotics;path planning;patient care;position control","topology-based representation;human body movement;bulky object;WAM;manipulation places;global properties;local contacts;grasping;reinforcement learning problem;robot behavior;human motion;robot-human interaction;topology-based coordinates;torso positions;learned policy;body shapes;dynamic sea rescue scenario;unseen scenarios;differently-shaped humans;whole arm manipulation","","3","","38","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Between 5% and 14% of the residential electrical power consumption is caused by devices being in standby mode. Depending on the device type, more than 50% of standby power consumption could be saved by applying state-of-the-art power management techniques. By implementing a zero energy standby design and outsourcing power consuming user interfaces, even more electrical power can be saved. Here we present a novel Near Field Communication (NFC) interfacing method for everyday electronic devices. By implementing this interface, the target device can be shut down during idle times. Thus, standby power consumption is eliminated completely. If user interaction is requested, NFC provides the electrical energy to switch on the target device's power supply and to start the device. Furthermore, any control, status, and maintenance information can be transmitted over NFC. By outsourcing high power dissipating and unoptimized user interfaces (touch screens, WiFi, etc.) to the power optimized NFC reader, further energy savings are possible also during running state. This paper demonstrates the implementation and integration of this novel interfacing technique into common consumer electronics. Two implementation approaches are presented. A simple, energy harvesting-based approach illustrates the basic working principle. The second, more sophisticated approach, enables also authentication, encrypted data transfer, user interface outsourcing, configuration and control tasks, etc. A proof of concept is demonstrated by means of an access control terminal.","2160-4894","978-1-4673-1430-5","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379085","Zero Energy Standby;NFC;RFID","Switches;Hardware;User interfaces;Home appliances;Power demand","consumer electronics;electronic engineering computing;emergency power supply;energy harvesting;near-field communication;power consumption;power supply circuits;radiofrequency identification;user interfaces","NIZE;near field communication interface method;zero energy standby;everyday electronic devices;electric devices;residential electrical power consumption;power management techniques;zero energy standby design;outsourcing power consuming user interfaces;NFC interfacing method;target device power supply;maintenance information;power optimized NFC reader;energy savings;consumer electronics;energy harvesting-based approach;encrypted data transfer;access control terminal;RFID","","4","1","18","","13 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies indicate that robot learning from demonstration (LfD) is a promising way to improve grasping performance, but complete automation of the grasping task in unforeseen circumstances remains difficult. As an alternative to LfD, this paper leverages limited human supervision to achieve robotic grasping of unknown objects in unforeseen circumstances. The technical question is what form of human supervision best minimizes the effort of the human supervisor. The approach here applies a human-supplied bounding box to focus the robot's visual processing on the target object, thereby lessening the dimensionality of the robot's computer vision processing. After the human supervisor defines the bounding box through the man-machine interface, the rest of the grasping task is automated through a vision-based feature-extraction approach where the dexterous hand learns to grasp objects without relying on pre-computed object models through the NEAT neuroevolution algorithm. Given only low-level sensing data from a commercial depth sensor Kinect, our approach evolves neural networks to identify appropriate hand positions and orientations for grasping novel objects. Further, the machine learning results from simulation have been validated by transferring the training results to a physical robot called Dreamer made by the Meka Robotics company. The results demonstrate that grasping novel objects through exploiting neuroevolution from simulation to reality is possible.","2328-1464","978-1-4799-4530-6","10.1109/CICA.2014.7013242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013242","","Grasping;Robot sensing systems;Training;Artificial neural networks;Three-dimensional displays","dexterous manipulators;feature extraction;human-robot interaction;image sensors;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neural nets;robot vision","dexterous robotic hand;robotic grasping;three-dimensional model;robot learning from demonstration;LfD;grasping task automation;human-supplied bounding box;robot visual processing;computer vision processing;man-machine interface;vision-based feature-extraction approach;NEAT neuroevolution algorithm;depth sensor;Kinect;neural networks;machine learning;physical robot;Dreamer;Meka Robotics company","","12","","27","","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, the implementation of pseudo haptic feedback to teleoperation systems reduces the requirements for kinematic structures and actuators of the used haptic user interface .In this work, we discuss the usability of pseudo haptic feedback for its application in teleoperation systems. The mechanisms of pseudo-haptic feedback are theoretically explained for an exemplary teleoperation task. Options to vary the intensity of the users pseudo haptic sensation are derived. The effect of pseudo haptic feedback for teleoperation is based on changing the input-output ratio by actual measured interaction forces at the end-effector.

Additionally, in the prosthetic setting the hand is not privy to such global knowledge including the object's shape, weight, friction properties, etc. Existing techniques from robotics that can manipulate objects in this prosthetic setting require compensation terms which are counterproductive to the manipulation task. The incorporation of tactile sensing leads to a simpler control formulation and enables relaxation of several restrictive assumptions inherent in the robotics applications.

How to use communication technologies to improve mobile learning is an important topic in electronic education. Meanwhile, media selection can be a critical issue of supporting various reader devices and providing potential benefits. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is one method of information exchange that is especially suitable for various front-end devices to read information. This paper aims to assess a ubiquitous learning environment through RSS and analyze communication media richness with RSS, SMS and E-mail based on media richness theory. Moreover, in order to evaluate the preferences toward using RSS into ubiquitous learning environment, student satisfaction is also assessed. Experimental results revealed that ubiquitous learning system by using RSS can greatly promote instructor-learners interaction and learners participation in curriculum activities but have no influence in learners cognition and metacognition. In terms of media richness, RSS is more suitable media for ubiquitous learning environment. According to the results, we suggest that current general e-learning systems can take advantage of RSS techniques to support mobile access and achieve the goal of ubiquitous learning anytime and anywhere.","1944-9410","978-1-4244-3808-2","10.1109/VECIMS.2009.5068910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068910","Ubiquitous learning;Media richness theory;RSS;Student satisfaction","Mobile communication;Information management;Communications technology;Portable computers;Virtual environment;Anthropometry;Learning systems;Cognition;Electronic learning;Information processing","computer aided instruction;electronic messaging;mobile computing;multimedia computing","RSS;media richness theory;mobile devices;mobile learning;electronic education;Really Simple Syndication;information exchange;ubiquitous learning environment;SMS;e-mail;instructor-learners interaction;learner cognition;metacognition;e-learning systems","","1","","23","","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is while commercial robots are designed with default configuration and factory settings which may often be different to an individual's operating preferences. This paper presents how reinforcement learning is applied and utilised towards personalisation of a robot's behaviour. Two-level reinforcement learning has been implemented: first level is in charge of energy autonomy, i.e. how to survive, and second level is involved in adapting robot's behaviour to user's preferences. In both levels Q-learning algorithm has been applied. First level actions have been learnt in a simulated environment and then the results have been transferred to the real robot. Second level has been fully implemented in the real robot and learnt by human-robot interaction. Finally, experiments showing the performance of the system are presented.","","978-1-4577-2138-0","10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6181679","","Robots;Batteries;Learning;Humans;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Games","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence)","robot self-preservation;user preferences adaptation;game play;personal robots;commercial robots;reinforcement learning;robot behaviour personalisation;Q-learning algorithm;human-robot interaction","","4","","28","","12 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transfer object can be freely moved in three-dimensional space by the human operator for various tasks. Although manipulation for the moving direction of a crane is easy, the crane's operation without vibration of a load is difficult for unskilled operators, and therefore swinging of the object occurs and residual vibration is generated after the transfer object reaches a goal point. Therefore, a semi-automatic control system is proposed in terms of obstacle avoidance by manual operation by human operator and feedback control for suppression of swing by automatic controller. Further, in order to heighten safety and prevent human error, the command input to avoid obstacles and go towards a goal is generated by the fusion of human command using joystick and potential information using diffusion equation based on the known environment map. Position and vibration control of a crane are carried out by a fixed-pole controller for the command input (stated previously). The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental studies.","1062-922X","0-7803-6583-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2000.886499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=886499","","Cranes;Humans;Automatic control;Control systems;Space exploration;Manuals;Feedback control;Safety;Fusion power generation;Equations","cranes;computerised control;user interfaces;human factors;interactive systems;feedback;vibration control","semi-automatic control;overhead crane control;potential method;practical industries;overhead traveling cranes;human operator;transfer object;three-dimensional space;moving direction;unskilled operators;residual vibration;obstacle avoidance;feedback control;swing suppression;automatic controller;safety;human error;command input;human command;potential information;diffusion equation;known environment map;vibration control;fixed-pole controller","","3","","6","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With robots being the main source of hazards, safety engineers use over-emphasized safety measures, and carry out lengthy and expensive risk assessment processes on each HRC-layout reconfiguration. Recent advances in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer solutions to add intelligence and comprehensibility of the environment to robots. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses deep RL as an enabling technology to enhance intelligence and safety of the robots in HRC scenarios and, thus, reduce hazards incurred by the robots. The framework offers a systematic methodology to encode the task and safety requirements and context of applicability into RL settings. The framework also considers core components, such as behavior explainer and verifier, which aim for transferring learned behaviors from research labs to industry. In the evaluations, the proposed framework shows the capability of deep RL agents learning collision-free point-to-point motion on different robots inside simulation, as shown in the supplementary video.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196924","","Task analysis;Training;Hazards;Robot sensing systems;Service robots","hazards;human-robot interaction;industrial robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;neural nets;occupational safety;risk management","hazard source;safety engineers;risk assessment processes;deep RL agents;human-robot collaboration;HRC-productivity;deep reinforcement learning;systematic methodology;core components","","1","","38","","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, matching the complexity of real-world tactile interactions is a challenging problem due to the complexity of our sense of touch. Motivated by the recognition that multi-modal haptic feedback is needed to fully recreate human touch, we created PATCH, a Pump-Actuated Thermal Compression Haptic device for presenting simultaneous thermal and compression cues. The system uses water of varying temperature to provide compression cues and transfer heat to or from the user's skin. The wearable component of the system is constructed solely of soft, flexible components. When compared to an established, unimodal, pressure-based haptic device, the PATCH system was found to perform similarly in terms of recognition and saliency, but it was rated more favorably in terms of wearability. The PATCH device can display temperatures ranging from 17° C to 42° C, fitting the desired temperatures with an R2 = 0.75, and can display pulsed cues at a rate of 0.22 Hz. The success of our PATCH system can serve to inform the development of the next generation of multi-modal haptic devices.","2324-7355","978-1-7281-0234-4","10.1109/HAPTICS45997.2020.ras.HAP20.32.c4048ec3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086319","","","force feedback;haptic interfaces;touch (physiological);virtual reality","virtual reality;multimodal haptic feedback;human touch;compression cues;PATCH system;PATCH device;pump-actuated thermal compression haptic device;thermal cues;pressure-based haptic device;frequency 0.22 Hz;temperature 17.0 degC to 42.0 degC","","","","25","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some robotic devices assist in the physical transfer of the elderly, and these robots come in contact with large surfaces of the human body. The regions of the buttock and the back may be uncomfortable due to these robotic devices. Therefore, sensing devices simulating a human buttock were developed to quantify and evaluate the load of a human body objectively. This buttock dummy consists of simulated bone and soft tissues, which include muscle, fat and skin. These regions have multi-axis force sensors to enable the quantification of the load due to the robotic devices used for nursing care. On measuring the soft exterior, it was found that the stiffness of the buttock dummy was similar to the human buttock. The comfort of a robotic bed was measured using the buttock dummy, and it was found that the shear force increased due to the deformation of the robotic bed. Thus, it was proven that the buttock dummy was capable of measuring the load of the human body when being used with robotic devices for nursing care.","2164-0580","978-1-5386-4678-6","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2017.8246960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8246960","","Bones;Buttocks;Muscles;Force;Robot sensing systems;Force sensors","force sensors;geriatrics;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;patient care","human body;robotic devices;nursing care;robotic bed;buttock dummy;human buttock","","2","","16","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Mediated perception and action in human robotic embodiment","M. Bergamasco","PERCRO, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy","19th International Symposium in Robot and Human Interactive Communication","11 Oct 2010","2010","","","1","1","Research on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence presently interprets the interaction between human and robotic subjects through a set of mediated controls who engage almost all human senses. The underlying communication requires the establishment of a set of interaction metaphors in order to allow a natural type of control. The most common of these metaphors is the kinematic copy of human gestures. During the last ten years incredible progresses in cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, physiology and neurophysiology have been achieved. The knowledge about the relationship between the “perception and sensori-motion mechanisms” and the brain has never been so advanced. One of the major outcomes is in the fact that it is possible to correlate brain neuronal activities to corresponding perception and motion, and, at the same time, it is possible to record these activities through the use of innovative devices. The combined adoption of these results does allow dissolving the physical constraints that act as a boundary during the interaction and control of robots and virtual environment entities. A new generation of brain and body (computer) interfaces (BBCI) will allow direct transfer of user intention and the realization of remote sensing. In such a way it will be possible to achieve the interactive communication with a robot without the requirement to physically perform any action. Virtual and robotic bodies can be controlled and moved even in absence of a correspondent motion of the controlling subject. The robots is moved only by thoughts while the robot perception is transferred directly to the humans through worn interfaces (Head mounted displays, skin and body stimulators,...). This lecture addresses the path from teleoperation and virtual environment interaction toward new methods to recreate the illusion of surrogating our own bodies in different entities (being robotic or virtual) and investigates how the relevant perception-action loops will be affected.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-7990-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598757","","","brain-computer interfaces;human-robot interaction;interactive systems;telerobotics","human robotic embodiment;robotics;artificial intelligence;interaction metaphors;sensori-motion mechanisms;perception mechanisms;brain neuronal activities;virtual environment;brain and body interfaces;user intention;interactive communication","","","","","","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

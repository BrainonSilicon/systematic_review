Transfer Entropy Based Causality From Head Motion To Eye Movement,"Abstract Eye movement behavior, which provides the visual information acquisition and processing, plays an important role in performing sensorimotor tasks, such as driving, by human beings in everyday life. In the procedure of performing sensorimotor tasks, eye movement is contributed through a specific coordination of head and eye in gaze changes, with head motions preceding eye movements. Notably we believe that this coordination in essence indicates a kind of causality. In this paper, we investigate transfer entropy to set up a quantity for measuring an unidirectional causality from head motion to eye movement. A normalized version of the proposed measure, demonstrated by virtual reality based psychophysical studies, behaves very well as a proxy of driving performance, suggesting that quantitative exploitation of coordination of head and eye may be an effective behaviometric of sensorimotor activity.

Remedial Training of the Less-Impaired Arm in Chronic Stroke Survivors With Moderate to Severe Upper-Extremity Paresis Improves Functional Independence: A Pilot Study,"The ipsilesional arm of stroke patients often has functionally limiting deficits in motor control and dexterity that depend on the side of the brain that is lesioned and that increase with the severity of paretic arm impairment. However, remediation of the ipsilesional arm has yet to be integrated into the usual standard of care for upper limb rehabilitation in stroke, largely due to a lack of translational research examining the effects of ipsilesional-arm intervention. We now ask whether ipsilesional-arm training, tailored to the hemisphere-specific nature of ipsilesional-arm motor deficits in participants with moderate to severe contralesional paresis, improves ipsilesional arm performance and generalizes to improve functional independence. We assessed the effects of this intervention on ipsilesional arm unilateral performance (Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test), ipsilesional grip strength, contralesional arm impairment level (Fugl-Meyer Assessment), and functional independence (Functional Independence Measure) (N = 13). Intervention occurred over a three-week period for 1.5 hours/session, 3 times each week. All sessions included virtual reality tasks that targeted the specific motor control deficits associated with either left or right hemisphere damage, followed by graded dexterity training in real-world tasks. We also exposed participants to 3 weeks of sham training to control for the non-specific effects of therapy visits and interactions. We conducted 5 test-sessions: 2 pre-tests and 3 post-tests. Our results indicate substantial improvements in the less-impaired arm performance, without detriment to the paretic arm, that transferred to improved functional independence in all three posttests, indicating durability of training effects for at least 3 weeks. We provide evidence for establishing the basis of a rehabilitation approach that includes evaluation and remediation of the ipsilesional arm in moderately to severely impaired stroke survivors. This study was originally a crossover design; however, we were unable to complete the second arm of the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the results from the first arm of the planned design as a longitudinal study.",2500682922,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Maenza, Candice;Wagstaff, David A;Varghese, Rini;Winstein, Carolee;Good, David C;Sainburg, Robert L",," University of Southern California

Cook and colleagues [5] systematically reviewed 609 studies with 35226 medical trainees and reported that medical simulation training is consistently associated with large effect sizes for outcomes in the areas of knowledge, skills, and behaviours, and moderate effects for patient-related outcomes. An additional fundamental question is whether subjective or objective performance gains, seen during VR training, will transfer into real life situations [6]. [...]investigation of the main factors that can aid effective learning transfer is needed. In our virtual simulation, we provided vibration at the top of the hand instead of torque force, a visual colour change of the bolt and the wheel instead of visible rotation and resistance forces, and increased sound intensity instead of the more complex signal change that would be observed in a real tool.",2504776513,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Cooper, Natalia;Millela, Ferdinando;Cant, Iain;White, Mark D;Meyer, Georg",," University of Liverpool

Intermanual transfer and retention of visuomotor adaptation to a large visuomotor distortion are driven by explicit processes,"About the Authors: Jean-Michel Bouchard Roles Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review &amp; editing Affiliation: School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada Erin K. Cressman Roles Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review &amp; editing * E-mail: Erin.Cressman@uOttawa.ca Affiliation: School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada ORCID logo https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6833-1840 Introduction Reaching with altered visual feedback of the hand’s position in a virtual reality environment leads to motor adaptation in the trained hand and also in the untrained hand [1–4]. The phenomenon of intermanual transfer of visuomotor adaptation has been studied in the lab by having participants reach to visual targets with a single hand while seeing a cursor on a screen that is misplaced relative to their actual hand position (e.g., the cursor’s trajectory is rotated relative to actual hand motion). To further manipulate participants’ level of awareness of the visuomotor distortion, Wang and colleagues [7] also included a third group of participants who were told about the cursor rotation (i.e., told that the cursor would be rotated 32° CCW relative to hand motion). Alternatively, recent work has demonstrated that small cursor rotations (i.e., less than 40°) lead to limited engagement of explicit processes, even when the visuomotor distortion is explained to participants in advance [18, 25]. [...]awareness of the distortion, and hence engagement of cognitive strategies to counteract a given visuomotor distortion, may have been more similar across groups than expected, making it difficult to establish the role of explicit and implicit processes in intermanual transfer of visuomotor adaptation.",2476828787,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bouchard, Jean-Michel;Cressman, Erin K",," University of Ottawa-Canada

Learning an Action-Conditional Model for Haptic Texture Generation,"Rich haptic sensory feedback in response to user interactions is desirable for an effective, immersive virtual reality or teleoperation system. However, this feedback depends on material properties and user interactions in a complex, non-linear manner. Therefore, it is challenging to model the mapping from material and user interactions to haptic feedback in a way that generalizes over many variations of the user's input. Current methodologies are typically conditioned on user interactions, but require a separate model for each material. In this paper, we present a learned action-conditional model that uses data from a vision-based tactile sensor (GelSight) and user's action as input. This model predicts an induced acceleration that could be used to provide haptic vibration feedback to a user. We trained our proposed model on a publicly available dataset (Penn Haptic Texture Toolkit) that we augmented with GelSight measurements of the different materials. We show that a unified model over all materials outperforms previous methods and generalizes to new actions and new instances of the material categories in the dataset.",2299625548,,,Working Papers,,"Heravi, Negin;Yuan, Wenzhen;Okamura, Allison M;Bohg, Jeannette",,," © 2020.

milliEgo: Single-chip mmWave Radar Aided Egomotion Estimation via Deep Sensor Fusion,"Robust and accurate trajectory estimation of mobile agents such as people and robots is a key requirement for providing spatial awareness for emerging capabilities such as augmented reality or autonomous interaction. Although currently dominated by optical techniques e.g., visual-inertial odometry, these suffer from challenges with scene illumination or featureless surfaces. As an alternative, we propose milliEgo, a novel deep-learning approach to robust egomotion estimation which exploits the capabilities of low-cost mmWave radar. Although mmWave radar has a fundamental advantage over monocular cameras of being metric i.e., providing absolute scale or depth, current single chip solutions have limited and sparse imaging resolution, making existing point-cloud registration techniques brittle. We propose a new architecture that is optimized for solving this challenging pose transformation problem. Secondly, to robustly fuse mmWave pose estimates with additional sensors, e.g. inertial or visual sensors we introduce a mixed attention approach to deep fusion. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our proposed system is able to achieve 1.3% 3D error drift and generalizes well to unseen environments. We also show that the neural architecture can be made highly efficient and suitable for real-time embedded applications.",2409424555,,,Working Papers,,"Lu, Chris Xiaoxuan;Muhamad Risqi U Saputra;Zhao, Peijun;Yasin Almalioglu;Pedro P B de Gusmao;Chen, Changhao;Sun, Ke;Trigoni, Niki;Markham, Andrew",,," © 2020.

An In-Depth Exploration of the Effect of 2D/3D Views and Controller Types on First Person Shooter Games in Virtual Reality,"The amount of interest in Virtual Reality (VR) research has significantly increased over the past few years, both in academia and industry. The release of commercial VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) has been a major contributing factor. However, there is still much to be learned, especially how views and input techniques, as well as their interaction, affect the VR experience. There is little work done on First-Person Shooter (FPS) games in VR, and those few studies have focused on a single aspect of VR FPS. They either focused on the view, e.g., comparing VR to a typical 2D display or on the controller types. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating variations of 2D/3D views in HMDs, controller types, and their interactions. As such, it is challenging to distinguish findings related to the controller type from those related to the view. If a study does not control for the input method and finds that 2D displays lead to higher performance than VR, we cannot generalize the results because of the confounding variables. To understand their interaction, we propose to analyze in more depth, whether it is the view (2D vs. 3D) or the way it is controlled that gives the platforms their respective advantages. To study the effects of the 2D/3D views, we created a 2D visual technique, PlaneFrame, that was applied inside the VR headset. Our results show that the controller type can have a significant positive impact on performance, immersion, and simulator sickness when associated with a 2D view. They further our understanding of the interactions that controllers and views have and demonstrate that comparisons are highly dependent on how both factors go together. Further, through a series of three experiments, we developed a technique that can lead to a substantial performance, a good level of immersion, and can minimize the level of simulator sickness.",2449344090,,,Working Papers,,"Monteiro, Diego;Hai-Ning Liang;Wang, Jialin;Chen, Hao;Baghaei, Nilufar",,," © 2020.

How to Improve Your Virtual Experience -- Exploring the Obstacles of Mainstream VR,"What is Virtual Reality? A professional tool, made to facilitate our everyday tasks? A conceptual mistake, accompanied by cybersickness and unsolved locomotion issues since the very beginning? Or just another source of entertainment that helps us escape from our deteriorating world? The public and scientific opinions in this respect are diverse. Furthermore, as researchers, we sometimes ask ourselves whether our work in this area is really ""worth it"", given the ambiguous prognosis regarding the future of VR. To tackle this question, we explore three different areas of VR research in this dissertation, namely locomotion, interaction, and perception. We begin our journey by structuring VR locomotion and by introducing a novel locomotion concept for large distance traveling via virtual body resizing. In the second part, we focus on our interaction possibilities in VR. We learn how to represent virtual objects via self-transforming controllers and how to store our items in VR inventories. We design comprehensive 3D gestures for the audience and provide an I/O abstraction layer to facilitate the realization and usage of such diverse interaction modalities. The third part is dedicated to the exploration of perceptual phenomena in VR. In contrast to locomotion and interaction, our contributions in the field of perception emphasize the strong points of immersive setups. We utilize VR to transfer the illusion of virtual body ownership to nonhumanoid avatars and exploit this phenomenon for novel gaming experiences with animals in the leading role. As one of our contributions, we demonstrate how to repurpose the dichoptic presentation capability of immersive setups for preattentive zero-overhead highlighting in visualizations. We round off the dissertation by coming back to VR research in general, providing a critical assessment of our contributions and sharing our lessons learned along the way.",2441394849,,,Working Papers,,"Krekhov, Andrey",,," © 2020.

Embodied virtual reality for the study of real-world motor learning,"Motor-learning literature focuses on simple laboratory-tasks due to their controlled manner and the ease to apply manipulations to induce learning and adaptation. Recently, we introduced a billiards paradigm and demonstrated the feasibility of real-world-neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and mobile-brain-imaging. Here we developed an embodied virtual-reality (VR) environment to our real-world billiards paradigm, which allows to control the visual feedback for this complex real-world task, while maintaining sense of embodiment. The setup was validated by comparing real-world ball trajectories with the trajectories of the virtual balls, calculated by the physics engine. We then ran our learning protocol in the embodied VR. Subjects played billiard shots when they held the physical cue and hit a physical ball on the table while seeing it all in VR. We found comparable learning trends in the embodied VR to those we previously reported in the physical real-world task. Embodied VR can be used for learning real-world tasks in a highly controlled environment which enables applying visual manipulations, common in laboratory-tasks and rehabilitation, to a real-world full-body task. Embodied VR enables to manipulate feedback and apply perturbations to isolate and assess interactions between specific motor-learning components, thus enabling addressing the current questions of motor-learning in real-world tasks.

Towards Fine-grained Human Pose Transfer with Detail Replenishing Network,"Human pose transfer (HPT) is an emerging research topic with huge potential in fashion design, media production, online advertising and virtual reality. For these applications, the visual realism of fine-grained appearance details is crucial for production quality and user engagement. However, existing HPT methods often suffer from three fundamental issues: detail deficiency, content ambiguity and style inconsistency, which severely degrade the visual quality and realism of generated images. Aiming towards real-world applications, we develop a more challenging yet practical HPT setting, termed as Fine-grained Human Pose Transfer (FHPT), with a higher focus on semantic fidelity and detail replenishment. Concretely, we analyze the potential design flaws of existing methods via an illustrative example, and establish the core FHPT methodology by combing the idea of content synthesis and feature transfer together in a mutually-guided fashion. Thereafter, we substantiate the proposed methodology with a Detail Replenishing Network (DRN) and a corresponding coarse-to-fine model training scheme. Moreover, we build up a complete suite of fine-grained evaluation protocols to address the challenges of FHPT in a comprehensive manner, including semantic analysis, structural detection and perceptual quality assessment. Extensive experiments on the DeepFashion benchmark dataset have verified the power of proposed benchmark against start-of-the-art works, with 12\%-14\% gain on top-10 retrieval recall, 5\% higher joint localization accuracy, and near 40\% gain on face identity preservation. Moreover, the evaluation results offer further insights to the subject matter, which could inspire many promising future works along this direction.",2407150021,,,Working Papers,,"Yang, Lingbo;Wang, Pan;Liu, Chang;Gao, Zhanning;Ren, Peiran;Zhang, Xinfeng;Wang, Shanshe;Ma, Siwei;Hua, Xiansheng;Gao, Wen",,," © 2020.

Motor learning through a non-immersive virtual task in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophies,"IIntroduction: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are neuromuscular and genetic disorders that progress with weakness and damage of the proximal muscles, developing with loss of functionality. Virtual reality environments are suggested as an effective alternative for performance of daily life activities. However, there is no evidence in the literature on the use of virtual reality in this population. Objective: Assess motor performance through a motor learning protocol in a coincident timing task. Methods: 10 participants with LGMD and 10 healthy individuals were selected and included in the study to perform a non-immersive virtual reality task divided into three phases: acquisition (20 attempts), retention (5 attempts), and transfer (5 attempts, with speed increase). Results: It is observed that the accuracy of movement improves from the beginning to the end of the acquisition (p = 0.01); however, there is a marginal difference between the groups in block A1 (p = 0.089). Regarding the variability of touches, observed by the variable error, both groups improved performance in all phases. Conclusion: Even with lower performance than the control group at the beginning of the practice, individuals with LGMD showed the potential to optimize motor function during the practice of a non-immersive virtual reality activity and were able to match their performance with the control group after a few attempts.",2504646818,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Prumes, Marcelo;Talita Dias da Silva;Camila Aparecida de Oliveira Alberissi;Capellini, Camila Miliani;Lilian Del Ciello de Menezes;João Batista Francalino da Rocha;Francis Meire Favero;Carlos Bandeira de Mello Monteiro",,," © 2020.

Perceptual uncertainty and action consequences independently affect hand movements in a virtual environment,"When we use virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) environments to investigate behaviour or train motor skills, we expect that the insights or skills acquired in VR/AR transfer to real-world settings. Motor behaviour is strongly influenced by perceptual uncertainty and the expected consequences of actions. VR/AR differ in both of these aspects from natural environments. Perceptual information in VR/AR is less reliable than in natural environments, and the knowledge of acting in a virtual environment might modulate our expectations of action consequences. Using mirror reflections to create a virtual environment free of perceptual artefacts, we show that hand movements in an obstacle avoidance task systematically differed between real and virtual obstacles and that these behavioural differences occurred independent of the quality of the available perceptual information. This suggests that even when perceptual correspondence between natural and virtual environments is achieved, action correspondence does not necessarily follow due to the disparity in the expected consequences of actions in the two environments.",2473197140,,,Scholarly Journals," University of Aberdeen, School of Psychology, Aberdeen, UK (GRID:grid.7107.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7291) , University of Aberdeen, School of Psychology, Aberdeen, UK (GRID:grid.7107.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7291) , University of St Andrews, School of Psychology and Neuroscience, St Andrews, UK (GRID:grid.11914.3c) (ISNI:0000 0001 0721 1626) , University of Aberdeen, School of Psychology, Aberdeen, UK (GRID:grid.7107.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7291)","Giesel, Martin;Nowakowska, Anna;Harris, Julie M;Hesse Constanze",,," © The Author(s) 2020.

vIS: An Immersive Virtual Storytelling System for Vocational Training,"Storytelling has been established as a proven method to effectively communicate and assist in knowledge transfer. In recent years, there has been growing interest in improving the training and learning domain by using advanced technology such as Virtual Reality (VR). However, a gap exists between storytelling and VR, and it is as yet unclear how they can be combined to form an effective system that not only maintains the level of engagement and immersion provided by VR technology but also provides the core strengths of storytelling. In this paper, we present vIS, a Vocational Immersive Storytelling system, which bridges the gap between storytelling and VR. vIS focuses on vocational training, in which users are trained on how to use a mechanical micrometer by employing a creative fictional story embedded inside a virtual manufacturing plant’s workplace. For the evaluation, a two-phase user study with 30 participants was conducted to measure the system’s effectiveness and improvements in long-term training, as well as to examine user experience against traditional methods of training—2D videos and textual manuals. The results indicate that the user’s ability to retain their training after seven days was nearly equal for vIS and the 2D video-based technique and was considerably higher than the text-based technique.",2462827122,,,Scholarly Journals,,,,," © 2020.

Recommendations for Integrating a P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface in Virtual Reality Environments for Gaming: An Update,"The integration of a P300-based brain–computer interface (BCI) into virtual reality (VR) environments is promising for the video games industry. However, it faces several limitations, mainly due to hardware constraints and limitations engendered by the stimulation needed by the BCI. The main restriction is still the low transfer rate that can be achieved by current BCI technology, preventing movement while using VR. The goal of this paper is to review current limitations and to provide application creators with design recommendations to overcome them, thus significantly reducing the development time and making the domain of BCI more accessible to developers. We review the design of video games from the perspective of BCI and VR with the objective of enhancing the user experience. An essential recommendation is to use the BCI only for non-complex and non-critical tasks in the game. Also, the BCI should be used to control actions that are naturally integrated into the virtual world. Finally, adventure and simulation games, especially if cooperative (multi-user), appear to be the best candidates for designing an effective VR game enriched by BCI technology.",2462220692,,,Scholarly Journals,,,,," © 2020.

Effects of Transient Loss of Vision on Head and Eye Movements during Visual Search in a Virtual Environment,"Central and peripheral fields of view extract information of different quality and serve different roles during visual tasks. Past research has studied this dichotomy on-screen in conditions remote from natural situations where the scene would be omnidirectional and the entire field of view could be of use. In this study, we had participants looking for objects in simulated everyday rooms in virtual reality. By implementing a gaze-contingent protocol we masked central or peripheral vision (masks of 6 deg. of radius) during trials. We analyzed the impact of vision loss on visuo-motor variables related to fixation (duration) and saccades (amplitude and relative directions). An important novelty is that we segregated eye, head and the general gaze movements in our analyses. Additionally, we studied these measures after separating trials into two search phases (scanning and verification). Our results generally replicate past on-screen literature and teach about the role of eye and head movements. We showed that the scanning phase is dominated by short fixations and long saccades to explore, and the verification phase by long fixations and short saccades to analyze. One finding indicates that eye movements are strongly driven by visual stimulation, while head movements serve a higher behavioral goal of exploring omnidirectional scenes. Moreover, losing central vision has a smaller impact than reported on-screen, hinting at the importance of peripheral scene processing for visual search with an extended field of view. Our findings provide more information concerning how knowledge gathered on-screen may transfer to more natural conditions, and attest to the experimental usefulness of eye tracking in virtual reality.",2461074337,,,Scholarly Journals,,,,," © 2020.

CLASSIE teaching – using virtual reality to incorporate medical ethics into clinical decision making,"Background Teaching medical ethics (ME) in the clinical environment is often difficult, uncalibrated and medical students get variable exposure to skilled educators. Explicit discussion of ethical dimensions of patient management is often neglected, as clinical teachers may feel inadequately skilled to do this. Methods We developed a suite of online modules. Each consisted of a clinical scenario filmed using virtual reality (VR) technology, linked to an adaptive, interactive, online tutorial which explicitly discussed the relevant ethical issues and guidelines. These were embedded in clinical placements of students to encourage the transfer of knowledge from these modules to clinical skill competency. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate these modules which examined student engagement, knowledge gains (self-perceived and measured) and user experience. We also reviewed reflections to assess the incorporation of these modules and transfer of knowledge into the clinical learning and skill development of the students. Results Engagement and self-perceived knowledge gains were extremely high. Students found these modules realistic, interesting and helpful. The measured knowledge gains (module exit quiz) were moderate. User experience was positive overall, although students were intolerant of any technical glitches. There was mixed feedback on whether the VR aspect of the clinical scenarios added value. Student reflections showed high level incorporation of these modules into clinical practice of the students and evidence of knowledge transfer (level 3 Kirkpatrick model of evaluation) in over ¾ of students. Conclusions This study showed that the use VR clinical scenarios combined with interactive online learning modules resulted in demonstrable high-level student engagement and learning gains in medical ethics and transfer of knowledge to clinical application. It standardised and ensured the student experience of high-quality educational deliverables in clinical years of medical education. This use of VR and online technology can be adapted for use in many areas of the medical curricula where we need to ensure the delivery of well calibrated, high quality, educational deliverables at scale for students.",2451867557,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Torda, Adrienne",,," © 2020.

Study on the Influence of Road Geometry on Vehicle Lateral Instability,"According to the accident analysis of vehicles in the curve, the skidding, rollover, and lateral drift of vehicles are determined as means to evaluate the lateral stability of vehicles. The utility truck of rear-wheel drive (RWD) is researched, which is high accident rate. Human-vehicle-road simulation models are established by CarSim. Through the orthogonal experiment method, the effects of different road geometries, speed, and interaction factors between road geometries on vehicle lateral stability are studied. In this paper, skidding risk of the vehicle is characterized by the Side-way Force Coefficient (SFC). Rollover risk of the vehicle is characterized by lateral acceleration and the load transfer ratio. Lateral drift risk of the vehicle is characterized by the sideslip angle of wheels. The results of orthogonal analysis reveal that the maximum tire-road friction coefficient and speed are highly significant in skidding of the vehicle. The effects of the combination of horizontal alignment and superelevation on vehicle skidding are important. The effects of horizontal alignment and speed on vehicle rollover risk are highly significant. The effects of superelevation on vehicle rollover risk are significant. The effects of the interaction of horizontal alignment and superelevation are also important on vehicles’ rollover risk. The speed and the maximum tire-road friction coefficient have highly significant effect on the vehicle’s lateral drift. The superelevation has a significant effect on the vehicle’s lateral drift. The effects of the interaction of horizontal alignment and superelevation and longitudinal slope are also important on the lateral drift of the vehicle.",2451752825,,,Scholarly Journals," South China University of Technology, School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, No. 381 Wushan Road Tianhe District, Guangzhou 510641, China , South China University of Technology, School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, No. 381 Wushan Road Tianhe District, Guangzhou 510641, China , South China University of Technology, School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, No. 381 Wushan Road Tianhe District, Guangzhou 510641, China; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA , Qilu Transportation Development Group Co., Ltd., Lixia District, Jinan, China; Shangdong Binlai Freeway Ltd., Zibo, Shandong Province, China","Yin, Yanna;Wen, Huiying;Sun, Lu;Hou, Wei",," National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--NHTSA

Digital Undergraduate Education in Dentistry: A Systematic Review,"The aim of this systematic review was to investigate current penetration and educational quality enhancements from digitalization in the dental curriculum. Using a modified PICO strategy, the literature was searched using PubMed supplemented with a manual search to identify English-language articles published between 1994 and 2020 that reported the use of digital techniques in dental education. A total of 211 articles were identified by electronic search, of which 55 articles were selected for inclusion and supplemented with 27 additional publications retrieved by manual search, resulting in 82 studies that were included in the review. Publications were categorized into five areas of digital dental education: Web-based knowledge transfer and e-learning, digital surface mapping, dental simulator motor skills (including intraoral optical scanning), digital radiography, and surveys related to the penetration and acceptance of digital education.

Transfer of motor skill between virtual reality viewed using a head-mounted display and conventional screen environments,"Background Virtual reality viewed using a head-mounted display (HMD-VR) has the potential to be a useful tool for motor learning and rehabilitation. However, when developing tools for these purposes, it is important to design applications that will effectively transfer to the real world. Therefore, it is essential to understand whether motor skills transfer between HMD-VR and conventional screen-based environments and what factors predict transfer. Methods We randomized 70 healthy participants into two groups. Both groups trained on a well-established measure of motor skill acquisition, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), either in HMD-VR or in a conventional environment (i.e., computer screen). We then tested whether the motor skills transferred from HMD-VR to the computer screen, and vice versa. After the completion of the experiment, participants responded to questions relating to their presence in their respective training environment, age, gender, video game use, and previous HMD-VR experience. Using multivariate and univariate linear regression, we then examined whether any personal factors from the questionnaires predicted individual differences in motor skill transfer between environments. Results Our results suggest that motor skill acquisition of this task occurs at the same rate in both HMD-VR and conventional screen environments. However, the motor skills acquired in HMD-VR did not transfer to the screen environment. While this decrease in motor skill performance when moving to the screen environment was not significantly predicted by self-reported factors, there were trends for correlations with presence and previous HMD-VR experience. Conversely, motor skills acquired in a conventional screen environment not only transferred but improved in HMD-VR, and this increase in motor skill performance could be predicted by self-reported factors of presence, gender, age and video game use. Conclusions These findings suggest that personal factors may predict who is likely to have better transfer of motor skill to and from HMD-VR. Future work should examine whether these and other predictors (i.e., additional personal factors such as immersive tendencies and task-specific factors such as fidelity or feedback) also apply to motor skill transfer from HMD-VR to more dynamic physical environments.",2391396610,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Juliano, Julia M;Sook-Lei Liew",,," © 2020.

Adaptive conjunctive cognitive training (ACCT) in virtual reality for chronic stroke patients: a randomized controlled pilot trial,"Background Current evidence for the effectiveness of post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation is weak, possibly due to two reasons. First, patients typically express cognitive deficits in several domains. Therapies focusing on specific cognitive deficits might not address their interrelated neurological nature. Second, co-occurring psychological problems are often neglected or not diagnosed, although post-stroke depression is common and related to cognitive deficits. This pilot trial aims to test a rehabilitation program in virtual reality that trains various cognitive domains in conjunction, by adapting to the patient’s disability and while investigating the influence of comorbidities. Methods Thirty community-dwelling stroke patients at the chronic stage and suffering from cognitive impairment performed 30 min of daily training for 6 weeks. The experimental group followed, so called, adaptive conjunctive cognitive training (ACCT) using RGS, whereas the control group solved standard cognitive tasks at home for an equivalent amount of time. A comprehensive test battery covering executive function, spatial awareness, attention, and memory as well as independence, depression, and motor impairment was applied at baseline, at 6 weeks and 18-weeks follow-up. Results At baseline, 75% of our sample had an impairment in more than one cognitive domain. The experimental group showed improvements in attention (\( {\chi}_F^2 \) (2) = 9.57, p &lt; .01), spatial awareness (\( {\chi}_F^2 \) (2) = 11.23, p &lt; .01) and generalized cognitive functioning (\( {\chi}_F^2 \) (2) = 15.5, p &lt; .001). No significant change was seen in the executive function and memory domain. For the control group, no significant change over time was found. Further, they worsened in their depression level after treatment ( T = 45, r  = .72, p &lt; .01) but returned to baseline at follow-up. The experimental group displayed a lower level of depression than the control group after treatment ( Ws = 81.5, z = − 2.76, r  = − .60, p &lt; .01) and ( Ws = 92, z = − 2.03, r  = − .44, p &lt; .05). Conclusions ACCT positively influences attention and spatial awareness, as well as depressive mood in chronic stroke patients.

What if I had a third arm? An EEG study of a supernumerary BCI system,"Motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) enables bodyless communication by means of the imagination of body movements. Since its apparition, MI-BCI has been widely used in applications such as guiding a robotic prosthesis, or the navigation in games and virtual reality (VR) environments. Although psychological experiments, such as the Rubber Hand Illusion - RHI, suggest the human ability for creating body transfer illusions, MI-BCI only uses the imagination of real body parts as neurofeedback training and control commands. The present work studies and explores the inclusion of an imaginary third arm as a part of the control commands for MI-BCI systems. It also compares the effectiveness of using the conventional arrows and fixation cross as training step (Graz condition) against realistic human hands performing the corresponding tasks from a first-person perspective (Hands condition); both conditions wearing a VR headset. Ten healthy subjects participated in a two-session EEG experiment involving open-close hand tasks, including a third arm that comes out from the chest. The EEG analysis shows a strong power decrease in the sensory-motor areas for the third arm task in both training conditions. Such activity is significantly stronger for Hands than Graz condition, suggesting that the realistic scenario can reduce the abstractness of the third arm and improve the generation of motor imagery signals. The cognitive load is also assessed both by NASA-TLX and Task Load index.",2308330709,,,Working Papers,,"Riascos Salas, Jaime A;Villa, Steeven;Anderson Maciel;Nedel, Luciana;Barone, Dante",,," © 2019.

Progressive Training for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces Using Gamification and Virtual Reality Embodiment,"This paper presents a gamified motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) training in immersive virtual reality. Aim of the proposed training method is to increase engagement, attention, and motivation in co-adaptive event-driven MI-BCI training. This was achieved using gamification, progressive increase of the training pace, and virtual reality design reinforcing the body ownership transfer (embodiment) into the avatar. From the 20 healthy participants performing 6 runs of 2-class MI-BCI training (left/right hand), 19 were trained for a basic level of MI-BCI operation, with average peak accuracy in the session equal to 75.84\%. This confirms the proposed training method succeeded in improvement of the MI-BCI skills; moreover, participants were leaving the session in high positive affect. Although the performance was not directly correlated to the degree of embodiment, subjective magnitude of the body ownership transfer illusion correlated with the abilities to modulate the sensorimotor rhythm.",2297524923,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Škola, Filip;Tinková, Simona;Liarokapis, Fotis",,," © 2019.

Board 149: Development of an Educational Wind Turbine Troubleshooting and Safety Simulator,"Development of an Educational Wind Turbine Troubleshooting and Safety Simulator Keywords : Virtual Reality, Workforce Development, Wind Energy, Troubleshooting Training, Software Development This project is developing a web-based, interactive 3D simulator for community college wind energy technician training programs. Directly contributing to the current project are two previous wind energy projects: “Wind Tech TV,” a 2010 NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) project that compiled a library of online training materials for wind turbine technician training, and “Mixed Reality Simulators for Wind Energy Education,” a U.S. Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) project that produced a series of simulators for wind energy educators and students to provide hands-on experiences and promote critical thinking. The new simulator is designed to teach troubleshooting and safety strategies, promote critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, and enhance the transfer of knowledge from classrooms to real-world situations. Learner immersion in a simulated environment and progression through numerous troubleshooting scenarios is expected to provide a better-prepared and more skilled workforce for the wind energy industry. Multiple community colleges, a wind energy company, two NSF ATE Centers, and a university research center comprise the multi-disciplinary team working on this project. Community colleges are leading the curriculum and educational module design and implementation, industry collaborators are advising on needed skills and recommended activities, and the university research center is developing the software. Data from implementation in one community college so far show a 10% score increase for students using the simulator compared to traditional instruction alone .",2314014065,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Toth, Kyle Alexander;Moreland, John;Zhou, Chenn Q;Balachandran, Anusree;Zhang, Fangzhou;Roudebush, John Claude",,," © 2019.

An Introduction to the CLICK Approach: Leveraging Virtual Reality to Integrate the Industrial Engineering Curriculum,"This work introduces a new approach called Connected Learning and Integrated Course Knowledge (CLICK). CLICK is intended to provide an integrative learning experience by leveraging Virtual Reality (VR) technology to help provide a theme to connect and transfer the knowledge of engendering concepts. Integrative learning is described as the process of creating connections between concepts (i.e., skill and knowledge) from different resources and experiences, linking theory and practice, and using a variation of platforms to help students’ understanding. In the CLICK approach, the integration is achieved by VR learning modules that serve as a platform for a common theme and include various challenges and exercises from multiple courses across the IE curriculum. Moreover, the modules will provide an immersive and realistic experience, which the authors hypothesize, will improve how the students relate what they learn in a classroom, to real-life experiences. The goals of the CLICK approach are to (i) provide the needed connection between courses and improve students’ learning, and (ii) provide the needed linkage between theory and practice through a realistic representation of systems using VR. This work presents the results from an initial usability test performed on one of the VR modules. The results from the usability test indicate that participants liked the realism of the VR module. However, there are still some areas for improvement, and future work will focus on assessing the impact of the CLICK approach on students’ learning, motivation, and preparation to be successful engineers, areas which could translate to a STEM pipeline for the future workforce.",2314006641,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Lopez, Christian Enmanuel;Ashour, Omar;Tucker, Conrad",,," © 2019.

XR: Enabling training mode in the human brain XR: Enabling training mode in the human brain,"The face of simulation-based training has greatly evolved, with the most recent tools giving the ability to create virtual environments that rival realism. At first glance, it might appear that what the training sector needs is the most realistic simulators possible, but traditional simulators are not necessarily the most efficient or practical training tools. With all that these new technologies have to offer; the challenge is to go back to the core of training needs and identify the right vector of sensory cues that will most effectively enable training mode in the human brain. Bigger and Pricier doesn't necessarily mean better. Simulation with cross-reality content (XR), which by definition encompasses virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR), is the most practical solution for deploying any kind of simulation-based training. The authors of this paper (a teacher and a technology expert) share their experiences and expose XR-specific best practices to maximize learning transfer.

Haptic Error Modulation Outperforms Visual Error Amplification When Learning a Modified Gait Pattern,"Robotic algorithms that augment movement errors have been proposed as promising training strategies to enhance motor learning and neurorehabilitation. However, most research effort has focused on rehabilitation of upper limbs, probably because large movement errors are especially dangerous during gait training, as they might result in stumbling and falling. Furthermore, systematic large movement errors might limit the participants’ motivation during training. In this study, we investigated the effect of training with novel error modulating strategies, which guarantee a safe training environment, on motivation and learning of a modified asymmetric gait pattern. Thirty healthy young participants walked in the exoskeletal robotic system Lokomat while performing a foot target-tracking task, which required an increased hip and knee flexion in the dominant leg. Learning the asymmetric gait pattern with three different strategies was evaluated: (i) No disturbance: no robot disturbance/guidance was applied, (ii) haptic error amplification: unsafe and discouraging large errors were limited with haptic guidance, while haptic error amplification enhanced awareness of small errors relevant for learning, and (iii) visual error amplification: visually observed errors were amplified in a virtual reality environment. We also evaluated whether increasing the movement variability during training by adding randomly-varying haptic disturbances on top of the other training strategies further enhances learning. We analyzed participants’ motor performance and self-reported intrinsic motivation before, during and after training. We found that training with the novel haptic error amplification strategy did not hamper motor adaptation and enhanced transfer of the asymmetric gait pattern to free walking. Training with visual error amplification, on the other hand, increased errors during training and hampered motor learning. Participants who trained with visual error amplification also reported a reduced perceived competence. Adding haptic disturbance increased the movement variability during training, but did not have a significant effect on motor adaptation, probably because training with haptic disturbance on top of visual and haptic error amplification decreased the participants’ feelings of competence.

The role of hippocampal spatial representations in contextualization and generalization of fear,"Using contextual information to predict aversive events is a critical ability that protects from generalizing fear responses to safe contexts. Animal models have demonstrated the importance of spatial context representations within the hippocampal formation in contextualization of fear learning. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to play an important role in safety learning, possibly also through the incorporation of context information. However, if contextual representations are related to context-dependent expression of fear memory in humans remains unclear. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent functional MRI combined with a cue-context conditioning paradigm within a self-navigated virtual reality environment. The environment included two buildings (Threat and Safe context), which had distinct features outside but were identical inside. Within each context, participants saw two cues (CS+, CS-). The CS+ was consistently (100% reinforcement rate) paired with an electric shock in the Threat context, but never in the Safe context. The CS- was never paired with a shock. We found robust differential skin conductance responses (SCRs; CS+ &gt; CS-) in the Threat context, but also within the Safe context, indicating fear generalization. Within the Safe context, vmPFC responses to the CS+ were larger than those in the Threat context. We furthermore found environment-specific representantions for the two contexts in the training paradigm (i.e., before conditioning took place) in the hippocampus to be related to fear expression and generalization. Namely, participants with a weak context representation (z-score &lt; 1.65) showed stronger fear generalization compared to participants with a strong context representation (z-score &gt; 1.65). Thus, a low neural representation of spatial context may explain overgeneralization of memory to safe contexts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that context-dependent regulation of fear expression engages ventromedial prefrontal pathways suggesting this involves a similar mechanism that is known to be involved in retrieval of extinction memory.",2165541645,,,Working Papers,,"De Voogd, Lycia D;Murray, Yannick P J;Barte, Ramona M;Van Der Heide, Anouk;Fernandez, Guillen;Doeller, Christian F;Hermans, Erno J",,," © 2019.

Dynamic Interactive Social Cognition Training in Virtual Reality (DiSCoVR) for social cognition and social functioning in people with a psychotic disorder: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background Problems in social functioning (e.g., unemployment, social isolation), are common in people with a psychotic disorder. Social cognition is a treatment target to improve social functioning, as it is a proximal predictor of social functioning. Social Cognition Training (SCT) improves social cognition, but may not generalize (enduringly) to social functioning, perhaps due to insufficient opportunity to practice in daily-life social situations. Using virtual reality (VR) for SCT could address this problem, as VR is customizable, accessible, and interactive. We will test the effect of a VR SCT, ‘DiSCoVR’, on social cognition and social functioning in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods In total 100 people with a psychotic disorder and deficits in social cognition will be recruited for this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to VR SCT (DiSCoVR) or VR relaxation training (VRelax; active control). DiSCoVR is a 16-session individual SCT, consisting of three modules: 1) emotion perception (recognizing facial emotions in a virtual shopping street); 2) social perception and theory of mind (observing social interactions between virtual characters and assessing their behavior, emotions and thoughts); and 3) application of higher-order social cognition in social interaction (role-playing personalized situations in VR). People receiving VRelax complete sixteen individual sessions, in which they receive psycho-education about stress, identify personal stressors, learn relaxation techniques, and explore relaxing immersive virtual environments. Assessments will be performed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are emotion perception (Ekman 60 Faces), social perception and theory of mind (The Awareness of Social Inference Test). Secondary outcomes include social functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale), experiences and social interactions in daily life (experience sampling of emotions, social participation and subjective experience of social situations), psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, perceived stress, anxiety, positive and negative symptoms) and self-esteem. Discussion To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT testing the efficacy of VR SCT. It will also investigate generalization to daily life social situations, the durability of treatment effects, and moderators and mediators of treatment success.

Locomotor skill acquisition in virtual reality shows sustained transfer to the real world,"Background Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially promising tool for enhancing real-world locomotion in individuals with mobility impairment through its ability to provide personalized performance feedback and simulate real-world challenges. However, it is unknown whether novel locomotor skills learned in VR show sustained transfer to the real world. Here, as an initial step towards developing a VR-based clinical intervention, we study how young adults learn and transfer a treadmill-based virtual obstacle negotiation skill to the real world. Methods On Day 1, participants crossed virtual obstacles while walking on a treadmill, with the instruction to minimize foot clearance during obstacle crossing. Gradual changes in performance during training were fit via non-linear mixed effect models. Immediate transfer was measured by foot clearance during physical obstacle crossing while walking over-ground. Retention of the obstacle negotiation skill in VR and retention of over-ground transfer were assessed after 24 h. Results On Day 1, participants systematically reduced foot clearance throughout practice by an average of 5 cm (SD 4 cm) and transferred 3 cm (SD 1 cm) of this reduction to over-ground walking. The acquired reduction in foot clearance was also retained after 24 h in VR and over-ground. There was only a small, but significant 0.8 cm increase in foot clearance in VR and no significant increase in clearance over-ground on Day 2. Moreover, individual differences in final performance at the end of practice on Day 1 predicted retention both in VR and in the real environment. Conclusions Overall, our results support the use of VR for locomotor training as skills learned in a virtual environment readily transfer to real-world locomotion. Future work is needed to determine if VR-based locomotor training leads to sustained transfer in clinical populations with mobility impairments, such as individuals with Parkinson’s disease and stroke survivors.",2293255655,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Kim, Aram;Schweighofer, Nicolas;Finley, James M",," University of Southern California

Automated virtual reality (VR) cognitive therapy for patients with psychosis: study protocol for a single-blind parallel group randomised controlled trial (gameChange),"Introduction Many patients with psychosis experience everyday social situations as anxiety-provoking. The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075). A key output will be a high-quality automated VR treatment for patients to overcome anxious avoidance of social situations.

"&lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; virtual rehabilitation improves motor, cognitive, and functional outcomes in adult stroke: evidence from a randomized controlled pilot study","Background Virtual reality technologies show potential as effective rehabilitation tools following neuro-trauma. In particular, the Elements system, involving customized surface computing and tangible interfaces, produces strong treatment effects for upper-limb and cognitive function following traumatic brain injury. The present study evaluated the efficacy of Elements as a virtual rehabilitation approach for stroke survivors. Methods Twenty-one adults (42–94 years old) with sub-acute stroke were randomized to four weeks of Elements virtual rehabilitation (three weekly 30–40 min sessions) combined with treatment as usual (conventional occupational and physiotherapy) or to treatment as usual alone. Upper-limb skill (Box and Blocks Test), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment and selected CogState subtests), and everyday participation (Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory) were examined before and after inpatient training, and one-month later. Results Effect sizes for the experimental group ( d  = 1.05–2.51) were larger compared with controls ( d  = 0.11–0.86), with Elements training showing statistically greater improvements in motor function of the most affected hand ( p  = 0.008), and general intellectual status and executive function ( p  ≤ 0.001). Proportional recovery was two- to three-fold greater than control participants, with superior transfer to everyday motor, cognitive, and communication behaviors. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Conclusion A course of Elements virtual rehabilitation using goal-directed and exploratory upper-limb movement tasks facilitates both motor and cognitive recovery after stroke. The magnitude of training effects, maintenance of gains at follow-up, and generalization to daily activities provide compelling preliminary evidence of the power of virtual rehabilitation when applied in a targeted and principled manner.

Data Correlation-Aware Resource Management in Wireless Virtual Reality (VR): An Echo State Transfer Learning Approach,"Providing seamless connectivity for wireless virtual reality (VR) users has emerged as a key challenge for future cloud-enabled cellular networks. In this paper, the problem of wireless VR resource management is investigated for a wireless VR network in which VR contents are sent by a cloud to cellular small base stations (SBSs). The SBSs will collect tracking data from the VR users, over the uplink, in order to generate the VR content and transmit it to the end-users using downlink cellular links. For this model, the data requested or transmitted by the users can exhibit correlation, since the VR users may engage in the same immersive virtual environment with different locations and orientations. As such, the proposed resource management framework can factor in such spatial data correlation, so as to better manage uplink and downlink traffic. This potential spatial data correlation can be factored into the resource allocation problem to reduce the traffic load in both uplink and downlink. In the downlink, the cloud can transmit 360 • contents or specific visible contents (e.g., user field of view) that are extracted from the original 360 • contents to the users according to the users' data correlation so as to reduce the backhaul traffic load. In the uplink, each SBS can associate with the users that have similar tracking information so as to reduce the tracking data size. This data correlation-aware resource management problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful transmission probability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies an instantaneous VR delay target. To solve this problem, a machine learning algorithm that uses echo state networks (ESNs) with transfer learning is introduced. By smartly transferring information on the SBS's utility, the proposed transfer-based ESN algorithm can quickly cope with changes in the wireless networking environment due to users' co",2191939294,,,Working Papers,,"Chen, Mingzhe;Saad, Walid;Yin, Changchuan;Debbah, Merouane",,," (c) 2019.

Gamification, which is the application of game-design principles to non-game contexts, is an instructional strategy with potential to enhance learning. No studies have investigated the effects of a comprehensive gamification curriculum on the acquisition of endoscopic skills among novice endoscopists. Methods and analysis Thirty-six novice endoscopists will be randomised to one of two endoscopy SBT curricula: (1) the Conventional Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive 6 hours of one-on-one simulation training augmented with expert feedback and interlaced with 4 hours of small group teaching on the theory of colonoscopy or (2) the Gamified Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive the same curriculum with integration of the following game-design elements: a leaderboard summarising participants’ performance, game narrative, achievement badges and rewards for top performance. In line with a progressive learning approach, simulation training for participants will progress from low to high complexity simulators, starting with a bench-top model and then moving to the EndoVR virtual reality simulator. Performance will be assessed at three points: pretraining, immediately post-training and 4–6 weeks after training. Assessments will take place on the simulator at all three time points and transfer of skills will be assessed during two clinical colonoscopies 4–6 weeks post-training. Mixed factorial ANOVAs will be used to determine if there is a performance difference between the two groups during simulated and clinical assessments. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained at St. Michael’s Hospital. Results of this trial will be submitted for presentation at academic meetings and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Influence of reward learning on visual attention and eye movements in a naturalistic environment: A virtual reality study,"Rewards constitute crucial signals that motivate approach behavior and facilitate the perceptual processing of objects associated with favorable outcomes in past encounters. Reward-related influences on perception and attention have been reliably observed in studies where a reward is paired with a unidimensional low-level visual feature, such as the color or orientation of a line in visual search tasks. However, our environment is drastically different and composed of multidimensional and changing visual features, encountered in complex and dynamic scenes. Here, we designed an immersive virtual reality (VR) experiment using a 4-frame CAVE system to investigate the impact of rewards on attentional orienting and gaze patterns in a naturalistic and ecological environment. Forty-one healthy participants explored a virtual forest and responded to targets appearing on either the left or right side of their path. To test for reward-induced biases in spatial orienting, targets on one side were associated with high reward, whereas those on the opposite side were paired with a low reward. Eye-movements recording showed that left-side high rewards led to subsequent increase of eye gaze fixations towards this side of the path, but no such asymmetry was found after exposure to right-sided high rewards. A milder spatial bias was also observed after left-side high rewards during subsequent exploration of a virtual castle yard, but not during route turn choices along the forest path. Our results indicate that reward-related influences on attention and behavior may be better learned in left than right space, in line with a right hemisphere dominance, and could generalize to another environment to some extent, but not to spatial choices in another decision task, suggesting some domain- or context-specificity. This proof-of-concept study also outlines the advantages and the possible drawbacks of the use of the 3D CAVE immersive platform for VR in neuroscience.",2150533340,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bourgeois, Alexia;⨯ Emmanuel Badier;Baron, Naem;Carruzzo, Fabien;Vuilleumier, Patrik",," University of Geneva

LookinGood: Enhancing Performance Capture with Real-time Neural Re-Rendering,"Motivated by augmented and virtual reality applications such as telepresence, there has been a recent focus in real-time performance capture of humans under motion. However, given the real-time constraint, these systems often suffer from artifacts in geometry and texture such as holes and noise in the final rendering, poor lighting, and low-resolution textures. We take the novel approach to augment such real-time performance capture systems with a deep architecture that takes a rendering from an arbitrary viewpoint, and jointly performs completion, super resolution, and denoising of the imagery in real-time. We call this approach neural (re-)rendering, and our live system ""LookinGood"". Our deep architecture is trained to produce high resolution and high quality images from a coarse rendering in real-time. First, we propose a self-supervised training method that does not require manual ground-truth annotation. We contribute a specialized reconstruction error that uses semantic information to focus on relevant parts of the subject, e.g. the face. We also introduce a salient reweighing scheme of the loss function that is able to discard outliers. We specifically design the system for virtual and augmented reality headsets where the consistency between the left and right eye plays a crucial role in the final user experience. Finally, we generate temporally stable results by explicitly minimizing the difference between two consecutive frames. We tested the proposed system in two different scenarios: one involving a single RGB-D sensor, and upper body reconstruction of an actor, the second consisting of full body 360 degree capture. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our system generalizes across unseen sequences and subjects.

Cross-objects user interfaces for video interaction in virtual reality museum context,"Museums are good places for learning and nowadays many museums are integrating digital media such as video and increasingly moving towards using virtual reality. In the physical world people used to seek information from object surfaces e.g. posters on the wall and this has been used as a metaphor in the virtual reality museum: numerous videos were inhabited within virtual objects and shaped cross-objects user interfaces (COUIs). However, how such interfaces perform for video interactions still needs more investigations. In this study we implemented and investigated COUIs in comparison with the conventional card-style user interfaces and the plain virtual reality user interfaces in the virtual reality museum. The results reported no significant differences in the perceived usability or learning experience between these user interfaces, except the COUIs had a lower level of satisfaction than the card-style user interfaces. However, the COUIs showed greater efficiency with shorter eye fixation durations and higher saccade frequencies, and within these COUIs instances, namely the fully-detached, semi-attached, and fully-attached COUIs, the fully-attached instance was closest to the form of interacting with physical object surfaces and it reported highest efficiency as well. Rationales behind these results and implications generalising for the future design of COUIs, are discussed.",2037264414,,,Scholarly Journals," International Design Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China , International Design Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies, Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China , Department of Computer Science and Systems, Stockholm University, Kista, Sweden , Department of Digital Media, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China , Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies, Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China; Department of Digital Media, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China","Sun, Lingyun;Zhou, Yunzhan;Hansen, Preben;Geng, Weidong;Li, Xiangdong",,," Multimedia Tools and Applications is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Artistic Style Transfer for Videos and Spherical Images,"Manually re-drawing an image in a certain artistic style takes a professional artist a long time. Doing this for a video sequence single-handedly is beyond imagination. We present two computational approaches that transfer the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence. In our first approach, we adapt to videos the original image style transfer technique by Gatys et al. based on energy minimization. We introduce new ways of initialization and new loss functions to generate consistent and stable stylized video sequences even in cases with large motion and strong occlusion. Our second approach formulates video stylization as a learning problem. We propose a deep network architecture and training procedures that allow us to stylize arbitrary-length videos in a consistent and stable way, and nearly in real time. We show that the proposed methods clearly outperform simpler baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we propose a way to adapt these approaches also to 360\[^\circ \] images and videos as they emerge with recent virtual reality hardware.",2028350119,,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Computer Science, BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany , Department of Computer Science, BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany , Department of Computer Science, BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany","Ruder, Manuel;Dosovitskiy, Alexey;Brox, Thomas",,," International Journal of Computer Vision is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

"Depth-Based Hand Pose Estimation: Methods, Data, and Challenges","Hand pose estimation has matured rapidly in recent years. The introduction of commodity depth sensors and a multitude of practical applications have spurred new advances. We provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art, focusing on hand pose estimation from a single depth frame. To do so, we have implemented a considerable number of systems, and have released software and evaluation code. We summarize important conclusions here: (1) Coarse pose estimation appears viable for scenes with isolated hands. However, high precision pose estimation [required for immersive virtual reality and cluttered scenes (where hands may be interacting with nearby objects and surfaces) remain a challenge. To spur further progress we introduce a challenging new dataset with diverse, cluttered scenes. (2) Many methods evaluate themselves with disparate criteria, making comparisons difficult. We define a consistent evaluation criteria, rigorously motivated by human experiments. (3) We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor baseline that outperforms most existing systems. This implies that most systems do not generalize beyond their training sets. This also reinforces the under-appreciated point that training data is as important as the model itself. We conclude with directions for future progress.",2024255767,,,Scholarly Journals," University of California, Irvine, USA , Univ.

Content Evaluation in Knowledge Management Systems,"The paper considers questions of development of the knowledge management concept and enhancement of enterprise business processes based on a virtual information environment and a network model of cooperation provided by professional communities. An important aspect of using professional community portals is an opportunity, within this virtual environment, to connect to and cooperate with not only corporate employees themselves, but also any external users who would be given access rights, or a part of the portal would be made public. This opens vast opportunities for realization of network cooperation of users, but also sets a relevant task to evaluate materials posted on the portal. A rationale is noted for using integrated rating evaluation of content to enhance the quality of information search and help users achieve their goals while working in the virtual information environment. To speed up search for required information and optimize workflow, an integrated system for rating evaluation of materials has been devised. It is an embedded virtual reality instrument for data analysis and processing, a neuroevolutionary system that interacts with various components and services of the virtual reality. It has allowed to automate content processing in order to acquire relevant and quality information, generate new knowledge and apply results of intellectual activities to scientific researches. Based on the values of the content parameters, the integral score is calculated for making decision on how to process the materials, and the results of user search requests are rated. Multi-criteria calculation of integral rating score is needed for optimization of operations of the information environment. Its application simplifies a number of tasks, including processing of unrequested content, transfer of content with due characteristics to storage, quality search for and rating materials, accumulation of statistics for modification of the scope of information in the information environment. The proposed algorithm of intellectual data processing can be used in any project that requires rating evaluation, automation of decision making process, intellectual search and ranking content.",2116816964,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Komleva, Nina;Dneprovskaya, Natalia;Vnukova, Tamara",,, Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Sep 2018,, Conference Proceedings,, Sep 2018,2048-8963,, English, English,," 399-406,XVII,XXI", Kidmore End,Sep-18,European Conference on Knowledge Management,2018,,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/content-evaluation-knowledge-management-systems/docview/2116816964/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,,399,,," Data analysis , Data processing , Collaboration , Virtual reality , Multiple criterion , Cooperation , Cooperation , Business process management , Decision making , Workflow , Searching , Knowledge management , Materials selection , Decision making , Management systems , Virtual environments , Integrals , Competitive advantage , Employees , Knowledge management , Intellectual capital , Decision support systems , Automation",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=proceeding&amp;atitle=Content+Evaluation+in+Knowledge+Management+Systems&amp;author=Komleva%2C+Nina%3BDneprovskaya%2C+Natalia%3BVnukova%2C+Tamara&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=399&amp;date=2018-09-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=European+Conference+on+Knowledge+Management&amp;issn=2048-8963&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aabiglobal_,ABI/INFORM Collection
Do we predict upcoming speech content in naturalistic environments?,"The ability to predict upcoming actions is a characteristic hallmark of cognition and therefore not surprisingly a central topic in cognitive science. It remains unclear, however, whether the predictive behaviour commonly observed in strictly controlled lab environments generalizes to rich, everyday settings. In four virtual reality experiments, we tested whether a well-established marker of linguistic prediction (i.e. anticipatory eye movements as observed in the visual world paradigm) replicated when increasing the naturalness of the paradigm by means of i) immersing participants in naturalistic everyday scenes, ii) increasing the number of distractor objects present, iii) manipulating the location of referents in central versus peripheral vision, and iv) modifying the proportion of predictable nounreferents in the experiment. Robust anticipatory eye movements were observed, even in the presence of 10 objects (hereby testing working memory) and when only 25% of all sentences contained a visually present referent (hereby testing error-based learning). The anticipatory effect disappeared, however, when referents were placed in peripheral vision. Together, our findings suggest that working memory may play an important role in predictive processing in everyday communication, but only in contexts where upcoming referents have been explicitly attended to prior to encountering the spoken referential act. Methodologically, our study confirms that ecological validity and experimental control may go hand in hand in future studies of human predictive behaviour.",2068417789,,,Working Papers,,"Heyselaar, Evelien;Peeters, David;Hagoort, Peter",,," �� 2018.

Recommendations for Integrating a P300-Based Brain Computer Interface in Virtual Reality Environments for Gaming,"The integration of a P300-based brain–computer interface (BCI) into virtual reality (VR) environments is promising for the video games industry. However, it faces several limitations, mainly due to hardware constraints and constraints engendered by the stimulation needed by the BCI. The main limitation is still the low transfer rate that can be achieved by current BCI technology. The goal of this paper is to review current limitations and to provide application creators with design recommendations in order to overcome them. We also overview current VR and BCI commercial products in relation to the design of video games. An essential recommendation is to use the BCI only for non-complex and non-critical tasks in the game. Also, the BCI should be used to control actions that are naturally integrated into the virtual world. Finally, adventure and simulation games, especially if cooperative (multi-user) appear the best candidates for designing an effective VR game enriched by BCI technology.",2125317691,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Cattan, Grégoire;Mendoza, Cesar;Andreev, Anton;Congedo, Marco",," Google Inc

"The Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study (ACES) for Community-Dwelling Older Adults With or At-Risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): Neuropsychological, Neurobiological and Neuroimaging Outcomes of a Randomized Clinical Trial","Prior research has found that cognitive benefits of physical exercise and brain health in older adults may be enhanced when mental exercise is interactive simultaneously, as in exergaming. It is unclear whether the cognitive benefit can be maximized by increasing the degree of mental challenge during exercise. This randomized clinical trial (RCT), the Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise Study (ACES) sought to replicate and extend prior findings of added cognitive benefit from exergaming to those with or at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ACES compares the effects of six months of an exer-tour (virtual reality bike rides) with the effects of a more effortful exer-score (pedaling through a videogame to score points). Fourteen community-dwelling older adults meeting screening criteria for MCI (sMCI) were adherent to their assigned exercise for six months. The primary outcome was executive function, while secondary outcomes included memory and everyday cognitive function. Exer-tour and exer-score yielded significant moderate effects on executive function (Stroop A/C; d’s = .51 and .47); there was no significant interaction effect. However, after three months the exer-tour revealed a significant and moderate effect, while exer-score showed little impact, as did a game-only condition. Both exer-tour and exer-score conditions also resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory. Effects appear to generalize to self-reported everyday cognitive function. Pilot data, including salivary biomarkers and structural MRI, were gathered at baseline and six months; exercise dose was associated with increased BDNF as well as increased grey matter volume in the PFC and ACC. Improvement in memory was associated with an increase in the DLPFC. Improved executive function was associated with increased expression of exosomal miRNA-9. Interactive physical and cognitive exercise (both high and low mental challenge) yielded similarly significant cognitive benefit for adherent sMCI exercisers over six months. A larger RCT is needed to confirm these findings. Further innovation and clinical trial data are needed to develop accessible, yet engaging and effective interventions to combat cognitive decline for the growing MCI population.",2300664280,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Anderson-Hanley, Cay;Barcelos, Nicole M;Zimmerman, Earl A;Gillen, Robert W;Dunnam, Mina;Cohen, Brian D;Yerokhin, Vadim;Miller, Kenneth E;Hayes, David J;Arciero, Paul J;Maloney, Molly;Kramer, Arthur F",," Alzheimers Association

Generic HRTFs May be Good Enough in Virtual Reality. Improving Source Localization through Cross-Modal Plasticity,"Auditory spatial localization in humans is performed using a combination of interaural time differences, interaural level differences, as well as spectral cues provided by the geometry of the ear. To render spatialized sounds within a virtual reality (VR) headset, either individualized or generic Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are usually employed. The former require arduous calibrations, but enable accurate auditory source localization, which may lead to a heightened sense of presence within VR. The latter obviate the need for individualized calibrations, but result in less accurate auditory source localization. Previous research on auditory source localization in the real world suggests that our representation of acoustic space is highly plastic. In light of these findings, we investigated whether auditory source localization could be improved for users of generic HRTFs via cross-modal learning. The results show that pairing a dynamic auditory stimulus, with a spatio-temporally aligned visual counterpart, enabled users of generic HRTFs to improve subsequent auditory source localization. Exposure to the auditory stimulus alone or to asynchronous audiovisual stimuli did not improve auditory source localization. These findings have important implications for human perception as well as the development of VR systems as they indicate that generic HRTFs might be enough to enable good auditory source localization in VR.",2306211494,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Berger, Christopher C;Gonzalez-Franco, Mar;Tajadura-Jiménez, Ana;Florencio, Dinei;Zhang, Zhengyou",,," © 2018.

Text Entry in Immersive Head-Mounted Display-based Virtual Reality using Standard Keyboards,"We study the performance and user experience of two popular mainstream text entry devices, desktop keyboards and touchscreen keyboards, for use in Virtual Reality (VR) applications. We discuss the limitations arising from limited visual feedback, and examine the efficiency of different strategies of use. We analyze a total of 24 hours of typing data in VR from 24 participants and find that novice users are able to retain about 60% of their typing speed on a desktop keyboard and about 40-45\% of their typing speed on a touchscreen keyboard. We also find no significant learning effects, indicating that users can transfer their typing skills fast into VR. Besides investigating baseline performances, we study the position in which keyboards and hands are rendered in space. We find that this does not adversely affect performance for desktop keyboard typing and results in a performance trade-off for touchscreen keyboard typing.",2071304978,,,Working Papers,,"Grubert, Jens;Witzani, Lukas;Ofek, Eyal;Pahud, Michel;Kranz, Matthias;Kristensson, Per Ola",,," © 2018.

Towards a Model of User Experience in Immersive Virtual Environments,"There are increasing new advances in virtual reality technologies as well as a rise in learning virtual environments for which several studies highlighted the pedagogical value, knowledge transfer, and learners’ engaged-behaviors. Moreover, the notion of user experience is now abundant in the scientific literature without the fact that there are specific models for immersive environments. This paper aims at proposing and validating a model of User eXperience in Immersive Virtual Environment, including virtual learning environments. The model is composed of 10 components extracted from existing models (i.e., presence, engagement, immersion, flow, usability, skill, emotion, experience consequence, judgement, and technology adoption). It was validated in a user study involving 152 participants who were asked to use the edutainment application Think and Shoot and to complete an immersive virtual environment questionnaire. The findings lead us to a modified user experience model questioning new paths between user experience components (e.g., the influence of experience consequence on flow).",2111080137,,,Scholarly Journals," Arts et Métiers ParisTech, LAMPA EA 1427, 2 bd du Ronceray, 49000 Angers, France , Arts et Métiers ParisTech, LAMPA EA 1427, 2 bd du Ronceray, 49000 Angers, France , Université de Picardie Jules Verne, CRP-CPO EA 7273, chemin du Thil, 80025 Amiens, France , Université Bretagne Loire, LIUM EA 4023, avenue Olivier Messiaen, 72085 Le Mans, France , Arts et Métiers ParisTech, LAMPA EA 1427, 2 bd du Ronceray, 49000 Angers, France","Tcha-Tokey, Katy;Christmann, Olivier;Loup-Escande, Emilie;Loup, Guillaume;Richir, Simon",,," Copyright © 2018 Katy Tcha-Tokey et al.

Validation of wearable visual feedback for retraining foot progression angle using inertial sensors and an augmented reality headset,"Background Gait retraining interventions using real-time biofeedback have been proposed to alter the loading across the knee joint in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Despite the demonstrated benefits of these conservative treatments, their clinical adoption is currently obstructed by the high complexity, spatial demands, and cost of optical motion capture systems. In this study we propose and evaluate a wearable visual feedback system for gait retraining of the foot progression angle (FPA). Methods The primary components of the system are inertial measurement units, which track the human movement without spatial limitations, and an augmented reality headset used to project the visual feedback in the visual field. The adapted gait protocol contained five different target angles ranging from 15 degrees toe-out to 5 degrees toe-in. Eleven healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill, and the protocol was performed using both an established laboratory visual feedback driven by optical motion capture, and the proposed wearable system. Results and conclusions The wearable system tracked FPA with an accuracy of 2.4 degrees RMS and ICC=0.94 across all target angles and subjects, when compared to an optical motion capture reference. In addition, the effectiveness of the biofeedback, reflected by the number of steps with FPA value ±2 degrees from the target, was found to be around 50% in both wearable and laboratory approaches. These findings demonstrate that retraining of the FPA using wearable inertial sensing and visual feedback is feasible with effectiveness matching closely an established laboratory method. The proposed wearable setup may reduce the complexity of gait retraining applications and facilitate their transfer to routine clinical practice.",2089733221,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Karatsidis, Angelos;Richards, Rosie E;Konrath, Jason M;Josien C van den Noort;H Martin Schepers;Bellusci, Giovanni;Harlaar, Jaap;Veltink, Peter H",,," Copyright ©  2018.

"Can Driving-Simulator Training Enhance Visual Attention, Cognition, and Physical Functioning in Older Adults?","Virtual reality offers a good possibility for the implementation of real-life tasks in a laboratory-based training or testing scenario. Thus, a computerized training in a driving simulator offers an ecological valid training approach. Visual attention had an influence on driving performance, so we used the reverse approach to test the influence of a driving training on visual attention and executive functions. Thirty-seven healthy older participants (mean age: 71.46 ± 4.09; gender: 17 men and 20 women) took part in our controlled experimental study. We examined transfer effects from a four-week driving training (three times per week) on visual attention, executive function, and motor skill. Effects were analyzed using an analysis of variance with repeated measurements. Therefore, main factors were group and time to show training-related benefits of our intervention. Results revealed improvements for the intervention group in divided visual attention; however, there were benefits neither in the other cognitive domains nor in the additional motor task. Thus, there are no broad training-induced transfer effects from such an ecologically valid training regime. This lack of findings could be addressed to insufficient training intensities or a participant-induced bias following the cancelled randomization process.",2002922416,,,Scholarly Journals," Institute of Physiology and Anatomy, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany , Institute of Physiology and Anatomy, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany , Institute of Training and Computer Science in Sport, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany , Institute of Training and Computer Science in Sport, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany","Haeger, Mathias;Bock, Otmar;Memmert, Daniel;Hüttermann, Stefanie",,," Copyright © 2018 Mathias Haeger et al.; This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.", 10.1155/2018/7547631, Journal Article,,2018,2090-2204,, English, English,,, New York,2018,Journal of Aging Research,2018,2018,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/can-driving-simulator-training-enhance-visual/docview/2002922416/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,,,,," Laboratories , Neurosciences , Psychology , Computer & video games , Older people , Cognitive ability , Memory , Age , Studies , Visual task performance , Cognition & reasoning , Germany",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Can+Driving-Simulator+Training+Enhance+Visual+Attention%2C+Cognition%2C+and+Physical+Functioning+in+Older+Adults%3F&amp;author=Haeger%2C+Mathias%3BBock%2C+Otmar%3BMemmert%2C+Daniel%3BH%C3%BCttermann%2C+Stefanie&amp;volume=2018&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Aging+Research&amp;issn=2090-2204&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database
Exploring the Virtuality Continuum for Complex Rule-Set Education in the Context of Soccer Rule Comprehension,"We present an exploratory study to assess the benefits of using Augmented Reality (AR) in training sports rule comprehension. Soccer is the chosen context for this study due to the wide range of complexity in the rules and regulations. Observers must understand and holistically evaluate the proximity of players in the game to the ball and other visual objects, such as the goal, penalty area, and other players. Grounded in previous literature investigating the effects of Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios on transfer of training (ToT), we explore how three different interfaces influence user perception using both qualitative and quantitative measures. To better understand how effective augmented reality technology is when combined with learning systems, we compare results on the effects of learning outcomes in three interface conditions: AR, VR and a traditional Desktop interface. We also compare these interfaces as measured by user experience, engagement, and immersion. Results show that there were no significance difference among VR and AR; however, these participants outperformed the Desktop group which needed a higher number of adaptations to acquire the same knowledge.",2124655134,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Vargas González, Andrés N;Kapalo, Katelynn;Seng Lee Koh;LaViola, Joseph J",,," © 2017.

The Need for Conceptual Models of Technology in Training and Development: How Immersive Does Training Need to Be?,"Morelli, Potosky, Arthur, and Tippins (2017) articulate a strong need for industrial and organizational (I-O) psychologists to develop a more theory-based understanding of the role of technology in employee selection and assessment. We agree with their concerns but argue that this issue should include examination of how technology impacts training also. Researchers have noted that training is increasingly important for firms, and technology-enhanced training can improve learning and transfer (Ford &amp; Meyer, 2013). However, the arguments that the authors make about the need for a theory-driven approach for examining the impact of technology on selection applies to training outcomes as well. Although considerable evidence exists that workplace training is effective and that technology can impact the success of training, there has been less theory-driven research exploring how technology can enhance or detract from training success. Researchers have already identified several variables related to technology that promote learning, but one variable that remains consistently unexplored in the organizational literature is immersion. This research is particularly important given how increasingly accessible immersive technology, such as virtual reality (VR), is becoming.

To accomplish these ambitious goals, the National Research Council (2012) of the United States recommends the use of “deeper learning” classroom strategies. These include case-based learning, multiple representations of knowledge, collaborative learning, apprenticeships, life-wide learning, learning for transfer, interdisciplinary studies, personalized learning, connected learning, and diagnostic assessments. Immersive media (virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, mixed and augmented realities) have affordances that enhance this type of learning. EcoXPT is an inquiry-based middle school curriculum on ecosystem science that invites students into immersive experimentation with scaffolding tools that support deeper learning. This includes a case-based approach situated in an unfolding eutrophication scenario in which students learn new information from their observations over space and time, speaking with virtual characters in the world, and gathering information in the field guide and other sources. Diagnostic assessments of students’ progress are based on multiple sources, including process data from various types of logfiles. Multiple varied forms of representation convey perceptual, graphical, and experimental data, enabling students to investigate relationships between variables. Students are apprenticed in the ways of knowing of ecosystems scientists, which involves interdisciplinary knowledge. Students collaborate in teams of two, subdividing the tasks of gathering evidence.",1968974479,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Dede, Chris;Grotzer, Tina A;Kamarainen, Amy;Metcalf, Shari",,," © 2017.

Learning better by repetition or variation? Is transfer at odds with task specific training?,"Objective Transfer of motor skills is the ultimate goal of motor training in rehabilitation practice. In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Method One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6–10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. Results ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to. Conclusion Based on these findings, we conclude that motor skills acquired in the VR environment, transfers to real world contexts in similar proportions for both TD and DCD children. The type of practice adopted does not seem to influence children’s ability to transfer skills acquired in an exergame to life situations but the number of identical elements does.",1880542232,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bonney, Emmanuel;Lemke, Dorothee Jelsma;Ferguson, Gillian D;Bouwien C M Smits-Engelsman",,," © 2017 Bonney et al.

Learning to Act by Predicting the Future,"We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation enables learning without a fixed goal at training time, and pursuing dynamically changing goals at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.",2075345803,,,Working Papers,,"Dosovitskiy, Alexey;Koltun, Vladlen",,," © 2017.

Improvements in motor tasks through the use of smartphone technology for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"Background: In individuals severely affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), virtual reality has recently been used as a tool to enhance community interaction. Smartphones offer the exciting potential to improve communication, access, and participation, and present the unique opportunity to directly deliver functionality to people with disabilities. Objective: To verify whether individuals with DMD improve their motor performance when undertaking a visual motor task using a smartphone game. Patients and methods: Fifty individuals with DMD and 50 healthy, typically developing (TD) controls, aged 10–34 years participated in the study. The functional characterization of the sample was determined through Vignos, Egen Klassifikation, and the Motor Function Measure scales. To complete the task, individuals moved a virtual ball around a virtual maze and the time in seconds was measured after every attempt in order to analyze improvement of performance after the practice trials. Motor performance (time to finish each maze) was measured in phases of acquisition, short-term retention, and transfer. Results: Use of the smartphone maze game promoted improvement in performance during acquisition in both groups, which remained in the retention phase. At the transfer phases, with alternative maze tasks, the performance in DMD group was similar to the performance of TD group, with the exception of the transfer to the contralateral hand (nondominant). However, the group with DMD demonstrated longer movement time at all stages of learning, compared with the TD group. Conclusion: The practice of a visual motor task delivered via smartphone game promoted an improvement in performance with similar patterns of learning in both groups. Performance can be influenced by task difficulty, and for people with DMD, motor deficits are responsible for the lower speed of execution. This study indicates that individuals with DMD showed improved performance in a short-term motor learning protocol using a smartphone. We advocate that this technology could be used to promote function in this population.",2231011506,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Capelini, Camila Miliani;Talita Dias da Silva;Tonks, James;Watson, Suzanna;Mayra Priscila Boscolo Alvarez;Lilian Del Ciello de Menezes;Francis Meire Favero;Fátima Aparecida Caromano;Massetti, Thais;Carlos Bandeira de Mello Monteiro",,," © 2017.

A Study on Interaction of Gaze Pointer-Based User Interface in Mobile Virtual Reality Environment,"This research proposes a gaze pointer-based user interface to provide user-oriented interaction suitable for the virtual reality environment on mobile platforms. For this purpose, a mobile platform-based three-dimensional interactive content is produced to test whether the proposed gaze pointer-based interface increases user satisfaction through the interactions in a virtual reality environment based on mobile platforms. The gaze pointer-based interface-the most common input method for mobile virtual reality content-is designed by considering four types: the visual field range, the feedback system, multi-dimensional information transfer, and background colors. The performance of the proposed gaze pointer-based interface is analyzed by conducting experiments on whether or not it offers motives for user interest, effects of enhanced immersion, provision of new experience, and convenience in operating content. In addition, it is verified whether any negative psychological factors, such as VR sickness, fatigue, difficulty of control, and discomfort in using contents are caused. Finally, through the survey experiment, this study confirmed that it is possible to design different ideal gaze pointer-based interface in mobile VR environment according to presence and convenience.",1951960735,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Kim, Mingyu;Lee, Jiwon;Jeon, Changyu;Kim, Jinmo",,, Copyright MDPI AG 2017, 10.3390/sym9090189, Journal Article,,2017,,9, English, English,,, Basel,2017,Symmetry,2017,9,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/study-on-interaction-gaze-pointer-based-user/docview/1951960735/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,,189,,," Visual fields , User interface , Information transfer , Virtual reality , Platforms , User satisfaction , Discomfort , Virtual reality , Psychological factors , Virtual environments",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=A+Study+on+Interaction+of+Gaze+Pointer-Based+User+Interface+in+Mobile+Virtual+Reality+Environment&amp;author=Kim%2C+Mingyu%3BLee%2C+Jiwon%3BJeon%2C+Changyu%3BKim%2C+Jinmo&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=189&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Symmetry&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database
Short-term motor learning through non-immersive virtual reality task in individuals with down syndrome,"Background Down syndrome (DS) has unique physical, motor and cognitive characteristics. Despite cognitive and motor difficulties, there is a possibility of intervention based on the knowledge of motor learning. However, it is important to study the motor learning process in individuals with DS during a virtual reality task to justify the use of virtual reality to organize intervention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the motor learning process in individuals with DS during a virtual reality task. Methods A total of 40 individuals participated in this study, 20 of whom had DS (24 males and 8 females, mean age of 19 years, ranging between 14 and 30 yrs.) and 20 typically developing individuals (TD) who were matched by age and gender to the individuals with DS. To examine this issue, we used software that uses 3D images and reproduced a coincidence-timing task. Results The results showed that all individuals improved performance in the virtual task, but the individuals with DS that started the task with worse performance showed higher difference from the beginning. Besides that, they were able to retain and transfer the performance with increase of speed of the task. Conclusion Individuals with DS are able to learn movements from virtual tasks, even though the movement time was higher compared to the TD individuals. The results showed that individuals with DS who started with low performance improved coincidence- timing task with virtual objects, but were less accurate than typically developing individuals.",1894173839,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Carlos Bandeira de Mello Monteiro;Talita Dias da Silva;de Abreu, Luiz Carlos;Fregni, Felipe;Vieira de Araujo, Luciano;Fernando Henrique Inocencio Borba Ferreira;Leone, Claudio",,, Copyright BioMed Central 2017, 10.1186/s12883-017-0852-z, Journal Article,,2017,,, English, English,,, London,2017,BMC Neurology,2017,17,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/short-term-motor-learning-through-non-immersive/docview/1894173839/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,, n/a,,," Motor ability , Computer applications , Down syndrome , Three dimensional imaging , Motor skill learning , Age , Cognitive ability , Virtual reality , Motor task performance , Keyboards , Down's syndrome , Skills"," Down syndrome , Virtual reality , Rehabilitation , User-computer interface , Physical therapy modalities",,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Short-term+motor+learning+through+non-immersive+virtual+reality+task+in+individuals+with+down+syndrome&amp;author=Carlos+Bandeira+de+Mello+Monteiro%3BTalita+Dias+da+Silva%3Bde+Abreu%2C+Luiz+Carlos%3BFregni%2C+Felipe%3BVieira+de+Araujo%2C+Luciano%3BFernando+Henrique+Inocencio+Borba+Ferreira%3BLeone%2C+Claudio&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=BMC+Neurology&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database
Interactive 3-D Software in Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Training,"As the nexus between aviation, fire science, and emergency management becomes increasingly more complex, technology can be used to augment training and avoid risk while maintaining authenticity with situational reality. In Aircraft Rescue &amp; Fire Fighting (ARFF), the manner in which the learning content is effectively imparted to the student-professional can make all the difference in a successful emergency response. The interactive 3-D software developed exclusively for Dallas/Fort Worth Fire Training Research Center (DFW FTRC) is part of a curriculum designed to educated and train ARFF professionals in life-saving strategies and tactics. Through a 2013 Memorandum of Understanding, the world’s leading aviation and aerospace university, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), and DFW FTRC have created a unique partnership for the conduct of research to explore emerging issues in the discipline. Researchers from ERAU designed this collaborative study to examine how effectively the DFW FTRC virtual technology software in the classroom translated knowledge and accelerated haptic skill transfer to the hands-on portion of ARFF training at the facility. The qualitative approach integrated classroom observations with key informant interviews to create a single-case study exploratory research strategy. Emergent themes led to a richer understanding of experiential learning, particularly key differences among individual student characteristics and instructional culture that influence student proficiency and attitudes. Most noteworthy were: a larger interest among international over domestic students, age/generational difficulties with new technology, and an apprehension among ARFF professionals to transition from traditional tabletop exercises to virtual reality. Variability also existed within the instructional culture, including inconsistencies of software integration in the classroom, instructor proficiency with the software, and adult and group teaching theories. The study also found that knowledge and accelerated haptic skill transfer were positively associated with the virtual reality software, and that interactive participation and memory reinforcement were supported by the findings. Time required for curriculum development advancing further integration of the software into the training program was a significant administrative and operational challenge. Software recommendations included options that allow scenario-specific applications and variable incident conditions, thus enriching each classroom learning experience. Marketing of this software remains the final task for DFW FTRC, as cost-effective distribution could revolutionize training across public safety. Future research should also evaluate pedagogy to categorize learning constructivism using simulator-based and software-supported education and training. How this may be applied to public safety professions where risk is an inherent part of training is a crucial need in the industry.",2424162745,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Gorman, Mary K;Rita ""Rene"" I.

Towards active lower limb prosthetic systems: design issues and solutions,"  A prosthesis is a crucial technical substitute that should restore biomechanical function and body integrity for people with lower limb loss or congenital limb absence [1]. Within the last decades, lower limb prostheses developed from passive mechanisms to adaptive mechatronic systems [2]. Contemporary, such prostheses evolve to robotic systems providing powered locomotion support by drives as shown in [3, 4]. According to the review in from [5], 21 different active lower limb prostheses are found in the research literature. With such technologies, various new research questions arise and the idea of prosthesis technology simulation is being discussed [6, 7]. Technically, the mechatronic design of actuators and kinematics as well as the development of suitable control algorithms are challenging tasks [3, 4]. A promising approach to actuation is found in compliant actuators and kinematics that store and transfer energy between gait phases [8]. To command those actuators, controllers that mimic biological function during different gait situations, speeds, and transitions as the one propose by Grimmer et al. [9] are required. Analyzing human biomechanics with and without considering the prosthetic system is a crucial basis for design and control that provides requirements and constrains [10]. Further, biomechanical studies can be used to assess the utility of active prostheses and indicate that those improve amputee gait [3, 11]. As prostheses are not only used by people, but aim at replacing lost parts of amputees' bodies, human factors show significant impact on prosthetic development from a psychological perspective [12-14]. Those comprise aspects such as acceptance [15] and integration to the body schema [16-20]. Those human factors impact technical design [21, 22] and need psychological methods to be surveyed [23-25] and considered in design [26]. Additionally, insights regarding human factors can be used to develop and improve novel techniques for movement rehabilitation, e.g., gait training in virtual reality environments [27-29]. The articles in this supplement contribute to those topics by tackling elastic actuation, gait recognition and control, biomechanical analysis and simulation, human factors, and virtual reality rehabilitation.",1854764558,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Christ, Oliver;Beckerle, Philipp",,, Copyright BioMed Central 2016, 10.1186/s12938-016-0283-x, Journal Article,,2016,,, English, English,,, London,2016,Biomedical Engineering Online,2016,15,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/towards-active-lower-limb-prosthetic-systems/docview/1854764558/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,, n/a,,,,,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Towards+active+lower+limb+prosthetic+systems%3A+design+issues+and+solutions&amp;author=Christ%2C+Oliver%3BBeckerle%2C+Philipp&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Biomedical+Engineering+Online&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database
New Perspectives for Engineering Education – About the Potential of Mixed Reality for Learning and Teaching Processes,"New Perspectives for Engineering Education – About the Potential of Mixed Reality for Learning and Teaching Processes In the field of Digital Humanities, one important aspect lies on the process of knowledge gain and knowledge transfer. In that context, the majority of Mixed Reality scenarios have been mainly the subject of game engines. 'Mixed Reality'describes the combination of virtual environments and natural user interfaces.Here, the user's field of view is controlled by his natural head movements via ahead mounted display. Data gloves e.g. allow direct interaction with virtual objects and omnidirectional treadmills enable unrestricted navigation through a virtual environment by natural walking movements. Other tools as 3-Dimensional joysticks or sensor-enhanced clothes may come into play.To evaluate perspectives and potential for the use of Mixed Reality settings within academic education a study was carried out, focusing on the impact of immersion and flow on cognitive processes. Therefor a quasi-experimental design was chosen as the selection of the participants (major group: students of mechanical engineering) of the study could not be randomized completely. A Mixed-Reality-Simulator (Virtual Theater) is used which combines two natural user interfaces: ahead mounted display (HMD) and an omnidirectional floor. To assess the effects of natural user interfaces on cognitive processes, a two-group-plan (treatment and control group) was established. The Mixed-Reality-Simulator (Virtual Theatre)was used as main stimulus of the treatment group whereas the control group used a laptop as interaction device. The learning environment was kept constant over both groups. The data were collected and interpreted with quantitative methods.Constraints of data collection consist as the influence of the hardware can only be evaluated within a set of independent variables, which consists of a combination of different user interfaces to a Mixed-Reality-Simulator. Thereby not all of the disruptive factors could be eliminated.In this paper the study and the detailed results are described, which showed advantages especially regarding affective and motivational factors of virtual environments for cognitive processes.

Detecting early egocentric and allocentric impairments deficits in Alzheimer’s disease: an experimental study with virtual reality,"Several studies have pointed out that egocentric and allocentric spatial impairments are one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is less clear how a break in the continuous interaction between these two representations may be a crucial marker to detect patients who are at risk to develop dementia. The main objective of this study is to compare the performances of participants suffering from amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI group), patients with AD (AD group) and a control group (CG), using a virtual reality-based procedure for assessing the abilities in encoding, storing and syncing different spatial representations. In the first task, participants were required to indicate on a real map the position of the object they had memorized, while in the second task they were invited to retrieve its position from an empty version of the same virtual room, starting from a different position. The entire procedure was repeated across three different trials, depending on the object location in the encoding phase. Our finding showed that aMCI patients performed significantly more poorly in the third trial of the first task, showing a deficit in the ability to encode and store an allocentric viewpoint independent representation. On the other hand, AD patients performed significantly more poorly when compared to the control group in the second task, indicating a specific impairment in storing an allocentric viewpoint independent representation and then syncing it with the allocentric viewpoint dependent representation. Furthermore, data suggested that these impairments are not a product of generalized cognitive decline or of general decay in spatial abilities, but instead may reflect a selective deficit in the spatial organization Overall, these findings provide an initial insight into the cognitive underpinnings of amnestic impairment in aMCI and AD patient exploiting the potentiality of virtual reality.",2301549695,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Serino, Silvia;Morganti, Francesca;Di Stefano, Fabio;Riva, Giuseppe",,," © 2015.

Towards virtual training of emotion regulation,"For professionals in military and law enforcement domains, learning to regulate one’s emotions under threatening circumstances is crucial. The STRESS project envisions a virtual reality-based system to enable such professionals to train their emotion regulation skills. To explore the possibilities for such a system, this article describes an experiment performed to investigate the impact of virtual training on participants’ experienced emotional responses in threatening situations. A set of 15 participants were asked to rate the subjective emotional intensity of a set of affective pictures at two different time points, separated by 6&#xa0;h. The participants were divided into three groups: the first group performed a session of virtual training in between, in which they received a choice-reaction task; the second group performed a session of virtual training, in which they had to apply reappraisal strategies; and a control group, that did not have any training session. The results indicate that the reappraisal-based training caused the participants in that group to give significantly lower ratings for the emotional intensity of the negative pictures, whereas the content-based training resulted in significantly higher ratings compared to the group without training. Moreover, a second experiment, performed with the same participants 6&#xa0;months later, indicated that these effects are fairly persistent over time, and that they transfer to different pictures with similar characteristics.",1987980618,,,Scholarly Journals," Agent Systems Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands , Agent Systems Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement, Amsterdam, The Netherlands , Agent Systems Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement, Amsterdam, The Netherlands , Agent Systems Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Bosse, Tibor;Gerritsen, Charlotte;de Man, Jeroen;Treur, Jan",,," Brain Informatics is a copyright of Springer, (2014).

A case study of user immersion-based systematic design for serious heritage games,"Modern digital technologies support the preservation and transfer of cultural heritage information via devices and applications such as digital storage systems, electronic books and virtual museums. Advances in virtual and augmented reality, real-time computer graphics and computer games have made it possible to construct large virtual environments in which users may experience cultural heritage through a variety of interactions and immersions. Thus, an emerging problem is to implement an appropriate systematic design method for achieving various types of entertainment, learning and information transfer. This paper proposes two important design factors that impact on user immersion in serious heritage games: user interface space volume and subsystem sequence. The impact of the two factors on proposed systematic design methods was investigated through comparative studies by implementing a serious heritage game system on three different platforms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",1285319113,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Chen, Shengnan;Pan, Zhigeng;Zhang, Mingmin;Shen, Huaqing",,, Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013, 10.1007/s11042-011-0864-4," Feature , Case Study",, Feb 2013,1380-7501,3, English,,, 633-658, Dordrecht,Feb-13,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2013,62,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/case-study-user-immersion-based-systematic-design/docview/1285319113/se-2?accountid=14664," 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 1220 Social trends & culture , 5240 Software & systems"," 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 1220 Social trends & culture , 5240 Software & systems"," Equations , References"," 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 1220 Social trends & culture , 5240 Software & systems",,633," 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 1220 Social trends & culture , 5240 Software & systems",," Computer & video games , Studies , User interface , Culture",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=A+case+study+of+user+immersion-based+systematic+design+for+serious+heritage+games&amp;author=Chen%2C+Shengnan%3BPan%2C+Zhigeng%3BZhang%2C+Mingmin%3BShen%2C+Huaqing&amp;volume=62&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=633&amp;date=2013-02-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Multimedia+Tools+and+Applications&amp;issn=1380-7501&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aabiglobal_,ABI/INFORM Collection
The role of simulation in the development of technical competence during surgical training: a literature review,"  To establish the current state of knowledge on the effect of surgical simulation on the development of technical competence during surgical training. Using a defined search strategy, the medical and educational literature was searched to identify empirical research that uses simulation as an educational intervention with surgical trainees. Included studies were analysed according to guidelines adapted from a Best Evidence in Medical Education review. A total of 32 studies were analysed, across 5 main categories of surgical simulation technique - use of bench models and box trainers (9 studies); Virtual Reality (14 studies); human cadavers (4 studies); animal models (2 studies) and robotics (3 studies). An improvement in technical skill was seen within the simulated environment across all five categories. This improvement was seen to transfer to the real patient in the operating room in all categories except the use of animals. Based on current evidence, surgical trainees should be confident in the effects of using simulation, and should have access to formal, structured simulation as part of their training. Surgical simulation should incorporate the use of bench models and box trainers, with the use of Virtual Reality where resources allow. Alternatives to cadaveric and animal models should be considered due to the ethical and moral issues surrounding their use, and due to their equivalency with other simulation techniques. However, any use of surgical simulation must be tailored to the individual needs of trainees, and should be accompanied by feedback from expert tutors.

Teaching the Blind to Find Their Way by Playing Video Games,"Computer based video games are receiving great interest as a means to learn and acquire new skills. As a novel approach to teaching navigation skills in the blind, we have developed Audio-based Environment Simulator (AbES); a virtual reality environment set within the context of a video game metaphor. Despite the fact that participants were naïve to the overall purpose of the software, we found that early blind users were able to acquire relevant information regarding the spatial layout of a previously unfamiliar building using audio based cues alone. This was confirmed by a series of behavioral performance tests designed to assess the transfer of acquired spatial information to a large-scale, real-world indoor navigation task. Furthermore, learning the spatial layout through a goal directed gaming strategy allowed for the mental manipulation of spatial information as evidenced by enhanced navigation performance when compared to an explicit route learning strategy. We conclude that the immersive and highly interactive nature of the software greatly engages the blind user to actively explore the virtual environment. This in turn generates an accurate sense of a large-scale three-dimensional space and facilitates the learning and transfer of navigation skills to the physical world.",1344575936,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Merabet, Lotfi B;Connors, Erin C;Halko, Mark A;Sánchez, Jaime",," Harvard Medical School

Is Learning in Low Immersive Environments Carried over to High Immersive Environments?,"  One of the more debated issues regarding training simulators is their validity for transfer of skills to sensory environments that differ from the simulator. In two experiments, the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) and collocated (Col) visual displays were evaluated in a realistic and complex visuomotor task. The two factors were evaluated independently, comparing Col-2D with dislocated-2D (experiment 1) and with Col-3D (experiment 2). As expected, in both cases the more immersive presentation condition facilitated better performance. Furthermore, improvement following training in the more immersive condition carried over to the following less immersive condition but there was no carry over in the opposing order of presentation. This is taken as an indication for the differential development of skills conditioned by the level of immersiveness of the training environment. This further suggests that learning of complex realistic tasks is not carried over from less immersive simulator to the complex sensory environment of reality, due to the large gap in sensory patterns.",1069235611,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Dror David Lev;Reiner, Miriam",,," Copyright © 2012 Dror David Lev and Miriam Reiner.

Revealing Context-Specific Conditioned Fear Memories with Full Immersion Virtual Reality,"The extinction of conditioned fear is known to be context specific, and often referred to as more robustly contextually bound than the fear memory itself (Bouton, 2004). Yet, recent findings in rodents have challenged the notion that contextual fear retention is initially generalized. The context specificity of a cued-fear memory to the learning context has not been addressed in the human literature largely due to limitations in methodology. Here we adapt a novel technology to test the context specificity of cued fear conditioning using full immersion 3-dimensional virtual reality (VR). During acquisition training, healthy participants navigated through virtual environments containing dynamic snake and spider conditioned stimuli (CSs), one of which was paired with electrical wrist stimulation. During a 24-hour delayed retention test, one group returned to the same context as acquisition training whereas another group experienced the CSs in a novel context. Unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings were assayed on-line during fear acquisition as an index of contingency awareness. Skin conductance responses (SCR) time-locked to CS onset were the dependent measure of cued fear, and skin conductance levels during the interstimulus interval were an index of context fear. Findings indicate that early in acquisition training, participants express contingency awareness as well as differential contextual fear, whereas differential cued fear emerged later in acquisition. During the retention test, differential cued fear retention was enhanced in the group who returned to the same context as acquisition training relative to the context shift group. The results extend recent rodent work to illustrate differences in cued and context fear acquisition and the contextual specificity of recent fear memories. Findings support the use of full immersion VR as a novel tool in cognitive neuroscience to bridge rodent models of contextual phenomena underlying human clinical disorders.",2298755425,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Huff, Nicole;Alba Hernandez, Jose;Fecteau, Matthew;Zielinski, David;Brady, Rachael;LaBar, Kevin S",," Duke University

The transfer from survey (map-like) to route representations into Virtual Reality Mazes: effect of age and cerebral lesion,"  Abstract Background: To go from one place to another, we routinely generate internal representations of surrounding spaces, which can include egocentric (body-centred) and allocentric (world-centred) coordinates, combined into route and survey representations. Recent studies have shown how both egocentric and allocentric representations exist in parallel and are joined to support behaviour according to the task. Our study investigated the transfer from survey (map-like) to route representations in healthy and brain-damaged subjects. The aim was two-fold: first, to understand how this ability could change with age in a sample of healthy participants, aged from 40 to 71 years old; second, to investigate how it is affected after a brain lesion in a 8 patients' sample, with reference to specific neuropsychological frames. Methods: Participants were first required to perform the paper and pencil version of eight mazes, then to translate the map-like paths into egocentric routes, in order to find the right way into equivalent Virtual Reality (VR) mazes. Patients also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, including a specific investigation of some topographical orientation components. Results: As regards the healthy sample, we found age-related deterioration in VR task performance. While education level and gender were not found to be related to performance, global cognitive level (Mini Mental State Examination), previous experience with computer and fluidity of navigation into the VR appeared to influence VR task results. Considering the clinical sample, there was a difficulty in performing the VR Maze task; executive functions and visuo-spatial abilities deficits appeared to be more relevant for predicting patients' results. Conclusions: Our study suggests the importance of developing tools aimed at investigating the survey to route transfer ability in both healthy elderly and clinical samples, since this skill seems high cognitive demanding and sensitive to cognitive decline. Human-computer interaction issues should be considered in employing new technologies, such as VR environments, with elderly subjects and neurological patients.",902387408,21281510,,Scholarly Journals,,"Carelli, Laura;Rusconi, Maria Luisa;Scarabelli, Chiara;Stampatori, Chiara;Mattioli, Flavia;Riva, Giuseppe",,," © 2011 Carelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Transfer of Skill from a Virtual Reality Trainer to Real Juggling,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate transfer of training from a virtual reality environment that captures visual and temporal-spatial aspects of juggling, but not the motor demands of juggling. Transfer of skill to real juggling was examined by comparing juggling performance of novices that either experienced both the virtual training protocol and real juggling practice, or only practiced real juggling. After ten days of training, participants who have alternated between real and virtual training demonstrated comparable performance to those who only practiced real juggling. Moreover, they adapted better to instructed changes in temporal-spatial constraints. These results imply that juggling relevant skill subcomponents can be trained in the virtual environment, and support the notion that cognitive aspects of a skill can be separately trained to enhance the acquisition of a complex perceptual-motor task.

Human Perception Test of Discontinuous Force and a Trial of Skill Transfer Using a Five-Fingered Haptic Interface,"In the transferring of expert skills, it takes a great deal of time and effort for beginners to obtain new skills, and it is difficult to teach the skills by using only words. For those reasons, a skill transfer system that uses virtual reality (VR) and a haptic interface technique is very attractive. In this study, we investigated the human perception of fingertip force with respect to the following changes: (1) the spatial change of the presented force, and (2) the change of the time to present the force. Based on the results of the perception experiments, we considered the skill transfer to a person's five fingers by using a five-fingered haptic interface robot.",856030996,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Endo, Takahiro;Kanno, Tomohiro;Kobayashi, Mana;Kawasaki, Haruhisa",,," Copyright © 2010 Takahiro Endo et al.

Usability of a virtual reality environment simulating an automated teller machine for assessing and training persons with acquired brain injury,"  Doc number: 19 Abstract Objective: This study aimed to examine the usability of a newly designed virtual reality (VR) environment simulating the operation of an automated teller machine (ATM) for assessment and training. Design: Part I involved evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of a non-immersive VR program simulating an ATM (VR-ATM). Part II consisted of a clinical trial providing baseline and post-intervention outcome assessments. Setting: A rehabilitation hospital and university-based teaching facilities were used as the setting. Participants: A total of 24 persons in the community with acquired brain injury (ABI) - 14 in Part I and 10 in Part II - made up the participants in the study. Interventions: In Part I, participants were randomized to receive instruction in either an ""early"" or a ""late"" VR-ATM program and were assessed using both the VR program and a real ATM. In Part II, participants were assigned in matched pairs to either VR training or computer-assisted instruction (CAI) teaching programs for six 1-hour sessions over a three-week period. Outcome Measures: Two behavioral checklists based on activity analysis of cash withdrawals and money transfers using a real ATM were used to measure average reaction time, percentage of incorrect responses, level of cues required, and time spent as generated by the VR system; also used was the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination. Results: The sensitivity of the VR-ATM was 100% for cash withdrawals and 83.3% for money transfers, and the specificity was 83% and 75%, respectively. For cash withdrawals, the average reaction time of the VR group was significantly shorter than that of the CAI group (p = 0.021). We found no significant differences in average reaction time or accuracy between groups for money transfers, although we did note positive improvement for the VR-ATM group. Conclusion: We found the VR-ATM to be usable as a valid assessment and training tool for relearning the use of ATMs prior to real-life practice in persons with ABI.",1643288423,20429955,,Scholarly Journals,,"Fong, Kenneth NK;Chow, Kathy YY;Chan, Bianca CH;Lam, Kino CK;Lee, Jeff CK;Li, Teresa HY;Yan, Elaine WH;Wong, Asta TY",,," © 2010 Fong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Kidney cancer website www.rak-nerki.pl (in Polish) as an accomplishment of the idea of progress,"  The idea of progress has been associated with a certain version of progressivism which stems from directional transformation, which means the change from a given state to another one. Therefore, a practical interpretation embraces leaving the state of primary cultural poverty, ignorance, and sense of being lost to higher levels of civilization. The idea of progress still plays pivotal roles in the development of modern medicine, which has triumphed for many years. To make real rules that present the heart of the idea of progress is possible only when civilizational progress has earlier come true. So it is not possible to gain innovations (in fact, they are the markers of progress) in medicine without cultural development, appearance of new technology, and social development. The internet is a worldwide network of connected computers which cooperate with each other at the level of data transfer. Physicians are a part of modern society or postmodern society, and like the rest of humans, they are changed similarly to others. Additionally, physicians bear responsibility for a high quality of work. The internet appears to be a good medium to exchange information which can be used for interpersonal communication, enter-tainment, education, business activity or industrial production purposes. Profes-sional internet portals give possibilities to make a virtual reality that is able to exist due to a virtual community. The latter consists of real humans working in various professions, for instance physicians. An individual person (e.g. a physician) is a part of the professional network. Further individual progress ensures that a given physician will be a crucial element of the network through his or her skills to get necessary data or to make professional databases broader.",1237582395,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Wcislo, Gabriel",,, Copyright Termedia Publishing House 2008,, Journal Article,,2008,1428-2526,7," English , Polish", English,,, Poznan,2008,Wspólczesna Onkologia,2008,12,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/kidney-cancer-website-www-rak-nerki-pl-polish-as/docview/1237582395/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,,338,,,,,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Kidney+cancer+website+www.rak-nerki.pl+%28in+Polish%29+as+an+accomplishment+of+the+idea+of+progress&amp;author=Wcislo%2C+Gabriel&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=338&amp;date=2008-08-10&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Wsp%C3%B3lczesna+Onkologia&amp;issn=1428-2526&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apubliccontent_,Publicly Available Content Database
An Approach for Assessing Training Effectiveness in Virtual Reality Environments,Virtual reality environments fall within the spectrum of training technologies currently available to promote knowledge transfer and skill development. The strength of virtual environments lies in their ability to portray the real-world operational system as an interactive multimodal environment. The degree of the similarity between the operational and virtual environments is typically described as system fidelity. We propose a statistical approach to assess the knowledge transfer and skill development by comparing the degree of theoretical mismatch between the virtual training environment and the actual operational environment based on physical cue fidelity and neurophysiological response mismatch. The proposed approach also enables identification of potential causes of response mismatches and provides systematic guidance to reduce the number of mismatch occurrences.

Learning Effectiveness As A Function Of The Technologies Employed In Online Learning Settings,"Technology is often viewed as an important factor that impacts the effectiveness of online learning systems. To explore the importance of various technologies, the authors conducted a comprehensive study that investigates the experiences of students and instructors that are involved in online learning. A number of questionnaires concerning perceptions, experiences, resources, and perceived effectiveness related to online education developed by the research team have been administered to a sample of students (over 4,500) at a large number of educational institutions throughout the United States. Survey participants constitute a large sample group that represents diverse backgrounds from geographically dispersed institutions worldwide. Responses were analyzed and discussed in the paper. The analysis focuses on the utilization of technology in online education and explores how students view its effectiveness as a function of the types of technologies used. Study covers various standard technologies such as instant messaging, email, discussion boards, chat rooms, web conference, audio communication, and electronic whiteboard as well as the use of relatively new virtual reality based environments. A comparative analysis was also conducted to identify the differences between face-to-face and online learning settings. Based on the findings of the analysis and the data gathered from the survey participants, a number of design methods and techniques that would influence the development of effective online course delivery systems are developed. This study is the first step in a longer program of research that will ultimately yield enhanced systems for online learning. Effectiveness of online learning settings has become an important research question as the number of online programs increase dramatically in the last decade. Numerous researchers studied the effectiveness of online education. Since the research problem has multiple dimensions, different researchers focused on different aspects of online learning. For example, some researchers have studied the effectiveness of online learning by focusing on its implications on performance in work place. Lima et al. studied the determinants of effective online training to reveal how these variables affect learning performance and transfer performance, two important elements of training effectiveness in the workplace. Their study shows that effective online education (OE) systems need ease of interaction, computer self-efficacy, and efficient communication in the virtual perspective as well as institutional factors such as support of seniors and continuous learning culture1. The question of how to assess the effectiveness of online education is a challenging one by itself. Rovai2 proposed a framework that is designed to assess student performance, determine program and cost effectiveness, monitor quality of technology and support",2317751588,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Erol Ozan;Tabrizi, Mohammad;Wuensch, Karl;Aziz, Shahnaz;Kishore, Masao",,," © 2007.

The Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) - towards a new communication channel for online control in gaming applications,"  Issue Title: Special issue on Distributed Adaptation, Representation and Processing of Multimedia Information; Guest Editors: Horace H S Ip and Shu-Ching Chen The investigation of innovative Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) provides a challenge for future multimedia research and development. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) exploit the ability of human communication and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular communication channels. In general, BCIs offer a possibility of communication for people with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or spinal cord injury. Beyond medical applications, a BCI conjunction with exciting multimedia applications, e.g., a dexterity game, could define a new level of control possibilities also for healthy customers decoding information directly from the user's brain, as reflected in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals which are recorded non-invasively from user's scalp. This contribution introduces the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) and presents setups where the user is provided with intuitive control strategies in plausible gaming applications that use biofeedback. Yet at its beginning, BBCI thus adds a new dimension in multimedia research by offering the user an additional and independent communication channel based on brain activity only. First successful experiments already yielded inspiring proofs-of-concept. A diversity of multimedia application models, say computer games, and their specific intuitive control strategies, as well as various Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios are now open for BCI research aiming at a further speed up of user adaptation and increase of learning success and transfer bit rates.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",757118702,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Krepki, Roman;Blankertz, Benjamin;Curio, Gabriel;Müller, Klaus-robert",,," Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007", 10.1007/s11042-006-0094-3, Feature,, Apr 2007,1380-7501,1, English, English,, 73-90, Dordrecht,Apr-07,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2007,33,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/berlin-brain-computer-interface-bbci-towards-new/docview/757118702/se-2?accountid=14664, 5400 Research & development, 5400 Research & development,, 5400 Research & development,,73, 5400 Research & development,," Communication channels , Research & development--R&D",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=The+Berlin+Brain-Computer+Interface+%28BBCI%29+-+towards+a+new+communication+channel+for+online+control+in+gaming+applications&amp;author=Krepki%2C+Roman%3BBlankertz%2C+Benjamin%3BCurio%2C+Gabriel%3BM%C3%BCller%2C+Klaus-robert&amp;volume=33&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=73&amp;date=2007-04-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Multimedia+Tools+and+Applications&amp;issn=1380-7501&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aabiglobal_,ABI/INFORM Collection
Aircraft Maintenance Technology Education: Integrating Asynchronous Technology &amp;amp; Virtual Reality,"Aircraft Maintenance Technology Education: Integrating Asynchronous Technology and Virtual Reality Abstract This paper describes a research program with an objective to develop and implement an interactive virtual reality (VR) model of the aircraft inspection maintenance process for asynchronous delivery. Existing approaches have not been able to mimic accurately the complexity of the aircraft maintenance process, reporting limited transfer capabilities and student preparedness for the workplace. This use of virtual reality technology will enable educators to create and students to experience the complex aircraft maintenance environment in an educational classroom, a setting where it has not yet been successfully created using traditional multimedia-based technologies. This model will emphasize the curriculum development and workplace preparedness needed by modern aircraft maintenance technology for local, state and national audiences. The primary objectives of this research are curriculum enhancement and assessment of VR as a pedagogical tool. This innovative approach is the first effort to extend tested VR technology to the aircraft maintenance technology curriculum in a two-year college. The outcome of this research will lead to the following: an innovative, high-impact model for curriculum application in aircraft maintenance technology for college students and industry employees; an increased workplace pool of aircraft maintenance technicians prepared for the transition from learning to workforce; a program providing the use of VR technology as a pedagogical tool. The successful completion of this effort will fill a state and national need for well-prepared students entering the aircraft maintenance industry and will provide a better understanding of the use of VR as a pedagogical tool. 1.",2317714538,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Sadasivan, Sajay;Vembar, Deepak;Stringfellow, Paris;Washburn, Carl;Duchowski, Andrew;Gramopadhye, Anand",,," © 2006.

Efficacy of a Virtual Reality Simulator for Evaluating the Aptitude of Medical Students,"OBJECTIVE Our goal was to develop a system using virtual reality (VR) technology to test the haptic skills of medical students. Currently, surgical skills are learned on live patients in a clinical environment in which the student practices under the close supervision of an experienced surgeon. We are interested in using haptic feedback devices to enhance surgical skills, because simulated touch in a virtual world improves the performance of trainee surgeons. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a test that evaluates the surgical skill of medical students by using a VR simulator. METHODS We used a microsurgical simulator with a force‐feedback system. Its effectiveness in helping 36 medical students to acquire the tactile skills used in microscopic surgery was evaluated experimentally. Operating time and the number of sites of hemorrhage were measured to evaluate surgical aptitude. We also evaluated system performance with respect to reality, immersiveness, and operability as secondary measures. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods. RESULTS The operating time and number of hemorrhagic sites were positively correlated. Subject students were clustered into three groups: dexterous, awkward, or clumsy. The relation between the number of hemorrhages in the retina and immersion and operability differed between the group of would‐be surgeons and those of would‐be internists and pediatricians. All the students commented that the simulator was a useful tool for medical education. CONCLUSIONS The VR simulator can be used not only to teach and evaluate subtle tactile and surgical skills relevant to the surgical profession, but also to test the aptitude of medical students. The training transfer from a haptic simulator to actual practice methodology should be quantifiable in the near future. This work has steered medical informatics research into a new type of medical education.",2333552894,,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Medical Informatics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan , Department of Medical Informatics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan , Department of Medical Informatics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan , Department of Medical Informatics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan , Department of Medical Informatics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan","Oyama, Hiroshi;Kuroda, Tomohiro;Hori, Kenta;Nakamura, Takehiko;Takahashi, Takashi",,," Copyright John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Immersive 4D Interactive Visualization of Large-Scale Simulations,"In dense clusters a bewildering variety of interactions between stars can be observed, ranging from simple encounters to collisions and other mass-transfer encounters. With faster and special-purpose computers like GRAPE, the amount of data per simulation is now exceeding 1TB. Visualization of such data has now become a complex 4D data-mining problem, combining space and time, and finding interesting events in these large datasets. We have recently starting using the virtual reality simulator, installed in the Hayden Planetarium in the American Museum for Natural History, to tackle some of these problem. This work (http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo/amnh/) reports on our first ``observations'', modifications needed for our specific experiments, and perhaps field ideas for other fields in science which can benefit from such immersion. We also discuss how our normal analysis programs can be interfaced with this kind of visualization.",2092589787,,,Working Papers,,"Teuben, Peter;Hut, Piet;Levy, Stuart;Makino, Jun;McMillan, Steve;Simon Portegies Zwart;Shara, Mike;Carter Emmart",,," © 2001.

How getting close to your subjects makes qualitative data better,"The act of assessing what are good data-- both in terms of what researchers find and how they find it-therefore becomes an evaluation of the product of the interaction between the researcher, the phenomenon, and people under consideration, and the data being gathered. [...]it makes sense that more intense interactions strengthen end products in qualitative research. [...]my favorite part of the book that came from the study is the vignettes that start each chapter. Reality for critical scholars is grounded in historical realism-a virtual reality shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, ethnic, and gender values and crystallized over time (Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1994). [...]history is the basis of knowledge and provides a platform from which critical scholars can generalize about the world. [...]interpretive scholars base their work on understanding multiple realities and believe that researchers create findings as the investigation proceeds, rather than discover them (as in the positivist tradition) or mediate them (as in the critical tradition).",218851560,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Toma, J Douglas", THPRAC,," Copyright Ohio State University, College of Education Summer 2000",, PERIODICAL,, Summer 2000,0040-5841,3, English,,,177, Columbus,Summer 2000,Theory into Practice,2000,39,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-getting-close-your-subjects-makes-qualitative/docview/218851560/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,,177,,," Handbooks , Higher education , Researchers , Traditions , Subjectivity , Qualitative research , Objectivity , Studies , Social sciences , Bias , Qualitative research , Politics , Thousand Oaks California",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=How+getting+close+to+your+subjects+makes+qualitative+data+better&amp;author=Toma%2C+J+Douglas&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=177&amp;date=2000-07-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Theory+into+Practice&amp;issn=0040-5841&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Apq1litjournals_,ProQuest One Literature

Outdoor-based experiential training: Improving transfer of training using virtual reality,"In the UK, outdoor-based experiential training is a popular technique for training managers. This approach directly involves participants in the training process. The programs offer training in a fresh and motivating setting, tend to eliminate many of the role conflicts from day-to-day work settings, and emphasize many of the interpersonal skills so important in today's work setting. To help add value to these programs, virtual reality training has been introduced. While not for all organizations, virtual reality training re-creates the participant's own work environment in a developmental setting and helps to increase the transfer of training to the work setting. Unlike traditional training programs, which appear to focus on securing a compromise solution for both parties, virtual reality activities focus on the win-win scenario, in which both parties stand to gain from the activity.",216345880,922671,,Scholarly Journals,,"Wagner, Richard J;Campbell, John",,, Copyright MCB University Press Limited 1994, 10.1108/02621719410063350, Journal Article,,1994,0262-1711,7, English,,,4, Bradford,1994,The Journal of Management Development,1994,13,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/outdoor-based-experiential-training-improving/docview/216345880/se-2?accountid=14664," 9175 Western Europe , 6200 Training & development"," 9175 Western Europe , 6200 Training & development",," 9175 Western Europe , 6200 Training & development",,4," 9175 Western Europe , 6200 Training & development",," Virtual reality , Advantages , Management training , Leadership , Training , United Kingdom--UK",,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Outdoor-based+experiential+training%3A+Improving+transfer+of+training+using+virtual+reality&amp;author=Wagner%2C+Richard+J%3BCampbell%2C+John&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=4&amp;date=1994-08-10&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Journal+of+Management+Development&amp;issn=0262-1711&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aabiglobal_00922671,ABI/INFORM Collection
Facial Electromyography-based Adaptive Virtual Reality Gaming for Cognitive Training,"Cognitive training has shown promising results for delivering improvements in human cognition related to attention, problem solving, reading comprehension and information retrieval. However, two frequently cited problems in cognitive training literature are a lack of user engagement with the training programme, and a failure of developed skills to generalise to daily life. This paper introduces a new cognitive training (CT) paradigm designed to address these two limitations by combining the benefits of gamification, virtual reality (VR), and affective adaptation in the development of an engaging, ecologically valid, CT task. Additionally, it incorporates facial electromyography (EMG) as a means of determining user affect while engaged in the CT task. This information is then utilised to dynamically adjust the game's difficulty in real-time as users play, with the aim of leading them into a state of flow. Affect recognition rates of 64.1% and 76.2%, for valence and arousal respectively, were achieved by classifying a DWT-Haar approximation of the input signal using kNN. The affect-aware VR cognitive training intervention was then evaluated with a control group of older adults. The results obtained substantiate the notion that adaptation techniques can lead to greater feelings of competence and a more appropriate challenge of the user's skills.",2401515059,,,Working Papers,,"Reidy, Lorcan;Chan, Dennis;Nduka, Charles;Gunes, Hatice",,," © 2020.

Simulation training in vitreoretinal surgery: a systematic review,"Background The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the current literature on simulator-based training in vitreoretinal surgery (VRS). We examined the results regarding simulated VRS and provided an overview of how the current results may be employed in VRS training. Lastly, we evaluated the quality of these results. Methods The databases of Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for articles in English involving simulated VRS training. A qualitative analysis was performed, since the studies which met our inclusion criteria did not allow for a quantitative meta-analysis. Results We identified 203 articles of which seven met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six studies investigated simulation with EyeSi® Surgical (VRMagic, Mannheim, Germany). Six studies reported positive performance curves. Four studies showed construct validity. One study attempted to show skill transfer from simulator to vitrectomies performed on cadavers. Methodological quality of the included studies was moderate but lacking in instrument validation. Conclusion Simulator-based training in VRS can assess and possibly assist acquisition of a variety of VRS skills. Further research is needed to support transfer from simulator to operating room. Future studies should strive to follow established validation frameworks and streamline study designs.",2211229541,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Rasmussen, Rasmus Christian;Grauslund, Jakob;Anna Stage Vergmann",,," © 2019.

The effect of sports VR training for improving human body composition,"The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of sports virtual training with applied sports science and information and communication technology (ICT) for adults. We have developed a 4-week workout program that focuses on improving basic endurance, strength, and function. The experiment is to derive the kinematic data for ergonomic evaluation of indoor sports device combined with a virtual image and to compare and evaluate the pre- and post-body composition. Twenty-one participants were selected, and each training program was conducted considering individual differences and levels. Results showed that 4-week sports virtual reality (VR) training program developed in this study turned out to be appropriate as a sport VR training one to improve body composition and health.

Virtual and Remote Functionality Development for Undergraduate Laboratory,"Virtual and Remote Functionality Development for Undergraduate Laboratory A particular challenge for online education in engineering is how to extend the traditionalhands-on laboratories over internet. Especially for Engineering Technology department, itslecture course is always accompanied by a corresponding laboratory session, in which hands-onexperiments allows students to experience the backbone of science and engineering, observingdynamic phenomena, testing hypotheses, learning from mistakes, and reaching conclusions. Online laboratories can be generally categorized in two approaches: the virtual laboratoryallows students to log on a simulated environment residing on the server; the remote laboratoryallows students to remotely control the real components or instruments from any places withinternet access. These two approaches can be generalized as VR-Lab (Virtual and RemoteLaboratory). By sharing VR-Labs with other institutions, it can drastically reduce the cost ofexperimental facilities, and increase the availability of diversified setups. Also, VR-lab can bevisited by students 7/24 via internet, avoiding complex logistics like staff, scheduling, as well ascommute. In response to the technology trend to move forward to online education, two facultymembers in neighboring institutions are collaborating on the development of virtual and remotefunctionalities for Engineering Technology laboratories, and this poster introduces the currentprogress and following implementation strategies on the collaborative projects.",2317740903,,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Zhang, Yongpeng;Li, Lin;Chen, Xuemin",,," © 2011.

Special Issue on Computational Science and Engineering,"Leading-edge science and engineering depend on advanced computing for understanding, prediction, and control. In response to these needs, the field of computational science and engineering (CS&amp;E) is evolving rapidly, to the point that it is now widely considered to be a new discipline by itself and a third pillar of the scientific enterprise, a peer alongside theory and physical experiment. CS&amp;E is unique in that it enables progress in virtually all other disciplines by providing windows of discovery when traditional means of research reach their limits. Because of its flexibility, computer simulation has become a universal tool. A simulation may serve as a virtual microscope that lets scientists observe the world of quantum physics much smaller than an atom, or it may be employed as a virtual telescope that allows us to explore how galaxies are forming in the universe. In this way, CS&amp;E helps scientists to reach beyond our physical limitations in space and time. When physical experiments are too dangerous, too time-consuming, too expensive, or simply impossible, then advanced simulation techniques enable us to perform virtual experiments and to obtain scientific results otherwise beyond our capabilities. Just as scientists employ computer simulations to improve our understanding of the world, engineers can use them to design better products. Virtual prototypes--simulated devices and processes--can increasingly replace their real counterparts to save time and to reduce cost, while simulation-based optimization techniques help engineers to develop better products. CS&amp;E is used for research into innovative materials, to make vehicles safer and environmentally friendlier, to construct buildings that can withstand earthquakes and hurricanes, to improve energy efficiency everywhere, and to advance health care, among many other applications. To begin CS&amp;E research into a specific problem, researchers generally build a simulator that can correctly represent what has been experimentally observed. The creation of a successful simulator is often a very useful accomplishment in itself, since the work required for such a creation will typically lead to a much improved understanding of the physics (or chemistry, etc.) behind the observations. A working simulation will illuminate which effects are essential in the physics under study, which are essential for the observed behavior, and which can be neglected. In this phase, relatively simple scenarios and model geometries will often be sufficient to perform the necessary work. For example, it may be that a simple two-dimensional model will enable researchers to explore the essential mechanism under consideration. Up to this level, qualitative results are often sufficient. However, as computational modeling continues to develop, CS&amp;E research will aim to develop computational models that are sophisticated enough to be predictive. Good predictions will require quantitative accuracy, as well as the ability to address more complicated scenarios. This is often very difficult in practice. For example, methods that have been proven useful for computing the flow in rectangular driven cavities may still be very far from suitable in predicting the flow in an aneurysm in the human brain. Data structures and boundary conditions along with data input and output become much more challenging at this stage. Once CS&amp;E research has progressed to the level of being predictive, the final and ultimate step it must take to become indispensable in an engineering application is optimization. In general, an engineer wants to understand and make predictions about a device because he or she wants to improve the design; thus, he or she will want to use computing to compare different design choices and to decide how an engineering problem may be solved in the best possible way. Too often, practice in CS&amp;E is still that a human varies the parameters, and predictive simulation is used to evaluate how well design criteria have been met. CS&amp;E must enable the researcher to perform these optimization tasks seamlessly within a single model. In addition to application domain knowledge, CS&amp;E research requires expertise in advanced computing (elements of applied mathematics, scientific computing, and computer science). Additionally, many CS&amp;E tasks involve complex data analysis to provide suitable input for the computations and visualizations required to help humans interpret the simulation outcome. Thus, many CS&amp;E problems can be characterized by a pipeline that includes modeling techniques (mathematical and geometric), simulation techniques (discretizations, algorithms, data structures, software frameworks, and problem solving environments), and analysis techniques (data mining, data management, visualization, as well as error, sensitivity, stability, and uncertainty analyses). This special issue on CS&amp;E of the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing is the result of a special call for papers that was announced at the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering held in Costa Mesa, California, February 19-23, 2007. Eighty-nine papers were submitted to the special issue and subjected to a review process as rigorous as the standard review procedures of the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. Three guest editors-in-chief headed an editorial board of 22 well-known researchers in CS&amp;E. After a peer review process with two or more anonymous referees for each paper, 26 papers were eventually selected for publication and are now collected in this volume. The editors would herewith like to thank all contributors, including those whose papers do not appear in this volume. Several of these submissions may eventually appear as regular papers in SISC or other journals. As a result of our strict selectivity, we believe that this volume may be considered a milestone of case studies marking the current state of the art for research in CS&amp;E by example. As these papers clearly illustrate, CS&amp;E research does not primarily seek to achieve new results for a given domain science but rather to provide new computational tools to researchers. Even though these tools are regularly developed to address challenging problems in specific domain sciences, they are generally transferable to other applications. For example, a method to simulate large ensembles of interacting particles may be useful to an astrophysicist studying galaxy formation as well as to a nanotechnology researcher exploring molecular dynamics. If the methods were not transferable to other applications, a collection of papers of such wide span of different applications into a single volume would be of dubious value. Ultimately, CS&amp;E aims at developing a universal set of simulation methods and tools for the scientists and engineers of the future. Nevertheless, high-level CS&amp;E research differs from research in mathematics or computer science in that it is oriented at one or more realistic applications of a domain science or engineering discipline. Such problems often involve complicated three-dimensional geometries, multiple interacting scales, heterogeneities, anisotropies, and multiphysical or biological descriptions. Thus, they often thwart rigorous proofs of accuracy or efficiency, and so CS&amp;E research must regularly address validation and verification by other means than traditional mathematical analysis. Additionally, CS&amp;E research cannot be limited to any single step of the simulation pipeline. A mathematical simulation algorithm is useful in CS&amp;E only when it is also implemented on a real computer, and a new parallel processing paradigm becomes relevant for CS&amp;E only when it is demonstrated to be applicable for a large-scale numerical computation. Of course, research for an individual piece of the CS&amp;E pipeline, such as the development of a new finite element method, may also be very useful for progress in CS&amp;E, but taken by itself such a development remains merely work in numerical analysis. In other words, CS&amp;E is not just a new name for existing computational disciplines, nor--least of all--is it just mathematics in which the proofs are half finished. In fact, as opposed to other mathematical sciences, CS&amp;E often achieves its progress through a clever combination of techniques and methods employed for the different stages of the CS&amp;E pipeline. In such a case, the innovation of excellent research may consist in the creativity needed to synthesize a computational solution for a complex problem from the right building blocks. Since this is a genuine volume on CS&amp;E, it is impossible to classify the papers in it into single subtopics of CS&amp;E. Just as genuine CS&amp;E research must synthesize its solution from various building blocks, so each of these papers addresses several aspects of what we consider to be typical of CS&amp;E research. Therefore, the assignment of a paper to any single such category is necessarily somewhat arbitrary. However, all papers of this special issue share a focus on the development of innovative computational methodology in the context of challenging applications, in the spirit of our rationale above. Flow problems, when interpreted in a wide sense, form the largest class of applications that occurs in this special issue. This section includes papers on iterative solvers for flow problems, such as ""Newton-GMRES Preconditioning for Discontinuous Galerkin Discretizations of the Navier-Stokes Equations"" by Persson and Peraire and turbulence modeling in ""A Galerkin-Characteristic Method for Large-Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Flow and Heat Transfer"" by El Amrani and Seaid. The flow applications in this volume span the scales, from climate modeling in ""A New Approach to Atmospheric General Circulation Model: Global Cloud Resolving Model NICAM and Its Computational Performance"" by Tomita, Goto, and Satoh to microfluidics in ""Numerical Simulation of Particle Transport in a Drift Ratchet"" by Brenk, Bungartz, Mehl, Muntean, Neckel, and Weinzierl. Also dealing with flow problems are ""Hybrid Simulations of Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Porous Media"" by Tartakovsky, Tartakovsky, Scheibe, and Meakin and ""Output Functional Control for Nonlinear Equations Driven by Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation: The Navier-Stokes Equations"" by Micheletti and Perotto. Reflecting a current trend in computational methods research, four papers in this volume deal with biomedical applications. They include ""A Parallel Multilevel Technique for Solving the Bidomain Equation on a Human Heart with Purkinje Fibers and a Torso Model"" by Washio, Okada, and Hisada; ""Bridging Scales: A Three-Dimensional Electromechanical Finite Element Model of Skeletal Muscle"" by Roehrle, Davidson, and Pullan; ""Parallel Minimum $p$-Norm Solution of the Biomagnetic Inverse Problem for Realistic Signals Using Exact Hessian-Vector Products"" by Bücker, Buecker, and Rupp; and ""Long-Time Simulations on High Resolution Meshes to Model Calcium Waves in a Heart Cell"" by Gobbert. Adaptive methods in which the evolving solution and some aspect of the method (typically the discretization, but increasingly algorithmic parameters as well) interact so that the latter may be optimized, have been and clearly will remain a hot topic in CS&amp;E research. Papers such as ""PML Enhanced with a Self-Adaptive Goal-Oriented $hp$-Finite Element Method: Simulation of Through-Casing Borehole Resistivity Measurements"" by Pardo, Demkowicz, Torres-Verdín, and Michler; ""A Framework for the Adaptive Finite Element Solution of Large-Scale Inverse Problems"" by Bangerth; and ""Adaptive Discrete Galerkin Methods Applied to the Chemical Master Equation"" by Deuflhard, Huisinga, Jahnke, and Wulkow illustrate such adaptive techniques in complex applications. Reflecting a growth area whose techniques now have a home in a specialized SIAM journal, several papers are concerned with image processing, including ""Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Nonparametric Image Registration"" by Haber, Heldmann, and Modersitzki; ""A Variational Shape Optimization Approach for Image Segmentation with the Mumford-Shah Functional"" by Dogan, Morin, and Nochetto; and ""Brain-Tumor Interaction Biophysical Models for Medical Image Registration"" by Hogea, Davatzikos, and Biros. Two papers deal with fast transforms, including ""An Adaptive Multilevel Wavelet Solver for Elliptic Equations on an Optimal Spherical Geodesic Grid"" by Mehra and Kevlahan and ""Fast Three-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform"" by Lee, Chan, and Adjeroh. The paper by Narumi, Kameoka, Taiji, and Yasuoka presents the innovative use of multicore processors for molecular dynamics under the title ""Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations on PlayStation 3 Platform Using Virtual-GRAPE Programming Model."" The focus is on stochastic modeling and simulation methods in two papers: ""Fast Monte Carlo Simulation Methods for Biological Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Solution and on Surfaces"" by Kerr, Bartol, Kaminsky, Dittrich, Chang, Baden, Sejnowski, and Stiles; and ""Towards a Statistical Theory of Texture Evolution in Polycrystals"" by Barmak, Emelianenko, Golovaty, Kinderlehrer, and Ta'asan. Finally, a group of five papers can be counted under the topic of optimization, identification and inverse problems (though these topics of course also play a role in the imaging papers above and others). The papers here include ""Numerical Solution of an Inverse Problem of Imaging of Antipersonnel Land Mines by the Globally Convergent Convexification Algorithm"" by Xin and Klibanov; ""ORBIT: Optimization by Radial Basis Function Interpolation in Trust-Regions"" by Wild, Regis, and Shoemaker; ""Multigrid One-Shot Method for State Constrained Aerodynamic Shape Optimization"" by Hazra; ""Incremental Identification of Transport Coefficients in Convection-Diffusion Systems"" by Karalashvili, Gross, Mhamdi, Reusken, and Marquardt; and ""Model Reduction for Large-Scale Systems with High-Dimensional Parametric Input Space"" by Bui-Thanh, Willcox, and Ghattas. To conclude, the guest editors-in-chief would like to thank again all contributors, associate editors, and the anonymous referees from industry, government laboratories, and universities across the globe for the work and enthusiasm they have put into this publication project. As SIAM seeks to chart a path on the research frontier of CS&amp;E that is responsive to the interests of its members and illuminating to a vast community of developers and users not yet SIAM members, this collection helps to define CS&amp;E, to transmit exciting developments, and above all to improve and focus our collective conversation about CS&amp;E. What is the future role of CS&amp;E in SIAM publications? This special issue complements a growing book series in leading to answers!",921054207,,,Scholarly Journals,,"Johnson, Chris;Keyes, David;Ruede, Ulrich",,, [Copyright] © 2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,, PERIODICAL,,2008,1064-8275,6, English,,,, Philadelphia,2008,SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing,2008,30,https://go.openathens.net/redirector/leeds.ac.uk?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/special-issue-on-computational-science/docview/921054207/se-2?accountid=14664,,,,,, vii,,,,,,,https://leeds.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44LEE_INST/44LEE_INST:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Special+Issue+on+Computational+Science+and+Engineering&amp;author=Johnson%2C+Chris%3BKeyes%2C+David%3BRuede%2C+Ulrich&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=vii&amp;date=2008-11-01&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=SIAM+Journal+on+Scientific+Computing&amp;issn=1064-8275&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Aabiglobal_,ABI/INFORM Collection

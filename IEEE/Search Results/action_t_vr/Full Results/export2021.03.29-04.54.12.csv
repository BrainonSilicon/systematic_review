The intelligent software functions include planning/scheduling, reactive discrete control and sequencing, management of continuous control, and fault detection, diagnosis, and management of failures and errors. The CONFIG modeling and simulation tool has been used to model components and systems involved in production and transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide gas in a plant growth chamber and between that chamber and a habitation chamber with physico-chemical systems for gas processing. CONFIG is a multi-purpose discrete event simulation tool that integrates all four types of models, for use throughout the engineering and operations life cycle. Within CONFIG, continuous algebraic quantitative models are used within an abstract discrete event qualitative modeling framework of component modes and activity phases. Component modes and activity phases are embedded in transition digraphs. Flows and flow reconfigurations are efficiently analyzed during simulations. Modeled systems for the Life Support Testbed have included biological plants and crew members, oxygen concentrators and an oxygen transfer control subsystem, and injectors and flow controllers in a carbon dioxide control subsystem. To test the discrete control software, some elements of the lower level control layer and higher level planning layer of the intelligent software architecture are modeled, using CONFIG activity models. CONFIG simulations show effects of events on a system, including control action or failures, local and remote effects, and behavioral and functional effects, the time course of effects, and how effects may be detected. The CONFIG models are interfaced to the discrete control software layer and used to perform dynamic interactive testing of the software in nominal and off-nominal scenarios.","","0-7803-5489-3","10.1109/IPMM.1999.792447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=792447","","Software testing;Biological system modeling;Biological control systems;Carbon dioxide;Discrete event simulation;Software performance;Humans;Moon;Mars;Fault detection","discrete event simulation;intelligent control;program testing;biocontrol;discrete systems;fault diagnosis;chemical variables control;aerospace control","Lunar-Mars closed life support;intelligent software;hybrid modeling;biological components;human exploration;moon;planning;scheduling;reactive discrete control;sequencing;continuous control;fault detection;CONFIG modeling and simulation tool;plant growth chamber;habitation chamber;physico-chemical systems;gas processing;multi-purpose discrete event simulation tool;operations life cycle;engineering life cycle;continuous algebraic quantitative models;abstract discrete event qualitative modeling framework;component modes;activity phases;transition digraphs;flow reconfigurations;Life Support Testbed;crew members;oxygen concentrators;oxygen transfer control subsystem;flow controllers;carbon dioxide control subsystem;discrete control software;dynamic interactive testing","","","","11","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet how it induces performance gains of interlimb coordination in the bimanual movements between trained limb and the opposite, untrained limb is unclear. The present study designed a game-like interactive system for physical practice, in which an avatar’s hands could be controlled itself or by the subject during a bimanual movement task in an immersive virtual reality environment. Participants practiced with the bimanual task by simultaneously drawing non-symmetric three-sided squares (e.g., U and C) to learn limb coordination with the following training strategies: (1) performing and seeing a bimanual task (BH-BH); (2) performing a unimanual task with right hand and seeing a bimanual action (RH-BH); (3) not performing a task but seeing a bimanual action (noH-BH); (4) performing and seeing a unimanual task (RH-RH). We found that the learning performance was better after BH-BH and RH-BH compared with other training strategies. In addition, we examined the effects of virtual hand representations on the learning performance after RH-BH. We found that the performance after training was increased with the realism level of virtual hands. These findings suggest that the proposed approach of RH-BH with realistic virtual hand would result in transfer of coordination skill to the unpracticed hand, which puts forward a new approach for learning and rehabilitation of coordination skill in patients with unilateral motor deficit in immersive environments.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-5608-8","10.1109/VR46266.2020.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089455","Avatar hands;bimanual movement;coordination skill;virtual reality","Training;Task analysis;Visualization;Thumb;Shape;Virtual reality","","","","","","27","","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability to predict actions' consequences may facilitate such knowledge transfer. We consider here domains where an RL agent has access to two kinds of information: agent-centric information with constant semantics across tasks, and environment-centric information, which is necessary to solve the task, but with semantics that differ between tasks. For example, in robot navigation, environment-centric information may include the robot's geographic location, while agent-centric information may include sensor readings of various nearby obstacles. We propose that these situations provide an opportunity for a very natural style of knowledge transfer, in which the agent learns to predict actions' environmental consequences using agent-centric information. These predictions contain important information about the affordances and dangers present in a novel environment, and can effectively transfer knowledge from agent-centric to environment-centric learning systems.

MVs are encoded in video stream and can be extracted directly without extra calculation. However, directly training CNN with MVs degrades accuracy severely due to the noise and the lack of fine details in MVs. In order to relieve this problem, we propose four training strategies which leverage the knowledge learned from OF CNN to enhance the accuracy of MV CNN. Our insight is that MV and OF share inherent similar structures which allow us to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. To fully utilize the knowledge learned in OF domain, we develop deeply transferred MV CNN. Experimental results on various datasets show the effectiveness of our training strategies.

However, a robot was given a priori knowledge about which pair of sensory information and action should be associated. This paper addresses the development of social actions without such knowledge with a learning mechanism that iteratively acquires social actions by finding and reproducing the contingency inherent in the interaction with a caregiver. The measurement of contingency based on transfer entropy is used to find appropriate pairs of variables for acquiring social actions from possible candidates. The reproduction of found contingency promotes a change of contingent structure in the subsequent actions of a caregiver and a robot. In computer simulations of human-robot interaction, we examine what kinds of actions related to joint attention can be acquired in which order by controlling the behavior of caregiver agents. The result shows that a robot acquires joint attention related actions in an order that resembles an infantpsilas development of joint attention.","2161-9476","978-1-4244-2661-4","10.1109/DEVLRN.2008.4640839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4640839","joint attention;transfer entropy;contingent chain;sequential acquisition of social behavior","Robots;Robot sensing systems;Joints;Face;Detectors;Reliability;Pediatrics","artificial intelligence;biocommunications;biocybernetics;information theory;learning systems;robots","joint attention related action development;interaction contingency reproduction;gaze following;gaze alternation;communication;learning methods;learning mechanism;social action acquisition;interaction contingency search;contingency measurement;transfer entropy;contingent structure change;human-robot interaction","","7","","11","","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For an underwater vehicle, its own vibration and sound radiation usually needs to be known accurately. Therefore, accurate prediction of sound radiation from submerged structures is of great significance. As we know, the generation of radiated sound by a submerged structure is a very complicated process. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict radiated noise by monitoring submerged structure vibration. Traditionally, BEM methodology is suitable for solving the problem of the acoustic field calculation by known structure vibration. However, the required number of measuring vibration points is very large; and, vibration phase information needs to be measured accurately - but we know that these requirements are difficult to be satisfied in practice. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of sound radiation prediction of submerged structures by using a transfer method. As we know, under the action of an excitation force sound radiation of a submerged structure is generally a linear system, so the radiation field is proportional to the structure vibration. For an experimental structure model, the structural vibration and the sound radiation field can be calculated by theoretical modeling, and their transfer relationship can be derived easily. Then the sound radiation field can be predicted according to the structure vibration data obtained by experiment. In this paper, the structure vibration is described by the mean square velocity, and sound radiated power is concerned with sound radiated field. For the underwater cylindrical shell model, the simulation calculation is carried out with LMS Virtual Lab software; and, the transfer relationship between the structure mean square velocity and sound radiated power is investigated for different force excitation cases. Then, a measuring experiment is carried out for a cylindrical shell model. By measuring vibration acceleration of the cylindrical shell, the sound radiated power of the model is predicted by a transfer method. The predicted result has a good agreement with the directly measured sound radiated power. The experiment result shows that this paper's prediction method is feasible.

Current techniques rely on long distances of propagation to increase the amount of temporal dispersion in the compound signals and reduce the relative effect of errors in the forward model. The method described in this paper attempts to reduce errors in DCV estimation through transfer function normalization and, thereby, eliminate the need for long segments of nerve. Compound action potential (CAP) signals are recorded from several, equally spaced electrodes in an array spanning only a 10-cm length of nerve. Relative nerve-to-electrode transfer functions (NETFs) between the nerve and each of the array electrodes are estimated by comparing discrete Fourier transforms of the array signals. NETFs are normalized along the array so that waveform differences can be attributed to the effects of temporal dispersion between recordings, and more accurate DCV estimates can be calculated from the short nerve segment. The method is tested using simulated and real CAP data. DCV estimates are improved for simulated signals. The normalization procedure results in DCVs that qualitatively match those from the literature when used on actual CAP recordings.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.784142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=784142","","Bioelectric phenomena;Electrodes;Electric potential;Diseases;Dispersion;Transfer functions;Inverse problems;Shape measurement;Pharmaceutical technology;Pathology","neurophysiology;bioelectric potentials;transfer functions;discrete Fourier transforms;medical signal processing;biomedical electrodes;array signal processing","conduction velocity distribution estimation;short segment of nerve;noninvasive determination;peripheral nerve;temporal dispersion;compound signals;reduced errors;transfer function normalization;action potential signals;equally spaced electrodes;relative nerve-to-electrode transfer functions;discrete Fourier transforms;array signals;waveform differences;normalization procedure;electroneurography;inverse problem;forward problem;10 cm","Action Potentials;Adult;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electrodes;Humans;Male;Median Nerve;Models, Neurological;Neural Conduction;Peripheral Nerves;Reaction Time;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","13","","25","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Temperature field distribution of fracture rock is described by using heat-transfer differential equation. At the same time, the heat-transfer equation is discretized by using weighted residual Galerkin finite element. Combined with boundary condition and parameters, the numerical solution is obtained. The results of numerical simulation show that the heat transportation resulted from fracture flow has major impact on the temperature field distribution of fracture rock. Under the action of fracture flow, the difference in temperature of water and rock wall is gradually reduced. Heat-transfer is increasing as the increase of the velocity of seepage, and the time of reached thermal equilibrium is cut down. The rate of temperature isoline is decreased along the fracture flow. The fluid-solid coupling had evident effects on temperature field distribution of fracture rock, and fluid temperature may influence temperature gradients. The contrast of flow velocity and fluid temperature shows that the effect of the former to temperature field distribution is bigger.","","978-0-7695-5016-9","10.1109/ICDMA.2013.202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6598124","fracture mass;water - rock heat transfer;steady temperature field;numerical simulation","Rocks;Heat transfer;Mathematical model;Temperature distribution;Water heating;Equations","heat transfer;rocks","heat-transfer numerical simulation;fracture rock seepage;fluid-solid coupling;fracture rock heat-transfer;heat-transfer coupling model;temperature field distribution;residual Galerkin finite element;temperature isoline rate","","","","9","","16 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, it plays an essential role in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Since an RL agent needs to constantly interact with its surroundings, the deep Q network (DQN) is inevitably faced with the need to learn numerous network parameters, which results in low learning efficiency. In this paper, a multisource transfer double DQN (MTDDQN) based on actor learning is proposed. The transfer learning technique is integrated with deep RL to make the RL agent collect, summarize, and transfer action knowledge, including policy mimic and feature regression, to the training of related tasks. There exists action overestimation in DQN, i.e., the lower probability limit of action corresponding to the maximum Q value is nonzero. Therefore, the transfer network is trained by using double DQN to eliminate the error accumulation caused by action overestimation. In addition, to avoid negative transfer, i.e., to ensure strong correlations between source and target tasks, a multisource transfer learning mechanism is applied. The Atari2600 game is tested on the arcade learning environment platform to evaluate the feasibility and performance of MTDDQN by comparing it with some mainstream approaches, such as DQN and double DQN. Experiments prove that MTDDQN achieves not only human-like actor learning transfer capability, but also the desired learning efficiency and testing accuracy on target task.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2806087","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8310951","Actor learning;Atari2600 game;double deep Q network (DQN);multisource transfer","Task analysis;Games;Training;Learning systems;Neural networks;Optimization;Estimation","computer games;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;psychology;regression analysis","multisource transfer double DQN;actor learning;deep reinforcement learning;deep learning;artificial intelligence;machine learning;RL agent;deep Q network;numerous network parameters;low learning efficiency;MTDDQN;transfer learning technique;deep RL;action knowledge;feature regression;action overestimation;transfer network;negative transfer;multisource transfer learning mechanism;arcade learning environment platform;transfer capability;testing accuracy;feature expression;learning efficiency;Atari2600 game","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Humans;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Reinforcement, Psychology;Transfer, Psychology","8","","40","","9 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has not been clear yet if SR can play an important role in information processing in neural networks. In this paper, we test the hypothesis through computer simulations that SR can induce an oscillation phenomenon in a recurrent neural network with added Gaussian noise in which the recurrent model is constructed by four Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron models. Each HH neuron model is driven by Gaussian noise and sub-threshold excitatory synaptic currents with an alpha function from another HH neuron model, and the action potentials (spike firings) of each HH neuron model are transferred to the other HH neuron model via sub-threshold synaptic currents. From spike firing times recorded, the inter spike interval (ISI) histogram was generated, and the periodicity of spike firings was detected from the ISI histogram at each HH neuron model. The results show that the probability of spike firings in the oscillation period (about 50 ms or 20 Hz) increases as the standard deviation (S.D.) of the Gaussian white noise increases, and reach a maximum value at a specific S.D. of the Gaussian white noise, implying that SR can improve sub-threshold synaptic transmission in the recurrent HH neuron model. It is concluded that an oscillation (20 Hz) can be induced by adding Gaussian white noise at lower amplitudes with intrinsic characteristics in the recurrent HH neuron model, while another oscillation (100 Hz) can be generated by the noise at greater amplitudes with extrinsic characteristics.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4649697","Sub-threshold Synaptic Transmission;Action Potential;Stochastic Resonance;Hodgkin-Huxley model;Inter-Spike Intervals;Computer Simulation","Neurons;Oscillators;White noise;Computational modeling;Histograms;Biological system modeling;Membrane potentials","","","Action Potentials;Computer Simulation;Humans;Membrane Potentials;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical;Neural Networks (Computer);Neurons;Normal Distribution;Oscillometry;Probability;Stochastic Processes;Synaptic Transmission;Time Factors","2","","9","","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper is going to review research literature exploring behavioral fidelity and reality benchmarking in interactive VEs focusing on results from two studies aiming to simulate perceptual processes. Study 1 investigates spatial awareness based on merging episodic information with spatial preconceptions and Study 2 looks at subjective impressions of illumination.","1062-922X","0-7803-8566-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2004.1400752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1400752","","Virtual environment;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Computer simulation;Physics;Rendering (computer graphics);Computer graphics;Computational geometry;Optical propagation;Humans","virtual reality;computer vision;large-scale systems;visual perception;human factors;digital simulation","interactive virtual environments;perception simulation;computer graphics algorithms;geometry simulation;light propagation simulation;photorealistic images;virtual environment simulator technologies;complex system;episodic information;spatial preconceptions;behavioral fidelity;reality benchmarking","","1","","29","","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A conventional and widely used technique for simultaneous identification of the neuromuscular and visual systems makes use of cross-spectral density estimates. This paper shows that this technique requires a specific noninterference hypothesis, often implicitly assumed, that may be difficult to meet during actual experimental designs. A mathematical justification of the necessity of the noninterference hypothesis is given. Furthermore, two methods are proposed that do not have the same limitations. The first method is based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs, whereas the second one combines cross-spectral estimators with interpolation in the frequency domain. The two identification methods are validated by offline simulations and contrasted to the classic method. The results reveal that the classic method fails when the noninterference hypothesis is not fulfilled; on the contrary, the two proposed techniques give reliable estimates. Finally, the three identification methods are applied to experimental data from a closed-loop control task with pilots. The two proposed techniques give comparable estimates, different from those obtained by the classic method. The differences match those found with the simulations. Thus, the two identification methods provide a good alternative to the classic method and make it possible to simultaneously estimate human's neuromuscular and visual responses in cases where the classic method fails.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2384525","myCopter Project; European Commission under the Seventh Framework Program; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045541","Haptic feedback;neuromuscular system;pilot identification;tracking task;Haptic feedback;neuromuscular system;pilot identification;tracking task","Visualization;Haptic interfaces;Neuromuscular;Force;Transfer functions;Admittance;Frequency measurement","aerospace control;autoregressive processes;closed loop systems;feedback;frequency-domain analysis;haptic interfaces;interpolation","multiloop identification;visual pilot response estimation;neuromuscular pilot response estimation;multiloop pilot model;neuromuscular system;visual system;cross-spectral density estimate;noninterference hypothesis;autoregressive model;exogenous input;frequency domain interpolation;offline simulation;closed-loop control task;human neuromuscular response;haptic feedback","Aircraft;Computer Simulation;Cybernetics;Feedback, Sensory;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Task Performance and Analysis;Touch","7","","39","","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The addition of the SCS to the network required a remedial action scheme (RAS) integrated in the HVDC (high-voltage direct-current) control in order to meet AC systems reliability criteria. One of the basic components of the RAS is the frequency-dependent power modulation combined with an effective voltage control in the western network. Computer simulations were performed to check design and to provide initial settings for the RAS. As one part of the commissioning of the SCS, field tests of the RAS were conducted.

A fine-grained relaxation algorithm (FGRA) is proposed for a more efficient solution of the nonlinear differential algebraic equations of the integrated system model, including the detailed nonlinear models of the synchronous generators in the AC system which can be solved in parallel without matrix on the FPGA. The system solution is massively parallelized and pipelined in hardware to realize the lowest latencies and minimum utilization of hardware resource. Two case studies are used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and demonstrated a closed-loop prediction scenario for improving grid stability. Computational acceleration of up to 134 times faster than real-time are reported for the two case studies, and the accuracy of the dynamic interaction is validated using the off-line transient stability simulation tool TSAT of the DSAToolsTM package.","1944-9933","978-1-7281-5508-1","10.1109/PESGM41954.2020.9282079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282079","","Heuristic algorithms;Power system stability;Hardware;Stability analysis;Real-time systems;Mathematical model;Field programmable gate arrays","closed loop systems;control engineering computing;differential algebraic equations;field programmable gate arrays;power engineering computing;power grids;power system simulation;power system transient stability","available transfer capacities;grid congestion;integrated grid system stability;faster-than-real-time dynamic simulation;reconfigurable parallel hardware architecture;field programmable gate array;FPGA;fine-grained relaxation algorithm;nonlinear differential algebraic equations;integrated system model;nonlinear models;hardware resource;off-line transient stability simulation tool;reconfigurable hardware;energy control centers;grid system reliability;TSAT;FTRT dynamic simulation;integrated AC-DC grids;FGRA;closed-loop prediction","","","","0","","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subjective factors are those that depend on the actions of maintenance personnel, taking into account gross violations of instructions and regulations governing the basic requirements for design, installation and current maintenance of ALSC devices. To achieve a significant reduction in the impact of such factors can be development of a set organizational and technical measures: continuous technical training of staff; providing staff with the necessary instrumentation and spare parts; aligning the volume of work performed by the number of staff and other activities. To the objective factors are caused by design features and technical parameters of the system ALSC (primary parameters of equipment and rail line, the allowable currents asymmetry of train speed), external influences (temperature changes, humidity, mechanical impact, electric traction current, the intersection of railroad with power lines, lightning, etc.).

This risk is due to deficits in posterior chain and hip recruitment associated with aberrant frontal knee loads. The identification of these risk factors has led to targeted neuromuscular training (NMT) interventions to enhance hip neuromuscular control during such tasks. Despite the successful modification of ACL injury risk factors following NMT, the transfer of these corrected movement patterns to the sport-specific contexts has not been directly evaluated. Sport-specific virtual reality (VR) may provide the best method to measure training transfer to realistic sport performance, while still allowing appropriate experimental control and high-fidelity performance measurements. The current study examined the effect of a biofeedback-driven augmented NMT (aNMT) on skill transfer of ACL-injury resistant movement patterns during performance of sport-specific VR scenarios. Five trained athletes participated, and their performance on an unanticipated cutting task was assessed in VR prior to and after six weeks of aNMT. A significant 87% reduction in internal hip rotation was observed on the plant leg during the loading phase of cutting (p = .05), along with an observed 116% reduction during the push-off phase (p = .02), from pre- to post-training. A non-significant trend of a 19% reduction in knee abduction was also observed (p = .15). This study is the first that has utilized free ambulatory wireless VR to assess injury risk in athletes during performance of sport-specific tasks. The reduction in internal hip rotation and knee abduction align with previous findings on laboratory based tests. The current results are the first step in the validation of sport-specific VR as a tool for understanding injury risk during simulation of real-world sport performance.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007511","anterior cruciate ligament;virtual reality;sport;cutting;soccer","Injuries;Hip;Training;Neuromuscular;Biomechanics;Knee;Virtual reality","biomechanics;injuries;medical computing;muscle;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;sport;virtual reality","sport-specific virtual reality;anterior cruciate ligament injury risk;unanticipated cutting;female athletes;posterior chain;hip recruitment;aberrant frontal knee loads;neuromuscular training;biofeedback-driven augmented NMT;hip neuromuscular control;corrected movement patterns;sport-specific contexts;realistic sport performance;ACL-injury resistant movement patterns;push-off phase;free ambulatory wireless VR;internal hip rotation;knee abduction","","1","","62","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To facilitate comparative evaluation independently of person detection, the standard evaluation protocol for action recognition uses an oracle person detector to obtain perfect bounding box information at both training and test time. The assumption is that, in practice, a general person detector will provide candidate bounding boxes for action recognition. In this paper, we argue that this paradigm is suboptimal and that action class labels should already be considered during the detection stage. Motivated by the observation that body pose is strongly conditioned on action class, we show that: 1) the existing state-of-the-art generic person detectors are not adequate for proposing candidate bounding boxes for action classification; 2) due to limited training examples, the direct training of action-specific person detectors is also inadequate; and 3) using only a small number of labeled action examples, the transfer learning is able to adapt an existing detector to propose higher quality bounding boxes for subsequent action classification. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate transfer learning for the task of action-specific person detection in still images. We perform extensive experiments on two benchmark data sets: 1) Stanford-40 and 2) PASCAL VOC 2012. For the action detection task (i.e., both person localization and classification of the action performed), our approach outperforms methods based on general person detection by 5.7% mean average precision (MAP) on Stanford-40 and 2.1% MAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Our approach also significantly outperforms the state of the art with a MAP of 45.4% on Stanford-40 and 31.4% on PASCAL VOC 2012. We also evaluate our action detection approach for the task of action classification (i.e., recognizing actions without localizing them).

To address this, transfer learning can be used to train the policy first in a simulated environment and then transfer it to physical agent. As the simulation never matches reality perfectly, the physics, visuals and action spaces by necessity differ between these environments to some degree. In this work, we study how general video games can be directly used instead of fine-tuned simulations for the sim-to-real transfer. Especially, we study how the agent can learn the new action space autonomously, when the game actions do not match the robot actions. Our results show that the different action space can be learned by re-training only part of neural network and we obtain above 90% mean success rate in simulation and robot experiments.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-6631-5","10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9053221","deep reinforcement learning;transfer learning;sim-to-real;reality gap;action space transfer","Training;Visualization;Neural networks;Transfer learning;Games;Task analysis;Robots","computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;robots","video game;deep reinforcement learning;simulated environment;real-world domain;transfer learning;physical agent;general video games;fine-tuned simulations;game actions;robot actions;action space;mean success rate;robot experiments;learning tasks;visuals spaces;physics spaces;neural network","","","","19","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the original model presents a tradeoff between violating the Nyquist criterion on one hand and using a discretization frequency that is unnecessarily high with respect to the bandwidth of the generated AP on the other. Here, we present an improved line source model that, compared to the original, allows a lower discretization frequency while retaining the accuracy by simply introducing a continuous-time anti-aliasing filter. Moreover, a transfer function form of the transmembrane current is presented that promote the use of sophisticated signal processing methods on these type of signals. Both continuous-time and discrete-time models are presented. We also address and analyze the implications of the finite length of the muscle fibers. Including this in the model is straightforward, owing to the convolutional form of the line source model, and is manifested by a simple transformation of the associated weighting function. AP modeling is discussed for the three different electrode models: the concentric needle electrode, the single fiber electrode, and the macro electrode. The presented model is suitable for modeling large motor units, where both accuracy and computational efficiency are important factors. To simplify the selection of the discretization interval, we derive what we call the cumulative cutoff frequency that provides an estimate of the required Nyquist frequency.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.834292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344191","","Muscles;Electrodes;Signal processing;Cutoff frequency;Frequency estimation;Signal analysis;Bandwidth;Filters;Transfer functions;Convolution","electromyography;physiological models;medical signal processing;Nyquist criterion;filtering theory;transfer functions;biomembranes;biomedical electrodes","fast muscle action potential simulations;line source model;signal processing;Nyquist criterion;discretization frequency;continuous-time antialiasing filter;transfer function;transmembrane current;continuous-time model;discrete-time model;weighting function;electrode models;concentric needle electrode;single fiber electrode;macroelectrode;cumulative cutoff frequency;electromyography","Action Potentials;Animals;Computer Simulation;Electromyography;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Neurons;Muscle Fibers;Neural Conduction","6","","31","","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper analyzes the circuits' topology of VSC-HVDC transmission line under internal and external faults, and then defines the transfer impedance of fault component circuits. With considering the frequency-dependent parameters of cables, it is found that the impedance of high frequency under external faults is quite larger than that under internal faults, which means that the high-frequency current can be used to distinguish internal and external faults.

Since visual observations are defined as raw images or high-dimensional image features, the learning process of such policies tends to require a huge amount of training data. Therefore, their applications are often limited in simulations and difficult in the real world due to the high sampling cost of the training data. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a policy transfer learning framework with feature extraction and reinforcement learning. We utilize transfer component analysis as a feature extraction method for identifying common features across the two domains. Our framework first extracts the common features in both the simulations and the real environments. Then a control policy with the extracted features as observations is learned by reinforcement learning in simulations and subsequently transferred to the real world even with appearance errors. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted simulations and experiments with an actual robot platform.","2161-8089","978-1-5386-3593-3","10.1109/COASE.2018.8560543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560543","","","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection","transfer component analysis;control policy;raw images;high-dimensional image features;training data;feature extraction method;visual observations;reinforcement learning process;policy transfer learning framework;robot platform","","1","","15","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, unsecured CRN can easily be manipulated in order to attack legacy users on the communication channel. As a result, the network’s performance significantly degrades. Therefore, communication channel security is an important issue that needs to be addressed in a CRN. In this work, we focus on improving the security of multi-channel communication in a CRN, while various jammers try to access channels of interest to prevent SUs from using them. By using game-theoretic concepts and by defining states, actions, and players’ rewards, we propose game–based schemes that find the best channel for the secondary users (SUs) in order to avoid jammer’s attacks on communication channels. Accordingly, the problem is finding the optimal channel to maximize the long-term reward of the SU where communication channels are not used by the primary users (PUs) and are not jammed by attackers. In addition, the idea of transfer learning might be applied to the problem under consideration, and thus, a transfer Game-Actor-Critic (TGACT) scheme is proposed, which uses the transferred knowledge in a double-game period to accelerate the learning process and provide performance improvement in channel selection. Finally, the performance of the proposed schemes is simulated with different configurations. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes are quite resistant to jammer attacks, and achieve better performance compared to other channel selection schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068129","the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korean Government Ministry of Science and ICT MSIT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9383211","Actor–critic;cognitive radio networks;game theory;jammer;reinforcement learning;transfer learning","Jamming;Games;Transfer learning;Security;Communication channels;Sensors;Task analysis","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","23 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In brief, an amplifier system does a continuous analog computation of the current that would be flowing between the two cells if there had been an intercellular coupling conductance G/sub c/, and then provides current inputs to the cells accordingly. Building on this concept, we developed the computer-controlled ""model clamp"" technique, in which an isolated cardiac cell is dynamically coupled in real time to a comprehensive mathematical cell model (e.g., the phase-2 Luo-Rudy model). With this system we have the ability to vary coupling conductance, effective size of both model cell and real cell, and intrinsic cellular properties of the model cell. In courses on cardiac electrophysiology, the model clamp system provides a useful computer tool to probe action potential transfer between cardiac cells.

By referring to the empirical rules of previous work, the distribution system restoration procedure can be divided into three stages: group restoration, zone restoration and load transfer. The unique feature of the proposed expert system is that the variation of load currents is considered. By doing so, the restoration strategies can be more accurate, practical and effective. A simulation on a small distribution system is performed, the results are compared with the same system which has constant load currents.","","0-7803-7525-4","10.1109/TDC.2002.1177643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177643","","Expert systems;Switches;Automation;Knowledge based systems;Conductors;Transformers;Object oriented modeling;Genetic algorithms;Fuzzy logic;Load management","power distribution control;power system restoration;switching;object-oriented methods;expert systems;load (electric)","object-oriented expert system;multi-period load transfer;distribution automation;restoration process;switching actions;sectionalizing switches;tie switches;logical reasoning;mathematical process;CLIPS;distribution system restoration procedure;group restoration;zone restoration;load transfer;load currents variation;simulation;constant load currents","","4","","8","","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the Dimitrov-Dimitrova (D-D) convolutional model, the first temporal derivative of the intracellular action potential (IAP) is used as the source. In this model, the ratio between the amplitudes of the second and first phases of the SFAP (which we call the PPR, after peak-to-peak ratio) increases invariably with radial distance. This is not the case of real recorded fibrillation potentials (FPs). Moreover, FPs show a wider PPR range than that which the D-D model can provide. These discrepancies suggest that the D-D model should be revised. Since the volume conduction parameters seem to have no apparent effects on the PPR, we assume that the origin of this difference lies in the excitation source. This paper presents a new analytical description of the IAP based on that expressed in the D-D model. The new approximation is shown to model FPs with a range of PPRs comparable to that observed in a set of real FPs which we used as our test signals.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.870257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608507","Fibrillation potential;intracellular action potential;peak-to-peak-ratio;SFAP model","Muscles;Bioelectric phenomena;Electric potential;Convolution;Optical fiber testing;Transfer functions;Shape;Electrodes;Pathology","muscle;cellular biophysics;bioelectric potentials;physiological models;convolution","fibrillation potential modeling;muscle intracellular action potential;single-fiber action potential;bioelectrical source;transfer function;convolution;electrical volume conduction;Dimitrov-Dimitrova convolutional model","Action Potentials;Adult;Aged;Computer Simulation;Denervation;Female;Humans;Intracellular Space;Male;Models, Neurological;Muscle Fibers;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle, Skeletal;Neural Conduction","16","","23","","20 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This interaction of real-time distributed simulations could greatly enhance education and training, operational verification of design, and mission rehearsal functions needed to support the defense and commercial industries. Through the advancements in technologies (i.e. visual systems, host processors, databases, and networks), we can now realize the expectations of this virtual world. This paper addresses the network requirements for a federal government initiative called Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). Through our discussion of the DIS environment, we will identify the services and performance capabilities required of advanced network architectures, and relate these requirements to the proposed capabilities of the standard-based broadband technologies of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and synchronous optical network (SONET). We map the DIS network requirements to the capabilities inherent to these broadband technologies, and specify the access of those capabilities from the DIS application through the broadband network and services.<>","","0-7803-1825-0","10.1109/ICC.1994.369004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=369004","","Broadband communication;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Protocols;Distributed computing;Application software;Industrial training;Visual databases;Asynchronous transfer mode;Space technology","B-ISDN;asynchronous transfer mode;SONET;digital simulation;telecommunication computing;interactive systems","distributed interactive simulation;broadband networks;broadband services;real-time distributed simulations;federal government initiative;performance;network architectures;asynchronous transfer mode;synchronous optical network;ATM;SONET;B-ISDN","","","","2","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The GA was coupled to NEURON using a model of extracellular stimulation of a mammalian myelinated axon. Stimulation waveforms represented the organisms of a population, and each waveform's shape was encoded into genes. The fitness of each waveform was based on its energy efficiency and ability to elicit an action potential. After each generation of the GA, waveforms mated to produce offspring waveforms, and a new population was formed consisting of the offspring and the fittest waveforms of the previous generation. Over the course of the GA, waveforms became increasingly energy-efficient and converged upon a highly energy-efficient shape. The resulting waveforms resembled truncated normal curves or sinusoids and were 3-74% more energy-efficient than several waveform shapes commonly used in neural stimulation. If implemented in implantable neural stimulators, the GA optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgery.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333722","","Genetic algorithms;Energy efficiency;Shape;Energy consumption;Biological information theory;Evolution (biology);Neurons;Biological system modeling;Extracellular;Nerve fibers","genetic algorithms;neurophysiology;prosthetics;secondary cells","genetic algorithm;energy efficient waveforms;neural stimulation;energy consumption;battery powered implantable stimulators;biological evolution;NEURON;mammalian myelinated axon;energy efficiency","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation;Energy Transfer;Models, Neurological;Nerve Fibers, Myelinated","4","","9","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This direct interaction paradigm enables an intuitive method to apply actions by associating iconic representation of objects to each other. Since dragging of these iconic representations is the most time-consuming subtask of the dragand- drop metaphor, many extensions of this approach have been proposed to enhance this process. However, a transfer of these concepts to virtual reality (VR) systems has not been realized. In this paper we propose the grab-and-throw metaphor which is a VR-based analogon to the drag-and-drop metaphor. The proposed concepts enable users to select a virtual object by grabbing it and to throw the object within a virtual environment (VE) in the direction of another object. As soon as the object hits another object, an associated action is performed. The trajectory of the thrown object is based on physical motions adapted from the real-world. In order to ease hitting a desired target object, snapping strategies are used such that the aimed object attracts the thrown object. We give a technical description of the grab-and-throw metaphor and discuss example application scenarios which benefit from the usage of the described metaphor.","","1-4244-0225-5","10.1109/VR.2006.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1647512","","Virtual reality;Large screen displays;Control systems;User interfaces;Visualization;Virtual environment;Acceleration;Space exploration;Taxonomy;Navigation","","","","1","","11","","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An architecture based upon the client/server paradigm that optimally utilizes the mass storage capabilities of large servers, the data transport speed of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and multiprocessor workstations has many attractive features. However, before such a system can become operational, issues relating to throughput need to be addressed. These issues include network connection speed, ATM switch size, server throughput and workstation processing capability. The total number of workstations that can be supported with a particular configuration is ultimately determined by the average response time required to perform typical operations. This paper details the use of a discrete event simulator to model an image archiving and retrieval system. Simulation modeling places few restrictions on the fidelity with which network elements can be represented. In addition, the actions of an analyst, as he/she goes through typical operations, making demands upon the system resources, can be realistically portrayed. The stochastic nature of demands for network resources is modeled using random number generators. The execution of a simulation model is similar to running an in vitro experiment on a candidate system.

To investigate their neural implementation, mice were trained to do an auditory virtual navigation task and neuronal activity was recorded in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the posteromedial cortex (PM), with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f after gene transfer by AAV2/1 and 2-photon microscopy. A mouse was head restrained and maneuvered a spherical treadmill. 12 speakers around the treadmill provided an auditory virtual environment. The direction and amplitude of sound pulses emulated the location of the sound source, which was moved according to the mouse's locomotion on the treadmill. When the mouse reached the sound source and licked a spout, it got a water reward. The task consisted of two conditions: continuous condition in which the guiding sound was presented continuously and intermittent condition in which the sound was presented intermittently. In both conditions, mice increased lickings as they approached the sound source, indicating that mice recognized the sound-source position and predicted a reward. In intermittent condition, the anticipatory licking was increased even when the sound was omitted, suggesting that mice maintained the predicted sound-source position based on their own actions. We optically recorded calcium transients of up to 500 neurons simultaneously in each of layers 2, 3 and 5 in 8 mice. A subset of neurons increased the activities as mice approached the goal. This increase of activities was observed both with and without sound inputs in all the layers of PPC, while the increase was observed only during sound inputs in PM. To test how the activities in PPC and PM contributed to the prediction of goal distance, we conducted a decoding analysis. Probabilistic decoder predicted the goal distance from the recorded population activities: the decoder was trained with the data in continuous condition. In PPC, the predicted distance significantly decreased both with and without sound inputs consistently with the actual distance to the goal. These results suggest that PPC realizes action-dependent state prediction in the absence of sensory input.","","978-1-4799-8562-3","10.1109/ICIIBMS.2015.7439529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439529","neuroscience;two-photon microscopy;posterior parietal cortex;decoder","Mice;Decoding;Calcium;Microscopy;Neurons;Bioinformatics;Biomedical imaging","brain models;decision making;neurophysiology;probability","action-dependent state prediction;mouse posterior parietal cortex;model-based decision making;action-dependent state transition models;neural implementation;auditory virtual navigation task;neuronal activity;posteromedial cortex;genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f;gene transfer;AAV2/1;2-photon microscopy;spherical treadmill;auditory virtual environment;sound pulses;sound source;mouse locomotion;sound-source position;intermittent condition;anticipatory licking;optically recorded calcium transients;decoding analysis;probabilistic decoder;continuous condition","","","","","","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their physical layouts are designed to ensure accurate prediction of both the resonant frequency and the resulting frequency-variable behavior of the two-port arrangement. This network is then used in a passive sensing system, based on a smart exploitation of the dc-power dc-load relationship of a standard RF identification (RFID) rectifier, to convert the data of a remote sensor, representing the system variable load. The reflected power variations at the transmitter side, due to the dc load variations, are successfully used to perform the sensor readout.

Through examining solutions to different tasks, it can uncover behavioral invariances in the domain, by identifying actions to be prioritized in local contexts, invariant to task details. This information has the effect of greatly increasing the speed of solving new problems. We formalise this notion as action priors, defined as distributions over the action space, conditioned on environment state, and show how these can be learnt from a set of value functions. We apply action priors in the setting of reinforcement learning, to bias action selection during exploration. Aggressive use of action priors performs context based pruning of the available actions, thus reducing the complexity of lookahead during search. We additionally define action priors over observation features, rather than states, which provides further flexibility and generalizability, with the additional benefit of enabling feature selection. Action priors are demonstrated in experiments in a simulated factory environment and a large random graph domain, and show significant speed ups in learning new tasks. Furthermore, we argue that this mechanism is cognitively plausible, and is compatible with findings from cognitive psychology.","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2015.2419715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079487","Action ordering;action selection;reinforcement learning;search pruning;transfer learning","Learning (artificial intelligence);Context;Robots;Equations;Training;Decision making;Buildings","decision making;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence)","action priors;domain invariance learning;decision making problems;behavioral invariances;reinforcement learning;action selection;context based pruning;lookahead complexity;feature selection;cognitive psychology","","1","","34","","3 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the state and action domains of the problem are immense, the learning rate of the agent decreases dramatically and eventually the agent loses the ability to learn. In order to eliminate the effects of the curse of the dimensionality, researchers typically concentrate on the methods that reduce the complexity of the problems. While some of them model the problem in a hierarchical manner, the others try to transfer the knowledge obtained during the learning process of simpler tasks. While learning from scratch ignores the previous experiences, transferring full knowledge may mislead the agent because of the conflicting requirements. The main goal of this study is to improve the learning rate of the agent by transferring the relevant parts of the knowledge acquired as a result of previous experiences. The main contribution of this study is to merge these two approaches to transfer only the relevant knowledge in a setting.

The additional action of the Oersted field not only changes the mode pattern but also shifts the eigenfrequency from 8.24 GHz to 2.99 GHz due to the degradation of symmetry. For the non-collinear case, without taking into account the Oersted field, a tilted polarizer leads to the excitation of the quasi-uniform mode and reduces the switching time substantially.

In particular, the synthesis of input-output regulators, which uses the method of modal control based on solving polynomial equations, necessitates the use of prefilters, which are as sophisticated as the whole regulator. This article is concerned with developing an approach that focuses on simplifying these control devices without impacting the performance indicators of the system in general. For regulator synthesis, we used the method of polynomial equations ensuring the set quality of ACS processes on the basis of measuring only the output coordinate of the controlled facility. Regulator simplification is based on the method of equivalent structure transformation, ensuring the permanence of ACS transfer function, while astatism of the control action is achieved by using the method of coefficient error. The proposed method of control device simplification is based on the implementation of the method of equivalent structural transformations, permitting a significant reduction in the complexity of control devices. This method differs from existing ones in dispensing with the need to recalculate control device coefficients and in retaining the performance indicators of an automatic control system. Using the proposed method enables us to halve the order of control device transfer function, which significantly reduces the labour intensity of its practical realization. In addition, control program execution time decreases, which is important when modern automatic control systems are created by facilities with high processing speed and demanding short control program execution times. The results of mathematical simulation analysis have confirmed identical performance indicators for both simplified and initial automatic control systems during the processing of control and disturbance actions.","","978-1-5386-4307-5","10.1109/ICIEAM.2018.8728822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8728822","polynomial regulator;synthesis;equivalent structural transformations;simplification","Regulators;Mathematical model;Transfer functions;Transient analysis;Industrial engineering;Manufacturing;Process control","control system analysis;control system synthesis;mathematical analysis;polynomials;process control;transfer functions","polynomial equations;regulator synthesis;ACS processes;ACS transfer function;control device simplification;equivalent structural transformations;control device coefficients;automatic control system;control device transfer function;control unit simplification;control program execution time;mathematical simulation analysis","","","","26","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The available pulse shapes are typically determined by the relatively limited capabilities of commercial stimulation devices instead of efficiency or optimality. Furthermore, magnetic stimulation is relatively inefficient with respect to the required energy compared to other neurostimulation techniques. We therefore analyze and optimize the waveform dynamics with a nonlinear model of a mammalian motor axon for the first time, without any pre-definition of waveform candidates. We implemented an unbiased and stable numerical algorithm using variational calculus in combination with a global optimization method. This approach yields very stable results with comprehensible characteristic properties, such as a first phase which reduces ohmic losses in the subsequent pulse phase.

While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2242072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418003","Brain–computer interfaces (BCI);brain switch;game;hybrid BCI;multimodal;multitasking;virtual reality (VR)","Games;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Training;Brain computer interfaces;Educational institutions;Feature extraction","brain-computer interfaces;computer games;virtual reality","thinking penguin game;multimodal brain computer interface control;VR game;highly immersive CAVE;virtual environment;virtual reality game;jump action;game controller;BCI performance;discrete asynchronous action;visual complexity;task demand;joystick control;hybrid BCI implementation","","49","","51","","23 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The “signal” is normally periodic or deterministic whereas the “noise” is normally stochastic. However, in neural systems, signals are often stochastic. Moreover, periodic signals are applied near neurons to control neural excitability (i.e. deep brain stimulation). We therefore tested the hypothesis that a quasi-periodic signal applied to a neural network could enhance the detection of a stochastic neural signal (reverse stochastic resonance). Using computational methods, a CA1 hippocampal neuron was simulated and a Poisson distributed subthreshold synaptic input (“signal”) was applied to the synaptic terminals. A periodic or quasi periodic pulse train at various frequencies (“noise”) was applied to an extracellular electrode located near the neuron. The mutual information and information transfer rate between the output and input of the neuron were calculated. The results display the signature of stochastic resonance with information transfer reaching a maximum value for increasing power (or frequency) of the “noise”. This result shows that periodic signals applied extracellularly can improve the detection of subthreshold stochastic neural signals. The optimum frequency (110Hz) is similar to that used in patients with Parkinson's suggesting that this phenomenon could play a role in the therapeutic effect of high frequency stimulation.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610731","Action potential;Stochastic resonance;Synaptic noise;Numerical method;Monte Carlo simulation","Stochastic resonance;Resonant frequency;Noise;Extracellular;Neurons;Stochastic processes;Information rates","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;brain;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;nonlinear systems;physiological models;Poisson distribution;signal denoising;stochastic processes;surgery","reverse stochastic resonance;hippocampal CA1 neuron model;counter-intuitive phenomenon;noise addition;deep brain stimulation;quasiperiodic signal;neural network;computational methods;Poisson distributed subthreshold synaptic input;synaptic terminals;quasiperiodic pulse train;extracellular electrode;information transfer rate;stochastic resonance signature;subthreshold stochastic neural signal detection;therapeutic effect;high frequency stimulation;ubiquitous phenomenon;nonlinear system;frequency 110 Hz","Computer Simulation;Deep Brain Stimulation;Hippocampus;Humans;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Neurons;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Stochastic Processes","2","","15","","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several drawbacks of mobile devices have been mentioned so far, such as their limited computational capability, small screen real estate, and, so on, as compared with notebook or desktop computers. However, by fully utilizing the most notable feature of mobile devices, that is, mobility, we can explore possibilities for a new user interface of the devices. In this paper, we use PDAs and propose intuitive information transfer techniques for them, which could not be achieved with notebook or desktop computers. By using the system called Toss-It, a user can send information from the user's PDA to other electronic devices with a ""toss"" or ""swing"" action, as the user would toss a ball or deals cards to others. We have developed a circuit board designed to be attached to a PDA and algorithms for recognizing ""toss"" and ""swing"" actions. Preliminary user studies of Toss-It indicated that it could correctly identify receivers of information by ""toss"" or ""swing"" actions. Our research project is in progress, and this paper describes the current status of the project by focusing on issues related to HCI (human computer interaction). We discuss about several critical issues to be investigated in our future studies.","1550-6193","0-7695-2258-0","10.1109/MCSA.2004.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377323","","Personal digital assistants;Printers;Mobile computing;User interfaces;Human computer interaction;Computer interfaces;Printed circuits;Algorithm design and analysis;Informatics;Optical fiber communication","mobile computing;notebook computers;electronic data interchange;human computer interaction;user interfaces","mobile devices;toss action;swing action;notebook computers;desktop computers;user interface;PDA;intuitive information transfer;Toss-It system;electronic devices;human computer interaction","","6","7","13","","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At any instant, the shape of the muscle signal, motor unit action potential (MUAP), is constant unless there is movement of the position of the electrode or biochemical changes in the muscle due to changes in contraction level. The rate of neuron pulses, whose exact times of occurrence are random in nature, is related to the time duration and force of a muscle contraction. The EMG signal can be modeled as the output signal of a filtered impulse process where the neuron firing pulses are assumed to be the input of a system whose transfer function is the motor unit action potential. Representing the neuron pulses as a point process with random times of occurrence, the higher order statistics based system reconstruction algorithm can be applied to the EMG signal to characterize the motor unit action potential. In this paper, we report results from applying a cepstrum of bispectrum based system reconstruction algorithm to real wired-EMG (wEMG) and surface-EMG (sEMG) signals to estimate the appearance of MUAPs in the Rectus Femoris and Vastus Lateralis muscles while the muscles are at rest and in six other contraction positions. It is observed that the appearance of MUAPs estimated from any EMG (wEMG or sEMG) signal clearly shows evidence of motor unit recruitment and crosstalk, if any, due to activity in neighboring muscles. It is also found that the shape of MUAPs remains the same on loading.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.847525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440598","Electromyographic signals;higher order statistics theory;HOS-based blind deconvolution;motor unit action potential","Higher order statistics;Electromyography;Muscles;Neurons;Signal processing;Shape;Reconstruction algorithms;Electrodes;Transfer functions;Cepstrum","electromyography;statistical analysis;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal reconstruction","higher order statistics;EMG signals;motor unit action potential;nerves;electrode;biochemical changes;muscle contraction;neuron firing pulses;transfer function;system reconstruction algorithm;cepstrum;wired-EMG signals;surface-EMG signals;rectus femoris muscles;vastus lateralis muscles","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electromyography;Humans;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","47","","34","","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, control skill analysis focuses on how to design a state-action map to provide appropriate actions according to the states. Therefore approaches such as dynamic programming and neural networks are employed to compute the appropriate actions for all the states. However, this results in time consuming computation, low robustness and no human control characteristics. Although human control skill is robust, it is subcognitive and difficult to be described by the human operators themselves. In this case, human control trajectory is proposed to record and analyze human control skill. Human control trajectory is just a sequence of the systempsilas states and corresponding human operatorpsilas control actions, sampled at a certain frequency. Taking the advantages of human control trajectories and computation, a new approach is proposed. That is analyzing the human operatorspsila control trajectories to find out the most important states which limit the control effect. And then compute the selected states to set up the local state-action map. After that, based on the computational results and the human control trajectories, synthesize the global state-action map to realize the control skill transformation process. In this paper, a dynamic simulator is used as an example to evaluate the effect of the proposed approach. The results show that this approach can reduce the total computational cost while improve the human operatorpsilas control skill effectively.","2161-816X","978-1-4244-2502-0","10.1109/ICAL.2008.4636260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636260","Machine Learning;Human Control Skill;Human Control Trajectory;State-Action Map;Dynamic Simulator","Humans;Trajectory;Robots;Computational modeling;Arrays;Process control;Robustness","control system analysis;dynamic programming;intelligent robots","state-action map;human control trajectories;human control computation;intelligent robot;cooperative environment;control skill analysis;dynamic programming;neural networks;control skill transformation;dynamic simulator","","1","","19","","30 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper proposes a novel tri-state boost converter without such a zero in the transfer function. The additional degree of freedom introduced in the converter in the form of a freewheeling interval has been exploited through an easy control technique to achieve this. The absence of the RHP zero allows the control scheme to achieve larger bandwidth under closed loop conditions, resulting in fast response. Analytical, simulation and experimental results of the tri-state boost converter have been presented and compared with the classical boost converter both under open loop and under closed loop operating conditions. The results clearly demonstrate the superior dynamic performance of the proposed converter.

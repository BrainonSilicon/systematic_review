"Perception as prediction using general value functions in autonomous driving applications","D. Graves; K. Rezaee; S. Scheideman","Huawei Technologies Canada, Ltd.,Edmonton,Canada; Huawei Technologies Canada, Ltd.,Markham,Canada; University of Alberta,Edmonton,Canada","2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","28 Jan 2020","2019","","","1202","1209","We propose and demonstrate a framework called perception as prediction for autonomous driving that uses general value functions (GVFs) to learn predictions. Perception as prediction learns data-driven predictions relating to the impact of actions on the agent's perception of the world. It also provides a data-driven approach to predict the impact of the anticipated behavior of other agents on the world without explicitly learning their policy or intentions. We demonstrate perception as prediction by learning to predict an agent's front safety and rear safety with GVFs, which encapsulate anticipation of the behavior of the vehicle in front and in the rear, respectively. The safety predictions are learned through random interactions in a simulated environment containing other agents. We show that these predictions can be used to produce similar control behavior to an LQR-based controller in an adaptive cruise control problem as well as provide advanced warning when the vehicle behind is approaching dangerously. The predictions are compact policy-based predictions that support prediction of the long term impact on safety when following a given policy. We analyze two controllers that use the learned predictions in a racing simulator to understand the value of the predictions and demonstrate their use in the real-world on a Clearpath Jackal robot and an autonomous vehicle platform.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968293","","","adaptive control;intelligent robots;learning systems;linear quadratic control;mobile robots;motion control;predictive control;safety;velocity control","adaptive cruise control problem;learned predictions;autonomous vehicle platform;general value functions;autonomous driving applications;GVF;data-driven predictions;data-driven approach;anticipated behavior;safety predictions;control behavior;LQR-based controller;policy-based predictions;agent front safety;agent rear safety;racing simulator;Clearpath Jackal robot","","","","20","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Business incubator programs and also university innovation courses try to provide these services and impart the according knowledge to start-up entrepreneurs. Especially for potential entrepreneurs already in workforce who want to study further it is hard to find time for training sessions or workshops offered by incubators. Virtual 3D Worlds can support the needs of start-up entrepreneurs who cannot participate at local meetings, so that they can build up social contacts to peers, experts and also to potential financiers, but have also the possibility to participate in virtual seminars and workshops to gain the required knowledge. This paper focuses on identifying advantages of using Virtual 3D Worlds to enhance the imparting of the required expertise to start a business and points out ways to improve learning effects. Within this framework a Virtual 3D World especially for incubation services is implemented followed by an evaluation by students, domain experts and also pedagogical and cognitive science experts. Two different and independent studies were used to identify issues and potentials of the designed Virtual Incubator World and should also help to generalize the findings to the field of research.","","978-1-4577-1747-5","10.1109/ICL.2011.6059548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059548","Collaborative Learning Environment;Virtual 3D Worlds;Open Wonderland;Virtual Incubator;Start-Up Entrepreneurship;E-Learning","Business;Collaboration;Conferences;Seminars;Electronic learning;Three dimensional displays;Educational institutions","computer based training;human computer interaction;management education;virtual reality","collaborative learning environment;collaborative training environment;collaborative networking environment;start-up entrepreneurs;virtual 3D worlds;knowledge exchange;university innovation courses;business incubator programs;social contacts;incubation services;virtual incubator world","","6","","16","","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, machine leaning (ML) has been used recently to address the MINLP problems in wireless communications. In this paper, we use imitation learning method to accelerate the B&B algorithm. With invariant problem-independent features and appropriate problem-dependent feature selection for D2D communications, a good auxiliary prune policy can be learned in a supervised manner to speed up the most time-consuming branch process of the B&B algorithm. Moreover, we develop a mixed training strategy to further reinforce the generalization ability and a deep neural network (DNN) with a novel loss function to achieve better dynamic control over optimality and computational complexity.

It is particularly remarkable that this success has been achieved on the basis of comparatively small datasets, given the scale of the problem. One explanation is that this has been accomplished partly by exploiting bias in the datasets rather than developing deeper multi-modal reasoning. This fundamentally limits the generalization of the method, and thus its practical applicability. We propose a method that addresses this problem by introducing counterfactuals in the training. In doing so we leverage structural causal models for counterfactual evaluation to formulate alternatives, for instance, questions that could be asked of the same image set.

Such an example is the variation of lighting conditions, in terms of intensity (high or low luminance) and/or temperature (cold or warm), that have been shown to improve memory, attention and executive functions. In this paper, we investigate the differences between a real and a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) regarding the effects of the lighting conditions on several cognitive functions while we apply, for the first time, certain lighting theories directly into a University level VLE. The first main outcome of our study is that lighting conditions in VLEs affect students' cognitive functions in a similar way to traditional/physical learning environments, i.e. high luminance enhance memory, attention and executive functions when compared with low luminance. Our results indicate that if we need to test a cognitive or learning hypothesis, we can test it directly into a virtual environment since it gives us similar results/outcomes with those triggered in real one. Moreover, our results demonstrate that exposure to blue (cold) lighting in VLEs increase students' scores, in the given pseudoword test, in comparison with their exposure to red (warm) lighting.","","978-0-7381-2346-2","10.1109/IISA50023.2020.9284416","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation; General Secretariat for Research and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284416","virtual learning environment;lighting conditions;color temperature;memory test;executive task;real environments","Neuroscience;Education;Lighting;Virtual environments;Task analysis","cognition;computer aided instruction;virtual reality","virtual learning environments;red lighting;blue lighting;virtual environment;lighting theories;cognitive functions;virtual learning environment;lighting conditions;learning process;architectural neuroscience theories;cognitive neuroscience theories;educational neuroscience theories;virtual reality;lighting variations","","","","25","","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many examples of the use of various software products, which are used to create educational materials in the form of electronic lectures, simulators, presentations, virtual objects based on ideas of augmented reality, etc. In addition to the methodical effects of using these technologies for achieving the best results in mastering the studied material by the students, each technology can be evaluated by the complexity and cost of creating a complete educational product, as well as the time it takes to create it. And often it turns out that an externally effective, expensive solution in practice does not lead to a noticeable improvement in mastering the material at the required level, estimated by the appropriate consolidation of knowledge, skills and competencies.The ability to use the calculator dexterously cannot replace the oral account and the knowledge of the multiplication table, and colorful films - traditional reading of books. The explanation for this lies in the peculiarities of human perception of the surrounding reality and the complex processes of its psycho-emotional perception.Noting this provision, at the same time it should be emphasized that this does not mean denying the effective use of infocommunications in education, or rather in learning. This should be understood as a call for reasonable coexistence of new and traditional methods with their justified and natural modernization and transformation with the use of infocommunications.Based on scientific articles, monographs, meetings, discussions of various scientific problems, the most qualified and experienced educators create the basis of learning - textbooks. It seems that they should provide a description of the relevant discipline at the high scientific level, taking into account the existing multi-level system of education in Russia.Modern infocommunication technologies offer new opportunities in the creation of so-called electronic textbooks, where a broad interconnected educational space is actually organized with the use of multimedia capabilities for displaying information and creating hyperlinks. However, due to this fact, namely the need for mutual linking and coordination, the creation of full-fledged electronic textbooks, in fact global network structures, becomes a complicated and slow process. Therefore, tactically and with understanding of the perspective, it is advisable at present to focus on the formation of electronic fragments of the future global educational infrastructure.To solve this problem, we will assume that the textbook on a particular discipline exists in traditional or some other form. It is necessary to create on its basis the additional, but no less important, methodical materials in the form of lectures for students, testing and controlling complexes, control works and tasks, laboratory work, and so on.","","978-1-5386-6474-2","10.1109/SYNCHROINFO.2018.8457003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457003","educational environment;educational materials;electronic lectures (e-lectures);electronic courses (e-courses);infocommunication technologies;presentation","Standards organizations;Organizations;Testing;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning","computer aided instruction;educational institutions","scientific level;multilevel system;Russia;electronic textbooks;hyperlinks;educational product;infocommunication technologies;interconnected educational space;psycho-emotional perception;human perception;oral account;augmented reality;virtual objects;electronic lectures;educational materials;software products;modern educational institutions;methodical materials;future global educational infrastructure;electronic fragments;full-fledged electronic textbooks;qualified experienced educators;scientific problems;scientific articles;natural modernization;infocommunications","","","","12","","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A general-purpose digital neurochip for the resolution and the learning stages of neural algorithms is presented. It updates neuron states and synaptic coefficients in parallel on input neurons. Using 1.6- mu m CMOS technology, a chip can implement 32 input and 16 output neurons with 16-bit synaptic coefficients. Typical on-chip operation time is 2 mu s. Many circuits can be assembled to simulate structured or large-size nets as well as higher order nets. By choosing adapted parameters, most of the learning rules considered so far for neural networks can be programmed. In particular, the error backpropagation algorithm is implemented by a simple arrangement of chips with optimal use of the chip parallelism and minimal interchip communications. Specification of the required precision for synaptic weights is given by theoretical arguments and numerical simulations: 16 bits per synapse should be sufficient for almost all the cases considered.<>","","","10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=118451","","CMOS integrated circuits;Digital signal processors;Learning systems;Neural networks;Parallel processing;Very-large-scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;digital signal processing chips;learning systems;neural nets;parallel processing;VLSI","parallel processing;VLSI;digital neurochip;neural algorithms;neuron states;synaptic coefficients;CMOS technology;large-size nets;error backpropagation algorithm;chip parallelism;minimal interchip communications;1.6 micron;2 mus","","13","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A promising approach for RL control is experience replay (ER), which learns quickly from a limited amount of data, by repeatedly presenting these data to an underlying RL algorithm. Despite its benefits, ER RL has been studied only sporadically in the literature, and its applications have largely been confined to simulated systems. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate ER RL on real-time control experiments that involve a pendulum swing-up problem and the vision-based control of a goalkeeper robot. These real-time experiments are complemented by simulation studies and comparisons with traditional RL. As a preliminary, we develop a general ER framework that can be combined with essentially any incremental RL technique, and instantiate this framework for the approximate Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. The successful real-time learning results that are presented here are highly encouraging for the applicability of ER RL in practice.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2106494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719642","Experience replay (ER);Q-learning;real-time control;reinforcement learning (RL);robotics;SARSA","Erbium;Trajectory;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Real time systems;Learning;Complexity theory","learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;manipulators;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;pendulums;real-time systems","experience replay;real-time reinforcement learning control;optimal control;nonlinear system;stochastic system;reinforcement-learning algorithm;pendulum swing-up problem;vision-based control;goalkeeper robot;incremental RL technique;approximate Q-learning;SARSA algorithm;state-action-reward-state-action algorithm;robotic manipulator control","","92","","37","","24 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many learning activities can use Wiki to facilitate the processes, such as online glossaries, project reports, and dictionaries. Some EFL (English as a Foreign Language) instructors have paid attention to the popularity of Wiki. Although Wikis are very simple and intuitive for users with information literacy, Wikis need computing environment for each learners to edit Web pages. Generally, an instructor can only conduct a Wiki-based learning activity in a computer classroom. Although mobile learning devices (such as PDAs) for every learner can provide ubiquitous computing environment for a Wiki-based learning activity, this paper suggests another inexpensive way by integrating digital pen with Wiki. Consequently, a learner can annotate an EFL reading with his/her mother tongue by digital pen. After everyone finishes reading, all annotations can be collected into a Wiki system for instruction. Thus, an augmenting Wiki structure is constructed. Finally, learnerspsila satisfactions about annotating in the prototype system are reported in this paper.","","978-1-4244-4437-3","10.1109/ISUVR.2009.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232252","wiki;collaborative learning;English as foreign language;digital pen;annotation","Collaboration;Pervasive computing;Collaborative work;Terminology;Dictionaries;Natural languages;Web pages;Mobile computing;Personal digital assistants;Ubiquitous computing","computer aided instruction;groupware;linguistics;mobile computing;user interfaces;Web sites","collaborative EFL reading;English-as-a-foreign language;digital pen annotation;collaborative learning;information literacy;Web page;computer classroom;mobile learning device","","5","","11","","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, this paper developed novel adaptive emergency control schemes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by leveraging the high-dimensional feature extraction and non-linear generalization capabilities of DRL for complex power systems. Furthermore, an open-source platform named Reinforcement Learning for Grid Control (RLGC) has been designed for the first time to assist the development and benchmarking of DRL algorithms for power system control. Details of the platform and DRL-based emergency control schemes for generator dynamic braking and under-voltage load shedding are presented.

Generally, this dynamic data is generated by the interactions which take place in the virtual learning environment. At the present time, many implementations for grouping of data have been proposed, but there is no consensus yet on which interactions and groups must be measured and analyzed. There is also no agreement on what is the influence of these interactions, if any, on learning outcomes, academic performance or student success. This study presents three different extant interaction typologies in e-learning and analyzes the relation of their components with students' academic performance. The three different classifications are based on the agents involved in the learning process, the frequency of use and the participation mode, respectively. The main findings from the research are: a) that agent-based classifications offer a better explanation of student academic performance; b) that at least one component in each typology predicts academic performance; and c) that student-teacher and student-student, evaluating students, and active interactions, respectively, have a significant impact on academic performance, while the other interaction types are not significantly related to academic performance.","","978-84-939814-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403184","interactions;learning analytics;academic performance;typologies","Data mining;Electronic learning;Context;Databases;Real-time systems;Data analysis;Humans","computer aided instruction;student experiments;virtual reality","learning analytics;virtual learning environments;interaction classifications;student success;e-learning;agent-based classifications;student academic performance;student-teacher interactions;student-student interactions","","","","27","","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The DE model frames cognition as an extended form of function synthesis. It consists of a parameterized mapping M and two process stages that rely upon M: a discovery stage during which the values of the parameters of M are discovered (with or without human intervention) and an exploitation stage during which the exercising of M is performed using the values obtained during the discovery stage. The exploitation stage is said to ""exploit"" the generalization capabilities of M by inferring acceptable output values for input values that have never been seen before by the DE Model. The use of the DE Model as a guide for constructing computational implementations of cognition is demonstrated M is instantiated as a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), the discovery stage is performed with an Evolutionary Search (ES) strategy that discovers input-output pairs required to identify the parameters of the FIS, and the exploitation stage is performed by passing novel input values through the FIS to produce the matching output value. This implementation is applied to the problem of robotic manipulator motor control for a three-jointed arm with movement in three dimensions. The author speculates that all other models of cognition can be subsumed by the DE Model. If this is so, then the DE Model provides a common descriptive framework which would facilitate discussion, comparison and integration of different cognitive models and implementations of those models.","1062-922X","0-7803-4053-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1997.637547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=637547","","Computational modeling;Equations;Cognition;Unsupervised learning;Fuzzy systems;Assembly;Nervous system;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model","cognitive systems;fuzzy control;intelligent control;manipulators;position control;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning systems;adaptive control","discovery-exploitation model;cognition;function synthesis;parameterized mapping;discovery stage;human intervention;exploitation stage;Fuzzy Inference System;Evolutionary Search;input-output pairs;robotic manipulator motor control;three-jointed arm;3D movement;descriptive framework;learning control;intelligent control","","","","8","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgical performance. The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene. Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance. The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons. An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training. The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis. The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing. Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.869771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597490","Dynamics;haptics;human machine interface;kinematics;manipulation;Markov model;minimally invasive;robotics;simulation;soft tissue;surgery;surgical skill assessment;surgical tool;vector quantization","Minimally invasive surgery;Stochastic processes;Kinematics;Performance analysis;Multidimensional systems;Information analysis;Information resources;Layout;Animal structures;Protocols","surgery;Markov processes;endoscopes;medical robotics;virtual reality;robot kinematics","minimally invasive surgery;stochastic process;discrete Markov model;visual information;surgical tool kinematics;surgical tool dynamics;Blue DRAGON;endoscopic tools;finite state model;objective learning curve;subjective performance analysis;laparoscopic suturing;surgical robots;virtual reality simulators","Computer Simulation;Endoscopes;Endoscopy;Expert Systems;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Markov Chains;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Robotics;Robotics;Stochastic Processes;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive;Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface","160","3","47","","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a geographic region, and associated power estimates linked to the transmitter placements, our objective is to develop machine learning models to predict the strength of the radio signals. BACKGROUND: The propagation model is often used to determine the optimal location of radio transmitters in order to optimize the power coverage in a geographic area of interest. However, it is often a costly operation to obtain the exact power measurements over a region for a given set of transmitter locations. Therefore, fast prediction methods are needed to estimate the power values given limited data. METHODOLOGY: We consider a dataset consisting of simulated power at each point in an environment for a given set of transmitter locations. We experiment with various machine learning models, namely, generalized linear models (GLMs), neural networks (NNs), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), to estimate the power values for a given transmitter placement. We investigate various feature engineering approaches to enhance the predictive performance of the machine learning models. RESULTS: We observe that employed feature engineering methods such as polynomial degrees and transmitter to cluster distances significantly improve the prediction accuracy. In particular, GLM model performance notably improves thanks to these extracted features, where mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced around 77% from 11.37 dB to 2.55 dB. We note that KNN with k = 2 and DNN models perform better than NN and GLM. KNN has the best performance with an average MAE of 0.65dB and also substantially faster to train than NN/DNN models. In addition, our analysis shows that, to train a well-performing machine learning model, it is sufficient to use a dataset consisting of measurements at a fraction of the potential transmitter locations in a given region. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning methods are highly effective for the coverage prediction task. Using carefully engineered features, simple models such as GLMs and KNNs can be as effective as more complex ones, especially for small datasets.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3035442","Communications Research Centre Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247298","Machine learning;radio coverage;transmitter placement;k-nearest neighbor;generalized linear models;neural networks","Predictive models;Radio transmitters;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Artificial neural networks;Mathematical model","learning (artificial intelligence);nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;radio networks;radio transmitters;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network planning","GLM model performance;machine learning model;potential transmitter locations;coverage prediction task;Machine learning-based radio coverage prediction;reliable prediction model;radio signal strength;radio network;associated power estimates;transmitter placements;propagation model;radio transmitters;power coverage;exact power measurements;fast prediction methods;generalized linear models;predictive performance enhancement;prediction accuracy;neural networks;k-nearest neighbor;KNN;feature engineering approaches;mean absolute error;NN-DNN models","","","","35","IEEE","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, such general rules cannot reflect the personal preferences of a single individual, which vary from person to person. In this paper, we intend to optimize a functional workspace according to the personal preferences of the specific individual who will use it. We come up with an approach to learn the individual's personal preferences from his activities while using a virtual version of the workspace via virtual reality devices. Then, we construct a cost function, which incorporates personal preferences, spatial constraints, pose assessments, and visual field. At last, the cost function is optimized to achieve an optimal layout. To evaluate the approach, we experimented with different settings.

Similar learner groupings for project-based learning through hidden patterns extraction can aid Active Learning and Instructor Monitoring. In our previous paper, K-means clustering algorithm was used to group learners with similar scores in three assessments. In this paper, we built a classifier model using the J48 Decision Tree Algorithm for predicting learner groupings after getting class labels through the K-means clustering algorithm. This classifier will help in predicting future groupings of learners for the same course and attributes.

It becomes possible with the maturity and commercialization of 5G technology. However, to transmit VR video streaming over wireless communication system, we must cope with the challenge that fluctuation exists in the wireless channel conditions. For example, available channel bandwidth, packet loss rate, and interference level may vary with time due to channel fading and user's mobility. The problem is more prominent when transmitting naked-eye 3D video which generally consists of multiple viewpoints with different resolutions. In order to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of watching naked-eye VR video over wireless networks, this paper proposes a network-assisted neural adaptive video streaming algorithm (NAVSA). Specifically, we present a modified QoE function to describe the quality of naked-eye 3D streaming quantitatively, which not only considers the quality of naked-eye 3D video itself, but also considers the phenomenon of rebuffering and video fluctuation that occurs during video transmission. Next, with the network-assisted feedback, the physical layer information, the buffer occupancy of the video client, and the size of the next video chunk are collected to train a reinforcement learning model. Based on dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), the model can automatically choose appropriate viewpoints and resolutions corresponding to the current condition of the wireless networks such that the network capacity can be fully explored. To verify the performance of our proposed NAVSA, we simulate 3 naked-eye 3D video application scenarios on the NS3 platform. The results show that the performance of NAVSA is about 5~8% better than some state-of-the-art algorithms in wireless networks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852692","Reinforcement learning;adaptive transmission;naked-eye 3D;network assistance;wireless networks","Streaming media;Three-dimensional displays;Quality of experience;Wireless networks;Bandwidth;Adaptive systems;Reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication;bandwidth allocation;channel allocation;fading channels;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);neural nets;quality of experience;radiofrequency interference;transport protocols;video streaming;virtual reality","naked-eye 3D video;naked-eye 3D video application;5G technology;quality of experience;NAVSA;reinforcement learning model;dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP;DASH;network-assisted neural adaptive video streaming algorithm;naked-eye VR video;channel bandwidth;wireless channel conditions;wireless communication system;Virtual Reality video;network-assisted neural adaptive naked-eye 3D video streaming;NS3 platform;wireless networks;network-assisted feedback;video transmission","","","","45","CCBY","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the training phase, the disadvantage of some CMAC models with a larger fixed learning rate is the unstable phenomenon. The smaller learning rate would cause slower convergence speed. In the aspect, we propose grey learning rate for training phase. We incorporate the grey relational analysis with the number of training iterations to get an adequate learning rate for better convergence performance. In addition, a serious problem of learning interference reduces learning speed and accuracy. The idea is that the error correcting must be proportional to the inverse of learning times, trained input area and grey relational grade for the addressed hyper cube. A credit apportionment adopts the idea to provide fast and accurate learning effects. This paper proposes a novel learning framework of CMAC for better performance and real-time applications. From the simulation results, it is evident that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate and fast convergence in the early cycles of training phase and also becomes significant in the follow-up cycles.","2160-1348","978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620940","CMAC;Learning interference;credit apportionment;grey relational analysis;grey relational grade","Training;Mathematical model;Equations;Accuracy;Machine learning;Interference;Convergence","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;grey systems;learning systems;nonlinear functions","CMAC;grey-area-time credit apportionment;grey learning rate;neural network;nonlinear functions mapping","","","","12","","5 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally e-learning available in the form of web based application, but does not exist in the form of mobile application yet. Problem that arise when using a mobile device is the screen size is too small, so that the user need to zoom and scroll to get comfortable viewing. Another problem is the user using varying operating system such as android, blackberry and iOS. To overcome those problems, this research is conducted to assist in the teaching-learning process by developing a model of mobile e-learning application that can run on cross-platform, which is on Android and BlackBerry platform. The application is created using PhoneGap that uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript based on Hybrid Mobile Application. The system on the application follows Lentera e-learning system based on Moodle. Lentera is a web based e-learning system used in Petra Charistian University. On the server side, it takes a modified Moodle's source code based on PHP so the application can be run in accordance with the system. The application has a different interface from the website version. The interface is designed to be suitable on smartphone which is has limited screen space. The result shows that the application can run on cross-platform, those are Blackberry and Android smartphone. The application also runs online together with the Lentera website. The basic features of Lentera have been successfully implemented on this application. Assessment of the application as a whole is more than 50% of respondents answered very good.","","978-1-4799-0145-6","10.1109/ICTSS.2013.6588081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588081","mobile learning;Hybrid Mobile Application;smart phone;android;blackberry;cross platform;phonegap","Mobile communication;Smart phones;Operating systems;HTML;Electronic learning;Browsers","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;hypermedia markup languages;Java;mobile computing;smart phones;teaching","hybrid mobile application technology;Android smartphone;Blackberry;universities;e-learning;teaching-learning process;mobile application;iOS;mobile e-learning application;HTML5;CSS3;JavaScript;Lentera e-learning system;Moodle;Petra Charistian University;website version;Lentera website","","2","","7","","2 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This way, FL can potentially reduce the information on the local data sets that is leaked via communications. In order to provide formal privacy guarantees, however, it is generally necessary to put in place additional masking mechanisms. When FL is implemented in wireless systems via uncoded transmission, the channel noise can directly act as a privacy-inducing mechanism. This paper demonstrates that, as long as the privacy constraint level, measured via differential privacy (DP), is below a threshold that decreases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uncoded transmission achieves privacy âfor freeâ, i.e., without affecting the learning performance. More generally, this work studies adaptive power allocation (PA) for distributed gradient descent in wireless FL with the aim of minimizing the learning optimality gap under privacy and power constraints. Both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission with âover-the-air-computingâ are studied, and solutions are obtained in closed form for an offline optimization setting. Furthermore, heuristic online methods are proposed that leverage iterative one-step-ahead optimization. The importance of dynamic PA and the potential benefits of NOMA versus OMA are demonstrated through extensive simulations.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.3036948","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9252950","Federated learning;differential privacy;adaptive power control;uncoded transmission","Privacy;Servers;NOMA;Wireless communication;Protocols;Resource management;Data models","adaptive control;data privacy;gradient methods;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;multi-access systems;optimisation;power control;protocols;telecommunication control","wireless federated learning;uncoded transmission;adaptive power control;distributed protocols;direct raw data exchange;local data sets;formal privacy guarantees;masking mechanisms;wireless systems;channel noise;privacy-inducing mechanism;privacy constraint level;differential privacy;adaptive power allocation;distributed gradient descent;wireless FL;learning optimality gap;power constraints;offline optimization setting;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;nonorthogonal multiple access;iterative one-step-ahead optimization;heuristic online methods;over-the-air-computing","","","","45","IEEE","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, this paper develops a deep learning-based JADCE framework which consists of a dimension reduction module, a deep learning network module, an active device detection module, and a channel estimation module. In particular, a deep learning network is developed for the recovery of device state matrix based on a designed denoiser, which can adaptively adjust the density parameters characterizing the device state matrix and effectively adapt to general complex channel settings with a finite number of training data.

In the majority of LNCSs the fine-tuning process is performed by experienced personnel based on field observations via experimentation with different combinations of controller parameters, without the use of a systematic approach. The existing adaptive/neural/fuzzy control methodologies cannot be used towards the development of a systematic, automated fine-tuning procedure for general LNCS due to the strict assumptions they impose on the controlled system dynamics; on the other hand, adaptive optimization methodologies fail to guarantee an efficient and safe performance during the fine-tuning process, mainly due to the fact that these methodologies involve the use of random perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and analyze, both by means of mathematical arguments and simulation experiments, a new learning/adaptive algorithm that can provide with convergent, an efficient and safe fine-tuning of general LNCS. The proposed algorithm consists of a combination of two different algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos (2007 and 2008) and the incremental-extreme learning machine neural networks (I-ELM-NNs). Among the nice properties of the proposed algorithm is that it significantly outperforms the algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos as well as other existing adaptive optimization algorithms. Moreover, contrary to the algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos , the proposed algorithm can operate efficiently in the case where the exogenous system inputs (e.g., disturbances, commands, demand, etc.) are unbounded signals.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2014061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4814570","Adaptive fine-tuning;adaptive optimization;incremental-extreme learning machine neural networks (I-ELM-NNs);nonlinear control systems;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)","Large-scale systems;Nonlinear control systems;Automatic control;Control systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Intelligent control;Personnel;Fuzzy control;Optimization methods","adaptive control;intelligent control;large-scale systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimisation;perturbation techniques","large scale nonlinear control system fine-tuning;intelligent control;intelligent computing;fuzzy control methodologies;adaptive control;neural control;adaptive optimization methodologies;random perturbations;learning-adaptive algorithm;incremental-extreme learning machine neural networks;adaptive optimization algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Models, Theoretical;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated","56","","24","","14 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As with most controllers, the design of GANFIS controllers requires proper parameter selection as well as tuning due to variations in the plant or environment. Evolutionary learning has been shown to be feasible to tune these parameters, but there may be some difficulty in selecting the learning factors. Previously, we addressed this problem by designing a fitness function containing both prediction and heuristics for measuring system performance and extending the approach by integrating simulated annealing features for faster convergence. In this paper, we employ a tuning strategy based upon the Hamming distance to select the key convergence parameters of the evolutionary learning algorithm: the cross-over and mutation rates. To study the approach, we compare the case when simulated annealing is applied for constant values; then an adaptive tuned version of the simulated annealing algorithms is applied. Results show that by tuning, the GANFIS controllers produce an overall tracking performance with a lower error trajectory, thus illustrating the feasibility of this additional feature of the GANFIS controller.","","978-1-4577-0966-1","10.1109/IRI.2011.6009510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009510","evolutionary computation;heuristics;fuzzy systems;neural networks;Hamming distance","Tuning;Hamming distance;Convergence;Simulated annealing;Noise;Biological cells;Evolutionary computation","adaptive control;control system synthesis;evolutionary computation;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;parameter estimation;robust control;simulated annealing;tuning","Hamming distance tuning;adaptive neural network fuzzy inference controller;evolutionary simulated annealing;robust controller design;GANFIS control;parameter selection;evolutionary learning;fitness function;tuning strategy;adaptive tuned version;tracking performance;error trajectory","","","","14","","5 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing learning immediately after the experience but we extend our attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger. A knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover, subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we discuss in the paper.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391853","Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014255","Immersive VR;serious games;user evaluation;knowledge retention;physiological measurements;aviation safety;Immersive VR;serious games;user evaluation;knowledge retention;physiological measurements;aviation safety","Games;Safety;Aircraft;Education;Materials;Avatars;Engines","avionics;computer aided instruction;computer games;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","knowledge retention;consumer head-mounted displays;educational applications;immersive VR;gaming elements;immersive serious games;safety materials;HMD-based immersive game;aircraft emergency;aviation safety education method;airlines;safety knowledge acquisition;safety procedures;knowledge test;safety card;physiological measurements;superior retention","Accidents, Aviation;Aviation;Computer Graphics;Humans;User-Computer Interface;Video Games","99","","59","","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a dual-path deep CNN (TDCNN) TSR model is built based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the cost function and recognition accuracy are selected as indicators to analyze the training results of the model. Second, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) RNN are utilized to assess the road traffic safety risks, and the prediction and evaluation effects of them are compared. Finally, the changes in safety risks of road traffic accidents are analyzed based on the two key influencing factors of the number of road intersections and the speed of vehicles traveling. The results show that the learning rate of the network model and the number of hidden neurons in the fully-connected layer directly affect the training results, and there are differences in the choices between the early and late training periods. Compared with RNN, the LSTM network model has higher evaluation accuracy, and its corresponding root square error (RSE) is 0.36. The rational control of the number of intersections and the speed of roads traveled has a significant impact on improving the safety level and promoting road traffic efficiency.

How to use communication technologies to improve mobile learning is an important topic in electronic education. Meanwhile, media selection can be a critical issue of supporting various reader devices and providing potential benefits. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is one method of information exchange that is especially suitable for various front-end devices to read information. This paper aims to assess a ubiquitous learning environment through RSS and analyze communication media richness with RSS, SMS and E-mail based on media richness theory. Moreover, in order to evaluate the preferences toward using RSS into ubiquitous learning environment, student satisfaction is also assessed. Experimental results revealed that ubiquitous learning system by using RSS can greatly promote instructor-learners interaction and learners participation in curriculum activities but have no influence in learners cognition and metacognition. In terms of media richness, RSS is more suitable media for ubiquitous learning environment. According to the results, we suggest that current general e-learning systems can take advantage of RSS techniques to support mobile access and achieve the goal of ubiquitous learning anytime and anywhere.","1944-9410","978-1-4244-3808-2","10.1109/VECIMS.2009.5068910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068910","Ubiquitous learning;Media richness theory;RSS;Student satisfaction","Mobile communication;Information management;Communications technology;Portable computers;Virtual environment;Anthropometry;Learning systems;Cognition;Electronic learning;Information processing","computer aided instruction;electronic messaging;mobile computing;multimedia computing","RSS;media richness theory;mobile devices;mobile learning;electronic education;Really Simple Syndication;information exchange;ubiquitous learning environment;SMS;e-mail;instructor-learners interaction;learner cognition;metacognition;e-learning systems","","1","","23","","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An emerging and promising trend in this regard is the development of solutions that aim at maximizing the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end users. However, predicting the QoE perceived by the users in different conditions remains a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to support QoE-based Video Admission Control (VAC) and Resource Management (RM) algorithms. More specifically, we develop a learning system that can automatically extract the quality-rate characteristics of unknown video sequences from the size of H.264-encoded video frames. Our approach combines unsupervised feature learning with supervised classification techniques, thereby providing an efficient and scalable way to estimate the QoE parameters that characterize each video. This QoE characterization is then used to manage simultaneous video transmissions through a shared channel in order to guarantee a minimum quality level to the final users. Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based QoE classification of video sequences outperforms commonly deployed off-line video analysis techniques and that the QoE-based VAC and RM algorithms outperform standard content-agnostic strategies.","","978-1-4799-5258-8","10.1109/MedHocNet.2014.6849102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849102","","Streaming media;Polynomials;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Ad hoc networks;Video sequences","cellular radio;quality of experience;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication control;unsupervised learning;video coding;wireless channels","video transmissions;supervised classification;unsupervised feature learning;H.264-encoded video frames;unknown video sequences;quality-rate characteristics;resource management;end users;cellular networks;video traffic;resource allocation;QoE-based VAC;QoE-based video admission control;quality of experience;machine learning;wireless systems","","26","","26","","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We report results from a side-by-side study that replaces lecture with screen movies for three of ten lab sections in a high enrollment, computer tools and problem solving course.

Considering the ever-increasing complexity of the network, and the emergence of novel use cases such as autonomous cars, industrial automation, virtual reality, e-health, and several intelligent applications, machine learning (ML) is expected to be essential to assist in making the 5G vision conceivable. This paper focuses on the potential solutions for 5G from an ML-perspective. First, we establish the fundamental concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, taking a look at what has been done so far in the adoption of ML in the context of mobile and wireless communication, organizing the literature in terms of the types of learning. We then discuss the promising approaches for how ML can contribute to supporting each target 5G network requirement, emphasizing its specific use cases and evaluating the impact and limitations they have on the operation of the network. Lastly, this paper investigates the potential features of Beyond 5G (B5G), providing future research directions for how ML can contribute to realizing B5G.

We have developed a mobile learning system, composed of a collaborative learning model and a network agent service model. The system can be deployed over a heterogeneous network of mobile wireless devices and wired devices, ranging from PDAs to desktop PCs. The collaborative learning system, based on traditional C/S (client-server) architecture, includes some basic discussion tools. The client side is implemented in the form of an applet, which can communicate with the server side located on the Web server. Teachers and students can communicate through the Web page browsers of PDAs or PCs. The network agent service model, which acts as an HTTP agency, can transform the text and images in HTML pages into an appropriate size and format that can be displayed by the PDA browser, according to the size of its screen.

Natural and unobtrusive methods like those offered by machine learning approaches are more desired by users. So far, the research on machine learning applications in museums is mostly limited to art authentication, guiding and virtual reality. Yet, machine learning has powerful methods to extract information from any type of data and therefore there are other interesting applications which can have a significant effect on museum experience. The current work is an attempt to find an abstract and yet elaborate view into the existing machine learning applications in museums in general and automatic guide methods in particular. To do so, applications are grouped into different categories and for each category the usefulness of applying machine learning along with the existing methods, if any, are presented. Furthermore, a precise explanation on new directions accompanied by examples is provided. We expect this paper to be of interest to the machine learning researchers since it provides a guideline to proper directions of research in this realm.","","978-1-5386-2585-9","10.1109/AISP.2017.8324080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8324080","machine learning application;computer vision;museum experience;automatic guide;museum data analysis","Mobile handsets;Computer vision;Art;Cameras;Learning (artificial intelligence);Data mining","learning (artificial intelligence);museums;virtual reality","museums;machine learning approaches;virtual reality;automatic guide methods;user experience improvement","","1","","32","","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Kernel-Based Least Squares Policy Iteration for Reinforcement Learning","X. Xu; D. Hu; X. Lu","Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha; Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha; Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","9 Jul 2007","2007","18","4","973","992","In this paper, we present a kernel-based least squares policy iteration (KLSPI) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) in large or continuous state spaces, which can be used to realize adaptive feedback control of uncertain dynamic systems. By using KLSPI, near-optimal control policies can be obtained without much a priori knowledge on dynamic models of control plants. In KLSPI, Mercer kernels are used in the policy evaluation of a policy iteration process, where a new kernel-based least squares temporal-difference algorithm called KLSTD-Q is proposed for efficient policy evaluation. To keep the sparsity and improve the generalization ability of KLSTD-Q solutions, a kernel sparsification procedure based on approximate linear dependency (ALD) is performed. Compared to the previous works on approximate RL methods, KLSPI makes two progresses to eliminate the main difficulties of existing results. One is the better convergence and (near) optimality guarantee by using the KLSTD-Q algorithm for policy evaluation with high precision. The other is the automatic feature selection using the ALD-based kernel sparsification. Therefore, the KLSPI algorithm provides a general RL method with generalization performance and convergence guarantee for large-scale Markov decision problems (MDPs). Experimental results on a typical RL task for a stochastic chain problem demonstrate that KLSPI can consistently achieve better learning efficiency and policy quality than the previous least squares policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. Furthermore, the KLSPI method was also evaluated on two nonlinear feedback control problems, including a ship heading control problem and the swing up control of a double-link underactuated pendulum called acrobot. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can optimize controller performance using little a priori information of uncertain dynamic systems. It is also demonstrated that KLSPI can be applied to online learning control by incorporating an initial controller to ensure online performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2007.899161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267723","Approximate dynamic programming;kernel methods;least squares;Markov decision problems (MDPs);reinforcement learning (RL)","Least squares methods;Learning;Kernel;Feedback control;Least squares approximation;State-space methods;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Linear approximation;Convergence","adaptive control;feedback;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;Markov processes;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;state-space methods;uncertain systems","kernel-based least squares policy iteration;reinforcement learning;continuous state spaces;adaptive feedback control;uncertain dynamic systems;near-optimal control policy;control plants;Mercer kernels;policy evaluation;kernel-based least squares temporal-difference algorithm;generalization ability;kernel sparsification procedure;approximate linear dependency;large-scale Markov decision problems;stochastic chain problem;least squares policy iteration algorithm;nonlinear feedback control;ship heading control problem;swing up control;double-link underactuated pendulum;acrobot;online learning control","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Feedback;Least-Squares Analysis;Markov Chains;Models, Theoretical;Reinforcement (Psychology)","155","","47","","9 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The widespread use of FPGA devices has created a necessity for understanding the inner logic using diagrams or theoretical explanations. This paper presents an innovative approach for FPGA basic architecture learning called GASIM. A conceptually complete model for a simple but general 2-D graphical FPGA has been designed and implemented in such a way that is easy to understand, aesthetically appealing from the student's point of view, and also easy to use by any teacher. The aim of this kind of design is to fill the conceptual gap we have found while teaching FPGA based courses. The final tool is a 2-D modular graphical library for a standalone logic simulator that not only allows teachers and students to program an FPGA model and simulate every aspect of its internal logic complexities but also to construct their own limited, but complete FPGA structure using drag and drop graphical modules and programmable interconnections.

Two RNNs, based on the same network architecture, are utilized in the learning control system. One is used to approximate the nonlinear system, and the other is used to mimic the desired system response output. The learning rule is achieved by combining the two RNNs to form the neural network control system. A generalized real-time iterative learning algorithm is developed and used to train the RNNs. The algorithm is derived by means of two-dimensional (2-D) system theory that is different from the conventional algorithms that employ the steepest optimization to minimize a cost function. This paper shows that an RNN using the real-time iterative learning algorithm can approximate any trajectory tracking to a very high degree of accuracy. The proposed learning control scheme is applied to numerical problems, and simulation results are included. The results are very promising, and this paper suggests that the 2-D system theory-based RNN learning algorithm provides a new dimension in real-time neural control systems.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.661316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=661316","","Recurrent neural networks;Iterative algorithms;Control systems;Real time systems;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Neural networks;Two dimensional displays;Cost function","nonlinear control systems;nonlinear dynamical systems;neurocontrollers;recurrent neural nets;learning systems;real-time systems;learning (artificial intelligence);control system synthesis;control system analysis","recurrent neural network;real-time learning control strategy;nonlinear dynamical systems;unknown dynamics;system response;learning rule;control design;neural network control system;generalized real-time iterative learning algorithm;2-D system theory;real-time iterative learning algorithm;control simulation;trajectory tracking;learning algorithm","","167","","18","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

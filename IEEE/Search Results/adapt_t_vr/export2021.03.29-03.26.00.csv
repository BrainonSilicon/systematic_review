"A case study in local area migration to ATM","V. J. Friesen; J. W. Wong","Dept. of Comput.

These devices provide the capability for an ATM switched internetwork. In general, a switched internetwork consists of an ATM backbone and a number of hubs. The hubs, by providing ATM adaptation functionality, serve as access points to the ATM backbone for servers and clients. The objective of our study is to evaluate alternative strategies for migrating towards an ATM switched internetwork. Our investigation is based on a local area network providing interconnection for a group of clients and servers in a campus environment. A number of different configurations may, at various stages of migration, comprise the interconnection media for this local area network. The network components that are considered in this migration process are Ethernets, both shared and dedicated, multiplexers, hubs, ATM switches, and ATM-equipped end devices. A simulation model is developed to study the performance of the different configurations. Simulation results for end-to-end delay and loss are presented for each alternative configuration.","","0-8186-7180-7","10.1109/ICCCN.1995.540157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=540157","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Internet;Switches;Spine;Network servers;Web server;Local area networks;LAN interconnection;File servers;Ethernet networks","asynchronous transfer mode;switching networks;LAN interconnection;multiplexing equipment;telecommunication network routing;digital simulation;simulation;performance evaluation;delays","local area migration;routers;local ATM;ATM switched internetwork;switching hubs;ATM-equipped end devices;ATM backbone;ATM adaptation;servers;clients;local area network;campus environment;network configurations;network components;Ethernets;multiplexers;ATM switches;simulation model;network performance;simulation results;end-to-end delay;end-to-end loss","","","","21","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike the unspecified bit rate (UBR) service, the ABR service does provide congestion feedback. The effects of three specific MPEG-1 video source adaptation schemes, arbitrary loss or no control method, selective discard of MPEG B pictures, and selective discard of MPEG B and P pictures, on network performance are compared.

To improve the timing analysis efficiency of the finite-difference method, the dominant poles are obtained by introducing the PVL algorithm for model-order reduction.

It is assumed that the sender and receiver of the adaptive window protocol are colocated with the rate-control endpoints. The objective of the study is to understand if the interaction of the rate-control loop and the window-control loop is beneficial for end-to-end throughput, and how the parameters of the problem (propagation delay, bottleneck buffers, and rate of variation of the available bottleneck bandwidth) affect the performance. The available bottleneck bandwidth is modeled as a two-state Markov chain. We develop an analysis that explicitly models the bottleneck buffers, the delayed explicit rate feedback, and TCP's adaptive window mechanism. The analysis, however, applies only when the variations in the available bandwidth occur over periods larger than the round-trip delay. For fast variations of the bottleneck bandwidth, we provide results from a simulation on a TCP testbed that uses Linux TCP code, and a simulation/emulation of the network model inside the Linux kernel. We find that, over end-to-end ABR, the performance of TCP improves significantly if the network bottleneck bandwidth variations are slow as compared to the round-trip propagation delay. Further, we find that TCP over ABR is relatively insensitive to bottleneck buffer size. These results are for a short-term average link capacity feedback at the ABR level (INSTCAP). We use the testbed to study EFFCAP feedback, which is motivated by the notion of the effective capacity of the bottleneck link. We find that EFFCAP feedback is adaptive to the rate of bandwidth variations at the bottleneck link, and thus yields good performance (as compared to INSTCAP) over a wide range of the rate of bottleneck bandwidth variation. Finally, we study if TCP over ABR, with EFFCAP feedback, provides throughput fairness even if the connections have different round-trip propagation delays.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.944337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944337","","Stochastic processes;Bandwidth;Feedback;Propagation delay;Throughput;Testing;Linux;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Protocols","transport protocols;delays;telecommunication congestion control;buffer storage;channel capacity;feedback;digital simulation;operating systems (computers);telecommunication traffic;Markov processes;adaptive systems;asynchronous transfer mode;packet switching;performance evaluation;wide area networks;local area networks","TCP performance;end-to-end rate control;stochastic available capacity;end-to-end ABR;performance;adaptive window congestion control;elastic traffic;stochastically time varying bandwidth;adaptive window protocol;rate-control endpoints;rate-control loop;window-control loop;end-to-end throughput;bottleneck buffer size;bottleneck buffers;available bottleneck bandwidth variation;available bottleneck bandwidth;two-state Markov chain;delayed explicit rate feedback;short-term average link capacity feedback;simulation results;TCP testbed;Linux TCP code;network model simulation/emulation;Linux kernel;round-trip propagation delay;EFFCAP feedback;INSTCAP;throughput fairness;explicit feedback rate-control mechanism;ATM network;ATM LAN;ATM WAN","","20","","21","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A stochastic multipath channel model including path directions for indoor environments","T. Zwick; C. Fischer; W. Wiesbeck","Inst. fur Hochstfrequenztechnik und Elektron., Karlsruhe Univ., Germany; NA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","7 Nov 2002","2002","20","6","1178","1192","A novel stochastic channel model for the indoor propagation channel is presented. It is especially for, but not limited to future communication systems with multiple antennas like space division multiple access (SDMA), spatial filtering for interference reduction (SFIR), or multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO). The model is designed for indoor scenarios, straight forward extendable to urban environments. It is based on physical wave propagation. The new approach describes the channel by multipath components, each characterized by its transfer matrix (including loss), delay, direction of arrival, and departure. The appearance and disappearance of multipath components over time is modeled as a birth and death process, a marked Poisson process. This enables first-time the correct modeling of spatial and temporal correlations. In each modeling step, path properties change according to the motion of transmitter and receiver. The changing delay times of propagation paths yield a realistic Doppler behavior of the channel. Deterministic ray tracing results are used to produce the huge data sets required for the statistical evaluation of the parameters of the proposed model. This method enables an automated parameter extraction for new environments or frequencies. The ray tracing tool has been verified by narrowband, wideband, and directional channel measurements. The novel stochastic spatial channel model allows the simulation of third-generation broadband radio systems including arbitrary antenna configurations and patterns. System simulations for the bit-error rate of radio links can be performed including intelligent antenna configurations like SDMA, SFIR, or MIMO. Furthermore, the capacity of complete systems can be investigated.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021910","","Stochastic processes;Multipath channels;Indoor environments;Multiaccess communication;MIMO;Ray tracing;Broadband antennas;Antennas and propagation;Filtering;Interference","indoor radio;radiowave propagation;space division multiple access;filtering theory;interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;fading channels;multipath channels;multiuser channels;broadband networks;radio networks;land mobile radio;MIMO systems;adaptive antenna arrays;digital simulation;ray tracing;stochastic processes","stochastic multipath channel model;path directions;indoor environments;indoor propagation channel;multiple antennas;space division multiple access;SDMA;spatial filtering;interference reduction;multiple-input/multiple-output system;urban environments;physical wave propagation;multipath components;transfer matrix;loss;delay;direction of arrival;birth and death process;Poisson process;spatial correlation;temporal correlation;transmitter;receiver;delay times;Doppler behavior;deterministic ray tracing;statistical evaluation;automated parameter extraction;directional channel measurements;wideband measurements;narrowband measurements;system simulation;bit-error rate;radio links;intelligent antenna configurations;systems capacity;third-generation broadband radio systems;antenna configurations;antenna patterns","","124","1","37","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modern disks use zone-bit-recording (ZBR) technology to increase the capacity. A direct consequence of ZBR is that outer tracks have higher data transfer rates. Because LFS uses large disk transfers, access times are mainly determined by the data transfer rate. This paper presents a novel performance-oriented data reorganizing scheme, called PROFS, which boosts the I/O performance of LFS (log-structured file system). Our scheme reorganizes data on the disk during LFS garbage collection and system idle periods. By putting active data in the faster zones and inactive data in the slower zones, we can significantly improve the read and write performance. The reorganization overhead is minimal. We studied three different algorithms that are read-optimized, write-optimized and balanced. Simulation results based on five real-world and two synthetic traces showed that such algorithms can dramatically reduce the I/O response time for both reads and writes compared with the previous LFS systems with adaptive methods. Our algorithms improve the LFS system's write latency by up to 24.5% and the read latency by up to 21.3%.

Today's urban regions serve as an excellent example of such systems. People and institutions confront the implications of the increasing scale of information becoming available due to a combination of advances in pervasive computing, data acquisition systems as well as high performance computing. Integrated modeling and decision making environments are necessary to support planning, analysis and counter factual experiments to study these complex systems. Here, we describe SIMFRASTRUCTURE - a flexible coordination middleware that supports high performance computing oriented decision and analytics environments to study socially coupled systems. Simfrastructure provides a multiplexing mechanism by which simple and intuitive user-interfaces can be plugged in as front-end systems, and high-end computing resources can be plugged in as back-end systems for execution. This makes the computational complexity of the simulations completely transparent to the users. The decoupling of user interfaces and data repository from simulation execution allows users to access simulation results asynchronously and enables them to add new datasets and simulation models dynamically. Simfrastructure enables implementation of a simple yet powerful modeling environment with built-in analytics-as-a service platform, which provides seamless access to high end computational resources, through an intuitive interface for studying socially coupled systems. We illustrate the applicability of Simfrastructure in the context of an integrated modeling environment to study public health epidemiology.","","978-0-7695-4996-5","10.1109/CCGrid.2013.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546132","Socially coupled systems;middleware;public health epidemiology;distributed systems;software architecture","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data models;Libraries;Data transfer;Middleware;Analytical models","computational complexity;data acquisition;decision making;digital simulation;health care;middleware;parallel processing;socio-economic effects;ubiquitous computing;user interfaces","Simfrastructure;flexible middleware platform;adaptable middleware platform;socially coupled system modeling;socially coupled system analysis;interdependent networks;social networks;organizational networks;economic networks;infrastructure networks;physical networks;pervasive computing;data acquisition systems;high performance computing;decision making;integrated modeling environments;flexible coordination middleware;multiplexing mechanism;intuitive user interfaces;front-end systems;high-end computing resources;back-end systems;computational complexity;data repository;simulation execution;built-in analytics-as-a-service platform;high end computational resource access;public health epidemiology","","3","","24","","24 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.01CH37240)","7 Aug 2002","2001","9","","2860","2864 vol.9","Current literature on input buffer management reveals that, in representative ATM networks under highly bursty traffic conditions, the fuzzy thresholding approach yields lower cell loss rate at the cost of lower throughput. Also, under less bursty traffic, the traditional fixed thresholding approach achieves higher throughput at the expense of higher cell loss rate. The translation of this finding into practice, termed adaptive dynamic input buffer management (ADBM), is the objective of this paper. The argument is that, given that the traffic conditions are constantly changing, to achieve efficiency during actual operation, the network control must dynamically switch, at every ATM switch, under the call processor's control, between the two input buffer management techniques, dictated by the nature of the traffic at the inputs of the corresponding switch. In order to best characterize the nature of the incoming traffic, the ADBM technique relies on the use of a counter and a choice of a time interval. The counter best determines the burstiness nature of the input traffic by counting the number of cells that are intercepted at the input of the switch over a defined time interval. The challenge posed by this proposition lies in the very definition of burstiness in that the time interval must approach, in the limit, zero or the resolution of time in the network. To address this challenge, a 15-node representative ATM network is modeled in an asynchronous, distributed simulator and, simulated on a network of workstations under realistic traffic stimuli. Burstiness indices are measured for the synthetic, stochastic traffic at the inputs of every ATM switch as a function of the progress of simulation for different choices of time interval values. Simulation results reveal superior performance for ADBM, with a throughput of 74.77% that is higher than even the pure fixed scheme, and cell drop rate of 2.21% that is lower than that of the pure fuzzy scheme. In essence, ADBM successfully integrates the best characteristics of the fuzzy and fixed thresholding schemes.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.936672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=936672","","Switches;Asynchronous transfer mode;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Communication system traffic control;Counting circuits;Traffic control;Costs;Process control;Workstations","asynchronous transfer mode;buffer storage;adaptive systems;telecommunication control;digital simulation;telecommunication traffic;telecommunication computing;workstation clusters","adaptive dynamic buffer management;input buffers;ATM networks;bursty traffic conditions;fuzzy thresholding;cell loss rate;throughput;fixed thresholding;traffic conditions;network control;ATM switch;call processor control;counter;time interval;asynchronous distributed simulator;network of workstations;synthetic stochastic traffic;simulation results;cell drop rate","","","","9","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, the traffic adjustment is much finer than existing multicast protocols of single-layer granularity. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed scheme significantly improves the amount of delivered traffic and the end-to-end delay by as much as 10%, as compared to layer-wise adjustment. Moreover, it does not require one to maintain multiple sessions for transferring multi-layer data but only one session, and thus reduces the overheads on session management and network bandwidth.","1526-7539","0-7695-0728-X","10.1109/MASCOT.2000.876555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=876555","","Traffic control;Intelligent networks;Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Internet;Multicast protocols;Computer simulation;Delay;Multimedia systems;Telecommunication traffic","active networks;telecommunication traffic;telecommunication congestion control;multimedia communication;multicast communication;receivers;telecommunication network routing;digital simulation;telecommunication computing;delays;telecommunication network management;control system analysis computing","active traffic control mechanism;layered multimedia multicasting;ATLM scheme;active network environment;multicasting multimedia data;heterogeneous receiver adaptation;routers;immediate children nodes;traffic adjustment;multicast protocols;computer simulation;granularity;end-to-end delay;session maintenance;multi-layer data transfer;session management overhead;network bandwidth overheads;congestion","","3","2","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motorola's GPS receivers have been used for time synchronization and frequency control for several years. Motorola has introduced the next generation of GPS receivers for precise timing, which feature improved performance and lower cost. Typically, the precise pulse from a GPS receiver is used to discipline a higher precision crystal or rubidium oscillator so that it can be synchronized to a common time stamp. The pulse stability from the GPS receiver is important in the disciplining process. The pulse is also used to synchronize the system to UTC, so the absolute accuracy of the precise pulse is of interest. Most precision timing applications are at fixed base station sites. In the case of wireless telecommunications applications, many of the sites where the GPS receiver is installed are shared with other RF antennas. The GPS signal can be jammed by various RF emitters at certain frequencies and power levels. For a GPS receiver to operate under these conditions, it must be able to track the GPS signal in the presence of in-band and out-of-band interference. The new UT Oncore/sup TM/ has been tested against UTC time standards for accuracy and atomic standards for stability. This paper outlines the tests performed and the results of these tests are compared with previous generation receivers. Other performance aspects of the GPS receiver including immunity to interference signals and startup time are also presented.","","0-7803-3728-X","10.1109/FREQ.1997.638564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=638564","","Testing;Costs;Global Positioning System;Timing;Frequency synchronization;Stability;Radio frequency;Interference;Frequency control;Oscillators","Global Positioning System;radio receivers;time measurement;synchronisation;jamming;measurement standards;telecommunication equipment testing;digital simulation;simulation;economics;telecommunication computing;signal processing","GPS receiver;time transfer applications;Precise timing;Global Positioning System;worldwide continuous precise time transfer;cost;Motorola;time synchronization;frequency control;rubidium oscillator;time stamp;pulse stability;absolute accuracy;wireless telecommunications applications;GPS signal;UT Oncore;interference signals;startup time;filtering;adaptive tracking;DoD","","11","11","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a combined driver model consisting of a compensatory transfer function and an anticipatory component based on road geometry is integrated with the design of the individual driver's desired path. The proposed driver model parameters are obtained from human subject test data collected in a driving simulator. It has been shown that the proposed combined driver model is able to replicate each driver's steering wheel angle signals for a variety of maneuvers at different vehicle speeds. The driver model is then validated by first using a polynomial to interpolate the driver model and desired path parameters for an intermediate speed. It is also validated by comparing two different drivers' model parameter sets to show that each driver has a unique set of parameters. The final validation is to show that the proposed individual driver's desired path offers more accurate steering wheel fits than the previous geometric centerline.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2529582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426402","Desired path generation;driver model;steering","Vehicles;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Wheels;Predictive models;Trajectory","behavioural sciences computing;digital simulation;driver information systems;polynomials;road safety;road vehicles;steering systems","driver steering model;personalized desired path generation;driver assistance systems;vehicle control;driving safety;human driving behavior prediction;combined driver model;compensatory transfer function;anticipatory component;road geometry;individual driver desired path design;driver model parameters;human subject test data;driving simulator;driver steering wheel angle signals;vehicle speeds;polynomial;intermediate speed","","47","","40","","4 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One approach of tackling the problem is the usage of dedicated hardware, optimized towards the corresponding algorithm, together with a DSP. However this may cause overhead in data transfers (DSP <-> ASIC) and requires additional control hardware and memories. The full design process including simulation and debugging of the whole system can be very time consuming.

Several factors constrain the development of a true intelligent autonomous machine. The acquisition of expert knowledge continues to hinder progress. Knowledge acquisition techniques have reduced the effort involved in acquiring knowledge from an expert and representing it in a form that can be used by the computer. Most, however, focus on the gathering and representation of one class of knowledge. Two major categories of expertise makeup most of the expert's knowledge: explicit knowledge which is easy to articulate, and implicit knowledge such as intuition and judgment. It is in the nature of implicit knowledge that makes it difficult to clearly define and acquire from experts. Most current approaches learn only the expert explicit knowledge via query sessions and ignore the implicit expertise altogether. Humans, on the other hand, continually learn and apply both types of knowledge. Humans typically learn the implicit knowledge by observing others handle real-life situations and by adapting what they observed to handle new situations. This research aims to answer the following question: How does one implement learning by observation such that implicit knowledge can be acquired, represented, and reused? It focuses on capturing and modeling the implicit knowledge that is commonly applied by experts while they deal with dynamic real-life situations. The paper explains the formulated approach and discusses the results obtained from its application to the driving domain.","","0-7803-2559-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1995.538146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=538146","","Object oriented modeling;Knowledge engineering;Machine intelligence;Artificial intelligence;Knowledge acquisition;Humans;Intelligent systems;Knowledge transfer;Expert systems;Data mining","knowledge acquisition;object-oriented methods;digital simulation","IASKNOT;simulation-based object-oriented framework;implicit expert knowledge acquisition;human intelligence;true intelligent autonomous machine;real-life situations;learning by observation","","","1","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure this, fault effect simulation by simulation-based fault injection is an integral part of embedded system development. The high complexity of embedded systems results in low simulation performance if all details of the system are simulated. Not simulating all details, i.e. increasing the simulation abstraction level, speeds up fault injection but can result in less accuracy in predicting the fault impacts on the system behavior. To achieve high accuracy and high simulation performance at the same time, we avoid simulation of details unrelated to the injected fault. For this, we divide the set of faults that can occur in an embedded system into three subsets. For each subset, we select the fault injection abstraction level of the embedded processor model that is as accurate as necessary but as fast as possible. The considered levels are host-compiled simulation, instruction set simulation and register transfer level simulation. For additional speed-up, the abstraction level can be switched during the fault injection simulation between register transfer and instruction set level. The fault set for host-compiled simulation can be reduced by static program analysis. Our results show that adapting the abstraction level to the fault set achieves high performance of the fault injection simulation.","1942-9401","978-1-5386-5992-2","10.1109/IOLTS.2018.8474079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8474079","Fault injection;fault effect simulation;abstraction level;host-compiled simulation;instruction set simulation;register transfer level","Instruction sets;Registers;Embedded systems;Adaptation models;Pipelines;Latches","digital simulation;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;fault diagnosis;instruction sets;program compilers;program diagnostics","efficient fault injection;random hardware faults;simulation-based fault injection;embedded system development;low simulation performance;simulation abstraction level;system behavior;high simulation performance;injected fault;fault injection abstraction level;embedded processor model;host-compiled simulation;register transfer level simulation;fault injection simulation;fault effect simulation;instruction set simulation","","","","14","","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, the performance of software-based simulation is vastly inadequate to achieve sufficient coverage for large microprocessor designs with complex microarchitectures. Hence, acceleration and emulation platforms are heavily deployed in the industry for high-performance validation. However, software checkers cannot be directly incorporated into such platforms, forcing designers to craft ad-hoc solutions. Adapting checking solutions for software simulation to acceleration platforms presents the following constraints: i) only a limited number of signals can be monitored per cycle for checking purposes so as to retain acceptable simulation performance, and ii) the overhead of the added checking logic must be minimal. In this work, we explore a novel solution to adapt software-based checkers for individual microarchitectural blocks to acceleration platforms, by leveraging a hybrid approach. Our solution exploits embedded logic and data tracing for post-simulation checking in a synergistic fashion to limit the associated overhead. Embedded logic can be used for synthesized local checkers as well as to compress the traced data and thus limit recording overhead. We analyze several trade-offs associated with checking accuracy and logic / recording overhead for different microarchitectural blocks of an out-of-order superscalar processor design. We strive to provide valuable insights on how to adapt such software checkers to the acceleration environment using our hybrid approach. We find that, by leveraging simple embedded checkers and data compressors (15-25% logic overhead), we can achieve excellent checking accuracy even when aggressively compressing the data for transfer (only 15-25 bits/cycle), and localize bugs up to 5,900 cycles sooner than an architectural-level checker.","1558-2434","978-1-4799-1071-7","10.1109/ICCAD.2013.6691137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691137","","Microarchitecture;Acceleration;Adaptation models;Out of order;Data models;Microprocessors","data compression;digital simulation;electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;logic circuits;microprocessor chips","hybrid checking;microarchitectural validation;acceleration platforms;microprocessor design validation;software-based simulation;high-performance validation;ad-hoc solutions;checking solutions;software simulation;added checking logic;software-based checkers;microarchitectural blocks;synergistic fashion;data tracing;embedded logic;post-simulation checking;synthesized local checkers;out-of-order superscalar processor design;data compressors;bug localization;architectural-level checker","","1","","17","","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LCN'99","6 Aug 2002","1999","","","80","87","In wireless ATM networks, user connections need to be rerouted during handoff as mobile users move among base stations. The rerouting of connections must be done quickly with minimal disruption to traffic. In addition, the resulting routes must be optimal. A reasonable approach is to implement handoff in two phases. In the first phase connections are rapidly rerouted and in the second phase a periodic route optimization procedure is executed. The route optimization should impose minimal signaling and processing load on the ATM switches. In this paper, we propose and study a periodic execution of route optimization for a two-phase handoff scheme. We study two types of execution: non-adaptive and adaptive. For the adaptive optimization, we consider two adaptation schemes that are dependent on network conditions. A simulation model is developed to study system performance. The adaptive route optimization is shown to minimize signaling and processing load while maximizing utilization of reserved resources.","0742-1303","0-7695-0309-8","10.1109/LCN.1999.802001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=802001","","Intelligent networks;Switches;Delay;Asynchronous transfer mode;Signal processing;Mobile communication;Computer networks;Electronic switching systems;Communications technology;Wireless communication","asynchronous transfer mode;packet radio networks;telecommunication traffic;telecommunication signalling;telecommunication network routing;optimisation;adaptive systems;queueing theory;cellular radio;digital simulation","wireless ATM networks;periodic route optimization;handed-off connections;user connections;base stations;minimal signaling load;minimal processing load;ATM switches;two-phase handoff scheme;nonadaptive route optimization;network conditions;simulation model;system performance;adaptive route optimization;cellular radio;M/M/1 queue;departure events;arrival events","","","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea is to use an adaptive controller that incorporates the concept of duality in the sense of Feldbaum (1965) and to consider the cost functional M-steps ahead in time. The dual property means that the control signal is chosen in such a way that estimation of the model parameters and regulation of the output signals are optimally balanced. Extensive computer simulations for different values of M shows that the sample mean of the achieved cost tends asymptotically to a limiting value while the variance is reduced. The proposed suboptimal adaptive controller has also an improved transient response when compared to a certainty equivalent controller.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.581942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581942","","Adaptive control;Blood pressure;Drugs;Programmable control;Pressure control;Parameter estimation;Delay effects;Control systems;Uncertainty;Transfer functions","haemodynamics;adaptive control;biocontrol;patient treatment;suboptimal control;digital simulation;physiological models","suboptimal dual adaptive control;blood pressure management;vasoactive drugs;extensive computer simulations;adaptive controller;transient response;certainty equivalent controller;functional M-steps;achieved cost;model parameters;output signals regulation;therapeutic technique","Antihypertensive Agents;Blood Pressure;Equipment Design;Humans;Hypertension;Infusion Pumps;Least-Squares Analysis;Models, Cardiovascular;Stochastic Processes","7","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such processing requires a computational capability which is effectively proportional to the square of the antenna size, and can readily become one of the main design drivers. This processing bottleneck problem is addressed for large phased array antennas. An approach in terms of parallel processing in the optical domain is presented as a potential solution. The defining equations for a phased array antenna system are given, along with the transfer functions for an embedded optical spatial filter control element. Such a control element is shown to have the potential of rapidly reconfiguring a large phased array antenna without the speed penalties associated with conventional sequential addressing methods. A hypothetical phased array antenna, with optical spatial filter control elements, is simulated in a computer model and performance results are presented.<>","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.55617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=55617","","Phased arrays;Optical arrays;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave antenna arrays;Antenna arrays;Optical filters;Optical control;Adaptive arrays;Radar antennas;Spatial filters","antenna phased arrays;digital simulation;microwave antenna arrays;spatial filters","array reconfiguration;microwave phased arrays;phased array antennas;parallel processing;optical domain;transfer functions;embedded optical spatial filter control element;computer model","","6","","21","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenges arise due to the volatile and sometimes, unpredictable nature of these networks. This is because, in a battlefield environment, the network elements (switches/routers) can appear and disappear sporadically, due to jamming, hostile attacks, etc. This results in sporadic changes in the network connectivity. Furthermore, mission re-assignments can occur and may also result in frequent traffic pattern shift. Thus an auto-configuration management system that can adapt to the dynamic network conditions is extremely important. In this work, we have designed an adaptive configuration management system (ACMS) that is sensitive to the battlefield dynamics. We use the concept of directory service systems to facilitate automated configuration management. We have also developed an initial design framework of a simulation model that can be used to demonstrate our ACMS design.","","0-7803-6521-6","10.1109/MILCOM.2000.904923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904923","","Adaptive systems;Switches;Asynchronous transfer mode;Decision support systems;Environmental management;Jamming;Network topology;Spine;Laboratories;Cities and towns","adaptive systems;telecommunication network management;military communication;configuration management;jamming;digital simulation;telecommunication network routing","adaptive configuration management architecture;tactical battlefield networks;network elements;switches;routers;jamming;hostile attacks;network connectivity;traffic pattern shift;auto-configuration management system;dynamic network conditions;adaptive configuration management system;directory service systems;automated configuration management;simulation model;ACMS design","","","","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A set of two-dimensional computational (finite element) models was developed In order to test the effect of various screw profiles on the predicted extent of bone resorption. An algorithm simulating local bone adaptation to mechanical stimuli was developed and subsequently used to evaluate the biomechanical performances of the different screw profiles analyzed, i.e., triangular, rectangular and trapezoidal thread shapes. This remodeling algorithm predicted local bone gain or loss in the vicinity of the screw as a response to the mechanical stress distribution. A dimensionless set of stress intensity parameters (SIP) was developed to quantify the bone-screw stress transfer, enabling a convenient rating of different screw performances according to the nature of expected adaptation of the surrounding bone. The results indicated that a wide rectangular screw profile is of superior biomechanical compatibility with bone compared to the other profile types. The present work demonstrated that bone remodeling computer simulations can be used as a powerful tool for evaluation of different design parameters of fixative screws, such as geometry, material characteristics and even coatings.","1094-687X","0-7803-7211-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2001.1020488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020488","","Cancellous bone;Orthopedic surgery;Implants;Fasteners;Stress;Computational modeling;Finite element methods;Predictive models;Testing;Analytical models","bone;biomechanics;orthopaedics;finite element analysis;digital simulation;medical computing;orthotics","cancellous bone resorption;orthopaedic fixative implants;dynamic simulations;bone fixation screws;progressive loosening;stress shielding;adaptive bone remodeling;bone loss;two-dimensional computational models;finite element models;screw profiles;bone resorption;remodeling algorithm;local bone gain;local bone loss;local bone adaptation;mechanical stimuli;biomechanical performances;triangular thread shapes;rectangular thread shapes;trapezoidal thread shapes;mechanical stress distribution;dimensionless set;stress intensity parameters;bone-screw stress transfer;biomechanical compatibility;design parameters;geometry;material characteristics;coatings","","1","","4","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to that, we propose a framework which builds on the concepts of data-enrichment of the domain simulation, a higher level descriptive definition and characterisation of different views and a query-based assembling mechanism for generating a specific view, thus automating the process of view generation. The implementation of this framework is achieved through the ADVISE (Adaptive Visual Simulation Environment) prototype system.

In this paper, we transfer air combat agents with experience fighting in 2-versus-1 scenarios to various 2-versus-2 scenarios. The performance of the transferred agents is compared to that of agents that learn from scratch in the 2v2 scenarios. The experiments show that the experience gained in the 2v1 scenarios is very beneficial in the plain 2v2 scenarios, where further learning is minimal. In difficult 2v2 scenarios transfer also occurs, and further learning ensues.

These things will help the proper routing and protection of data elements traversing the networks. Currently, network service providers (NSPs) use TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) extensively. The NSPs focus the delivery of hybrid services and features such as voice over IP (VOIP), and virtual private networks (VPNs), over single or multiple IP connections. For network-based applications to be efficient and effective, they must have adequate quality of service (QoS) support and guarantees. User level QoS violations are events, which can be described using traditional rare-event reliability and availability network models. Network parameters such as: the performance matrices, end to end congestion, network delay, average download response times, throughput blocking probabilities, and packet loss rates, should be modeled successfully to implement QoS. The authors have developed an operating model for a practical wide area network using industry standard tools such as OPNET Modeler. In addition, the network modeling schemes available from the UNIX and windows platforms have been analyzed and the corresponding results are compared for the modeling accuracy and integration. The authors present the parameters for the dynamic service delivery on a unified network core using network modeling schemes.

Therefore, their use in complex canopies implies complicated adaptations as well as simplifying assumptions that are difficult to validate. Alternatively, the ARCHIMED simulation platform uses 3D virtual stands as a support for numerical simulations of biophysical processes such as leaf irradiation, transpiration and temperature and ultimately carbon assimilation. By doing so, detailed information can be integrated from the individual leaf scale up to the individual plant scale, even within complex stands such as agroforestry systems. Simple numerical methods are used for solving multiple feedbacks between light, energy, water and CO2 transfers at leaf, plant and plot scales. Numerical calculations applied at different scales allow simple implementation of complex models involving intricate processes.","","978-0-7695-2851-9","10.1109/PMA.2006.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4548355","","Temperature;Feedback;Joining processes;Visualization;Vegetation;Numerical simulation;Chemical elements;Input variables;Wind speed;Humidity","digital simulation;ecology;forestry;geophysics computing;solid modelling;vegetation","ecophysiological process simulation;3D virtual stand;ARCHIMED simulation platform;canopy representation;vegetation layer;numerical simulation;biophysical process;leaf irradiation;transpiration;temperature;carbon assimilation;agroforestry systems","","1","","25","","24 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An adaptive fuzzy logic controller designed to control the swing phase of paraplegic gait was trained on a computer model using reinforcement learning. Instead of starting from scratch with generic fuzzy rules, the controller was jump-started in two different ways with experienced rules. First, supervised learning was used to initially train the controller, then two system parameters were altered and the reinforcement learning algorithm proceeded to find an optimal solution. This required a total of 34 simulation cycles. The same task, using reinforcement learning alone, required almost 150 cycles. Second, the trained controller was transferred to two individuals of differing body mass and height. It required less than 20 additional cycles to converge in both cases. By placing the controller initially closer to an optimal solution, jump-starting greatly reduces the number of simulation cycles required.","1094-687X","0-7803-4262-3","10.1109/IEMBS.1997.757070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=757070","","Acceleration;Control systems;Hip;Optimal control;Automatic control;Muscles;Knee;Supervised learning;Electrodes;Legged locomotion","fuzzy control;biocontrol;neuromuscular stimulation;adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);controllers;digital simulation;physiological models;biomechanics;bioelectric phenomena","FES control;learning rate acceleration;adaptive fuzzy logic controller;paraplegic gait swing phase control;body mass;height;optimal solution;simulation cycles;generic fuzzy rules;supervised learning;functional electrical stimulation;experienced rules;computer model;system parameters;reinforcement learning algorithm","","1","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach is based upon signal processing techniques and a priori knowledge of the system transfer function. The first step is to measure the phase response of the linear transfer function and then using a FIR filter the time response of the system can be determined. The FIR filter computes the time response by performing a deconvolution between the measured phase response, and the complex conjugate of the transfer function. By correlating the known input impulse response with the output of the FIR filter, an error term is generated. The time delay of the system is determined by adjusting the FIR filter coefficients to minimize the error term.

We have approached the dimensioning of this interface from the perspective of simulation, concretely for the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) access network. We have developed a simulation model capable of representing multi-service scenarios inside this particular UTMS interface. This tool can be fed with traffic of different types, representing the different traffic classes defined for UMTS, and is able to simulate traffic differentiation both at the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and the AAL2 (ATM Adaptation Layer 2) level.

This paper presents an API in AIMSUN, which is a stochastic and microscopic simulation model, to evaluate a novel real-time signal control technique based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. A transportation network of diamond interchanges is first created and calibrated in the AIMSUN environment. The API, which creates a dynamic link between the DP algorithm and AIMSUN, is then developed and deployed in C++. During simulation runtime, real-time traffic measurements, including vehicle counts and speeds, are provided by detectors in the network and fed into the DP algorithm that subsequently makes a decision on a signal control plan. The signal plan is then transferred back to and implemented in the simulated network, which emulates its actual operation. Extensive simulations have shown that the new signal control technique is superior to other common offline signal optimization tools in terms of handling the demand fluctuations. This paper has demonstrated that the API function is a useful tool to assess new ITS applications that are unavailable in simulation programs.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2008.2006770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4667672","Adaptive control;adaptive systems;application programming interface;intelligent systems;real time systems;simulation;traffic control (transportation);transportation;Adaptive control;adaptive systems;application programming interface;intelligent systems;real time systems;simulation;traffic control (transportation);transportation","Microscopy;Traffic control;Intelligent transportation systems;Vehicle driving;Intelligent vehicles;Stochastic processes;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Runtime","application program interfaces;C++ language;control engineering computing;digital simulation;dynamic programming;traffic control;traffic engineering computing","capability-enhanced microscopic simulation;real-time traffic signal control;application programming interface;traffic simulation programs;intelligent transportation systems;dynamic programming;C++","","16","","21","","7 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our mechanism is suitable for resource discovery as well as routing very small data transfers or transactions in which the cost of data transfer is much smaller than the cost of route discovery. Our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding or complex hierarchy formation and does not require any location information. In CARD resources within the vicinity of a node, up to a limited number of hops, are discovered using a proactive scheme. For resources beyond the vicinity, each node maintains a few distant nodes called contacts. Contacts help in creating a small world in the network and provide an efficient way to query for distant resources. As the number of contacts of increases, the network view (reachability) of the node also increases, increasing the discovery success rate. Paths to contacts are validated periodically to adapt to mobility. We present mechanisms for contact selection and maintenance that attempt to increase reachability with reduced overhead. Our simulation results show that CARD can be configured to provide desirable performance for various network sizes. Comparisons with other schemes show overhead savings reaching 87% (vs. flooding) and 79% (vs. bordercasting) for high query rates in large-scale networks.","1530-2075","0-7695-1926-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213401","","Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Ad hoc networks;Costs;Routing;Network servers;Temperature sensors;Engineering profession;Wireless networks;Centralized control","ad hoc networks;digital simulation;radio access networks","contact-based architecture;resource discovery;large scale MANets;global flooding;complex hierarchy formation;simulation results;large-scale networks","","24","","19","","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The probability density function of the interarrival time of the ATM adaptation layer 5 (AAL5) protocol data unit (PDU) is derived from an MPEG-2 video source model and an ATM network jitter model. Based on a real-time decoding requirement of the MPEG-2 transport stream (TS) system target decoder (T-STD), the decoder buffer behaviour is simulated. In this simulation, the packets' arrivals follow the derived probability density function of the AAL5 PDU interarrival time.

No.98CH36201)","6 Aug 2002","1998","1","","277","281 vol.1","This paper describes the design and performance of a new adaptive FEC scheme (Yurie FEC) for wireless ATM. The wireless channel is characterized by higher error rates and burstier error patterns in comparison with fiber-based links for which ATM was designed initially. The purpose of the Yurie FEC scheme is to provide a capability to dynamically support ATM-based communications over noisy wireless channels. The Yurie FEC scheme is based on Reed-Solomon coding to protect the ATM cell payload and payload type indicator/cell loss priority (PTI/CLP) fields in the ATM header. In order to enhance error tolerance in terms of framing and correct delivery, the Yurie FEC scheme functions within the existing LANET framing and addressing protection protocols. The proposed Yurie FEC scheme has been validated using a software emulator based on the simulation setup for an ATM network with low-speed wireless links. From the simulation results, the performance of the Yurie FEC scheme agrees with the benchmark results using a random BER injector when the wireless terminal is stationary. At the channel BER of 10/sup -3/, the final BER after FEC correction is about 10/sup -6/, low enough for TCP/IP operation.","","0-7803-4506-1","10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=722585","","Forward error correction;Bit error rate;Protection;Payloads;Error analysis;Optical fiber communication;Wireless communication;Reed-Solomon codes;Error correction;Protocols","asynchronous transfer mode;packet radio networks;adaptive codes;forward error correction;telecommunication channels;error statistics;transport protocols;Reed-Solomon codes;digital simulation","adaptive FEC;wireless ATM networks;Yurie FEC;Reed-Solomon coding;error rates;bursty error patterns;fiber-based links;noisy wireless channels;ATM cell payload;PTI/CLP fields;ATM header;error tolerance;payload type indicator;LANET framing protocol;LANET addressing protection protocol;software emulator;simulation setup;low-speed wireless links;simulation results;benchmark results;random BER injector;stationary wireless terminal;TCP/IP operation;cell loss priority","","5","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The BP algorithms use the delay tolerance of applications to batch requests in time slots. Bandwidth assignment is made either at the end of the slot, or during the slot, on a priority basis. Analytical and simulation models are developed to quantify the performance of the BP schemes. The results are compared with those obtained for a first-come-first-served (FCFS) service discipline. In a system with applications requiring multiple transmission rates, the class of BP schemes trade-off the delay and loss tolerance of applications to improve the net carried traffic on the link. Further, such schemes enable an easy implementation for adaptive prioritization, where the degree of precedence given to an application varies with offered load and the link capacity.","1091-8442","0-7803-5106-1","10.1109/ICUPC.1998.732843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=732843","","Admission control;Bandwidth;Quality of service;Traffic control;Throughput;Delay effects;Analytical models;Asynchronous transfer mode;Telecommunication traffic;Laboratories","telecommunication congestion control;multimedia communication;radio links;queueing theory;delays;quality of service;bandwidth allocation;digital simulation;data communication;land mobile radio;telecommunication traffic","priority based link-bandwidth partitioning;multi-rate wireless systems;wireless multimedia services;QoS;delay;throughput;batch and prioritize;service disciplines;BP admission control;BP algorithms;delay tolerance;time slots;bandwidth assignment;simulation models;analytical models;performance;first-come-first-served;FCFS service discipline;multiple transmission rates;loss tolerance;net carried traffic;adaptive prioritization;offered load;link capacity;high speed data;Markov chain analysis;mobile radio","","12","2","6","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increased computing resources required for large-scale network simulation, one GPU device may not have enough memory and computation capacities. It is therefore necessary to enhance the system scalability by introducing multiple GPU devices. It is also attractive to investigate the performance scalability of Multi-GPU simulations. This paper describes the simulation of information propagation on multiple GPU devices, including the optimized network simulation algorithms, the network partitioning and replication strategy, and the data synchronization scheme. The experimental results for scalable random networks show that the number of simulation steps, computation time, synchronization time, and data transfer time all affect the overall simulation performance. In order to compare with random networks, we also conduct simulations of scale-free networks. We can observe that the node replication ratio in scale-free networks is smaller than that in random networks and therefore the cost of data transfer and synchronization is significantly reduced. This indicates that the network structure is also an important factor that influences the simulation performance in a Multi-GPU system.","1550-6525","978-0-7695-5138-8","10.1109/DS-RT.2013.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690508","Information Propagation;Multi-GPU;Distributed Simulation;Performance Analysis","Graphics processing units;Synchronization;Computational modeling;Performance evaluation;Adaptation models;Data models;Complex networks","digital simulation;graphics processing units;performance evaluation","information propagation simulation;complex networks;general purpose graphics processing units;high performance computing platforms;GPU device;performance scalability;Multi-GPU simulations;data synchronization scheme;scale-free networks","","2","","19","","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rapid expansion of MCMs will depend on several economical and technical factors. One of the most important requirements is the availability of high accuracy computational tools for electrical, mechanical and thermal design of MCMs. This paper presents a novel concept of a Virtual Prototyping Environment (VPE) for multi-scale, multi-disciplinary simulations of electronics packaging of MCMs and their assemblies. The VPE incorporates a visual framework for interfacing simulation tools for geometric modeling, automated meshing, thermal simulation, thermal stress/structures analysis, material database, on-line visualization and dynamic steering. A novel, compact data format is proposed for detailed thermo-mechanical description of dies, interconnects, MCMs, PCB and entire systems. A visual browser and ""virtual assembler"" of MCMs have been developed allowing rapid prototyping of electronics modules with high fidelity simulation tools.

Processing elements (PEs) connect to a communication topology via NoC switches, which are responsible for runtime establishment and management of inter-PE communication channels. Since NoC switch design directly affects overall system performance and exploited communication parallelism, much previous work focused on efficient NoC switch design. In this paper, we present MACS-a highly parametric NoC switch architecture that provides reduced data transfer latency, increased designer flexibility, and scalability as compared to previous architectures by combining and enhancing several NoC design strategies. MACS enhances inter-PE communication using a circuit switching technique with minimal adaptive routing and a simple and fair path resolution algorithm to maximize bandwidth utilization. We evaluate area and performance of an FPGA implementation of MACS, and, show that compared to previous work, MACS offers a 2× to 7× decrease in average channel setup latency, a 1.7× to 2× reduction in area requirements, similar average packet latency, up to a 6× increase in the network saturation point, and up to a 1.4× increase in bandwidth utilization. Additionally, we illustrate MACS's low average channel setup latency using six network traffic patterns and eight parallel JPEG decompression core trace simulations.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2015.2390631","National Science Foundation; NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006979","Network-on-chip;minimal adaptive;distributed round-robin;FPGA;Network-on-chip;minimal adaptive;distributed round-robin;FPGA","Ports (Computers);Bandwidth;Routing;Switching circuits;Communication channels;Switches;Topology","circuit switching;digital simulation;field programmable gate arrays;image coding;integrated circuit design;network routing;network-on-chip;parallel processing;VLSI","parallel JPEG decompression core trace simulation;network traffic pattern;network saturation point;average packet latency;average channel setup latency;FPGA implementation;bandwidth utilization maximization;fair path resolution algorithm;minimal adaptive routing;circuit switching technique;data transfer latency reduction;communication parallelism;NoC switch design;interPE communication channel;communication topology;processing elements;single chip VLSI design;network-on-chip;highly customizable low-latency communication architecture;MACS","","4","","37","","12 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

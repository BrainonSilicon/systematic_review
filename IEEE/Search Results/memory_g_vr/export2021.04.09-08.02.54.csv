"Automobility: the coming use of fully-automated on-road vehicles","P. A. Hancock","Department of Psychology, Institute for Simulation & Training, University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA","2015 IEEE International Multi-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision","18 May 2015","2015","","","137","139","In a world that appears primarily to be motivated by a worship of the false idol of profit, there can be little doubt that the era of automated road vehicles is upon us. Indeed, such technologies have already begun to percolate into the bespoke vehicle domain and what becomes feasible in the special case is a prime candidate to penetrate into the more general circumstance. Within a period of mere decades, will it be the case that we will look back upon the manually controlled vehicle in the same manner that we now look upon the manually operated elevator, as a piquant anachronism or the particular domain of a specialized segment of the antiques trade? But, before we achieve even the first degree of true “automobility” we shall have to pass through a hybrid stage of development in which the role of the individual human driver will have to evolve substantively. During this phase of evolution, the population of vehicles on the road will be best described as `mixed equipage' (i.e., dynamically changing combinations of automated and manually controlled vehicles). Whether such differing capacity vehicles will be separated in either space (e.g., lanes devoted to automatic vehicles) or time (e.g., blocks of time when only manual vehicles are permitted on a specific roadway), is a question which must concern all who attend this important inception. If differing capacity vehicles are allowed to `mix,' a critical element of acceptance for example, will be how automated vehicles deal with drowsy, fatigued, or otherwise impaired drivers exercising traditional manual control. After exploring this specific strand of hybrid development and innovative forms of vehicle control from a human factors perspective, and briefly considering the parallel development of diverse robotic systems, I conclude my present discourse by asking the provocative question which may be expressed as follows. While we can develop such automated systems, should we in fact pursue this line of development? The latter questions are intimately bound up in the notions of safety, efficiency, choice, freedom, and our prospective overall social and individual quality of life. Whether these latter questions ever enter into the primary scientific and engineering discourse about the coming technological wave of automation I considered rather doubtful.","2379-1675","978-1-4799-8015-4","10.1109/COGSIMA.2015.7108188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108188","automated road vehicles;automobility;trust","Robot sensing systems;Visualization;Resource management;Social network services;Read only memory;Cognitive science","human factors;road vehicles","fully-automated on-road vehicles;bespoke vehicle domain;manually controlled vehicle;automobility degree;vehicle control;human factors perspective;diverse robotic systems","","8","","9","","18 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A concept map approach for introduction to Computer Engineering course curriculum","G. Tokdemir; N. E.

The topics toughed in this course can be grouped into two. The first group includes simple concepts like binary numbering system, hard disk, memory, and I/O devices. In the second group, an introduction to the courses that they will take in the next semesters of the program which includes programming, networking, software engineering, artificial intelligence and database systems. The main objective of this course is to give an introduction about the general concepts of the field to the first year Computer Engineering students and prepare them to understand the connections between them for their future studies. However, students and instructors face with many problems in this course. First, because of the diversity of the concepts given in the course, it is very difficult for the students to see the big picture of the Computer Engineering domain. Similarly, it is difficult for the instructors to prepare the course content in an integrated manner at the students' level. Additionally, the perception of the theory and practice behind the hardware and software topics and their connections is not an easy task for the beginners. Moreover, the topics are mostly abstract topics, which do not allow application of any laboratory sessions. Students usually find this course difficult to understand, which decreases their motivation about the department and success of the course. This study is established to propose a concept map approach to better visualize and discover all the connections between the concepts of Computer Engineering field which can be used in the curriculum of the programs and introductory courses of the field addressing the above problems. The proposed concept map helps to visualize the general picture of the field.","2165-9567","978-1-4244-6571-2","10.1109/EDUCON.2010.5492570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492570","curriculum development;concept maps;computer engineering","Fiber reinforced plastics;Virtual reality;Optical computing;Visualization;Hard disks;Software engineering;Artificial intelligence;Database systems;Engineering students;Hardware","computer science education;educational administrative data processing;educational courses","computer engineering course;hardware topic;software topic;concept map approach;introductory course;programs course","","2","","","","24 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the first phase of study, we have developed a preliminary reconstructed 3D model of Sompur Mahaviahara - as `professional interpretation'. But this attempt was hindered due to non-availability of substantial resources. At the same time we have found it almost impossible to depend solely on materials that are available at first hand to demonstrate a continuous narrative of this monument. This leads us to a second phase of study which attempts to collect and investigate `public interpretation' of the same monument. We propose a novel approach of heritage interpretation for general people, opposing the traditional interpretation method. We have developed an interactive web-portal, where active online participants can collaborate and collectively generate a knowledge base of cultural memories. We hope through this participatory approach of reconstruction/interpretation will provide an understanding of public view about this monument and at the same time will generate a popular database which can later support our previous study to get a clearer picture of the past glory of Sompur Mahavihara. As a methodology `heritage interpretation' is first conceptualized; followed by elaboration of professional interpretation.

Focusing on modes of interaction in this work, we examined the effect of different motion types on the knowledge acquisition of users in various virtual environments. For our study we chose a simple memorization task as approximation of low cognitive knowledge acquirement. We hypothesized motion types and immersion levels influence memorization performance in virtual environments. The memorization task was conducted in two virtual environments with different levels of immersion: A high-immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a low-immersive desktop virtual environment. Two motion types in virtual environments were explored: Physical and virtual walking. In the CAVE physical walking was implemented by using motion capturing and virtual walking was realized using a joystick-like input device. The results indicate neither motion types nor immersion levels in virtual environments affect memorization performance significantly.","2377-9322","978-1-4673-4703-7","10.1109/CIVEMSA.2013.6617404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617404","cognition;human computer interaction;learning;memory;motion;virtual environment;virtual reality","Virtual environments;Navigation;Legged locomotion;Tutorials;Stereo vision;Educational institutions","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;human factors;interactive devices;virtual reality","training;education;CAVE physical walking;virtual walking;low-immersive desktop virtual environment;high-immersive CAVE automatic virtual environment;hypothesized motion types;cognitive knowledge acquirement;user knowledge acquisition;virtual learning environments;user process;virtual environment design;training purposes;memorization performance","","4","","12","","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are plenty of educational, cognitive, architectural and neuroscience theories suggesting that certain environmental aspects can enhance the learning process. Such an example is the variation of lighting conditions, in terms of intensity (high or low luminance) and/or temperature (cold or warm), that have been shown to improve memory, attention and executive functions. In this paper, we investigate the differences between a real and a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) regarding the effects of the lighting conditions on several cognitive functions while we apply, for the first time, certain lighting theories directly into a University level VLE. The first main outcome of our study is that lighting conditions in VLEs affect students' cognitive functions in a similar way to traditional/physical learning environments, i.e. high luminance enhance memory, attention and executive functions when compared with low luminance. Our results indicate that if we need to test a cognitive or learning hypothesis, we can test it directly into a virtual environment since it gives us similar results/outcomes with those triggered in real one. Moreover, our results demonstrate that exposure to blue (cold) lighting in VLEs increase students' scores, in the given pseudoword test, in comparison with their exposure to red (warm) lighting.","","978-0-7381-2346-2","10.1109/IISA50023.2020.9284416","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation; General Secretariat for Research and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284416","virtual learning environment;lighting conditions;color temperature;memory test;executive task;real environments","Neuroscience;Education;Lighting;Virtual environments;Task analysis","cognition;computer aided instruction;virtual reality","virtual learning environments;red lighting;blue lighting;virtual environment;lighting theories;cognitive functions;virtual learning environment;lighting conditions;learning process;architectural neuroscience theories;cognitive neuroscience theories;educational neuroscience theories;virtual reality;lighting variations","","","","25","","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with exploring an environment with general 2D map, the user can view the environment more realistically in an immersive manner. Here, an intensive map of environment with huge amount of point clouds, which is generated by employing the RTAB-Map SLAM with RGB-D cameras, is utilized to provide a more complete observation to the user than that of the sparse map. Since the memory of a mobile phone is limited and smaller than a personal computer, the data of whole map cannot be transmitted to the mobile phone once for VR displaying. Based on the architecture of memory management for detecting loop closure in the RTAB-Map SLAM, an efficient memory management for extracting the point cloud data to achieve the real-time VR displaying performance is designed by utilizing the Bayesian filtering and data clustering.

This kind of video play-back, however, has to overcome several problems. First, the data volume of video clips can reach up to hundreds of gigabytes or more depending on the length of the clips, and the data has to be streamed into virtual reality (VR) systems in real-time. Second, the interactivity of the playback screen in 3D virtual environments requires efficient rendering of each video frame. Interactivity means that the plane of the video playback screen needs to rotate, translate, and zoom in and out in 3D space as the viewer roams around in the VE. This also means that the video is not necessarily parallel to the display screen but will need to be displayed as a general quadrangle. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm that utilizes mipmapped data, that is, multiple levels of resolutions, to provide an efficient way to interactively play back high resolution video content in VEs. In addition, we discuss several optimizations to sustain a constant frame rate, such as an optimized memory management mechanism, dynamic resolution adjustment, and predictive prefetching of data. Finally, we evaluate two video playback applications running on a virtual reality CAVE system: (1) high definition video at 3840 times 2160 pixels and (2) 32 independent 256 times 192 pixels video clips.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-3943-0","10.1109/VR.2009.4811038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811038","I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation¿Display algorithms;I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism¿Virtual Reality;H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation (e.g., HCI)]: Multimedia Information Systems¿Video","Virtual environment;Videoconference;High definition video;Memory management;Virtual reality;Computer graphics;Rendering (computer graphics);Streaming media;Image resolution;Tiles","image resolution;image texture;optimisation;rendering (computer graphics);video signal processing;video streaming;virtual reality","high resolution video playback;immersive virtual environment;virtual reality;video frame rendering;video streaming;mipmapped data;optimized memory management;dynamic resolution adjustment;predictive prefetching data;video texture","","1","","8","","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is difficult due to limited time in a class. We propose a Virtual Reality (VR) space imposing assignments on students, to know their understanding level from their behavior which comes from cognitive loads during their answering. The VR space presents a student an assignment and a working space to answer it. In general, students solve assignments, using elements on their short term memory. When students solve same kind of assignments many times, they build generalized solution methods in their long term memory. When they engage in such assignments, their cognitive load is low enough to make them watch only the working spaces, keeping their hands working. On the other hand, when students have no solution pattern, their short term memory works hard. Their high cognitive load often stop their hands, because of confusion. They also look assignments and the working space many times, to reconsider solutions. Since answering behavior of students exposes their cognitive load, a VR space is ideal to estimate cognitive load. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the ability of the method to estimate the cognitive load. We examined the movement of the hand and the edit distance of student's answer from the correct sentence during their answering. We confirmed a fair correlation of the hands' stagnation with the confidence in students of good scores. We also found a relationship of eye movement with the change of the edit distance. The experiment result implies the possibility to estimate the cognitive load. The estimation would enable teachers to know students' understanding faults, which leads to education according to the understanding level.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511187","","Task analysis;Aerospace electronics;Education;Magnetic heads;Virtual reality;Estimation;Information science","cognition;computer aided instruction;teaching;virtual reality","VR space;working space;short term memory;generalized solution methods;answering behavior;student understanding level;virtual reality space;cognitive load","","","","21","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software environments such as simulators are very flexible, and thus often used. On the other hand, if the target hardware is complex and large, it is very hard to finish the simulation in practical time because of software's slow simulation speed. Thus, we develop a hardware environment for efficient evaluation of computer systems. We propose and develop an IBM PC Compatible SoC on an FPGA where hardware developers can evaluate their custom architectures. The SoC has an x86 soft core processor which can run general purpose operating systems. By making the proposed system run on FPGAs of two major vendors, i.e. Xilinx and Altera, we believe that it can be widely adopted. Besides, the SoC can be used for learning computer systems, because of its open-source policy. In this paper, we detail the design and implementation of the proposed SoC, and verify that it accurately runs some applications. As a case study to demonstrate usability of the SoC for computer research, we implement two types of L2 caches in Verilog HDL and evaluate their performance by running the SPEC CPU2000 INT benchmark suite. Additionally, we discuss how the SoC can be used for computer education.","","978-1-4799-8670-5","10.1109/MCSoC.2015.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328188","SoC;FPGA;x86;Education;Reconfigurable-System","Hardware design languages;Field programmable gate arrays;Computers;Process control;Hardware;Random access memory;IP networks","computer aided instruction;computer architecture;computer science education;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;system-on-chip","reconfigurable IBM PC compatible SoC;system-on-chip;computer architecture education;computer architecture research;high performance computer systems;field programmable gate array;Xilinx FPGA;Altera FPGA;L2 cache;Verilog HDL;hardware description language;SPEC CPU2000 INT benchmark suite","","","","12","","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designing surgical simulators, however, poses the challenge of creating trainers that effectively instill not only high-level understanding of the steps to be taken in a given situation, but also the low-level “muscle-memory” needed to perform delicate surgical procedures. It is often impossible to build an ideal simulator that perfectly mimics the haptic experience of a surgical procedure, but by focussing on the aspects of the experience that are perceptually salient we can build simulators that effectively instill learning. We propose a general method for the design of surgical simulators that augment the perceptually salient aspects of an interaction. Using this method, we can increase skill-transfer rates without requiring expensive improvements in the capability of the rendering hardware or the computational complexity of the simulation. In this paper, we present our decomposition-based method for surgical simulator design, and describe a user-study comparing the training effectiveness of a haptic-search-task simulator designed using our method versus an unaugmented simulator. The results show that perception-based task decomposition can be used to improve the design of surgical simulators that effectively impart skill by targeting perceptually significant aspects of the interaction.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2011.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975145","Haptic I/O;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;life and medical sciences;surgical simulation.","Haptic interfaces;Surgery;Training;Needles;Rendering (computer graphics);Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","augmented reality;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;surgery","perceptually augmented simulator design;training simulator;air-traffic control;piloting;nuclear power station monitoring;surgical simulator;low-level muscle-memory;surgical procedure;haptic experience;salient interaction aspect;skill-transfer rate;rendering hardware;computational complexity;decomposition-based method;user study;haptic-search-task simulator;unaugmented simulator;perception-based task decomposition","","2","","21","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The availability of a camera and a large number of sensors in mobile devices will enable CV applications that understand the environment and enhance people's lives through augmented reality. One of the problems yet to solve is how to transfer demanding state-of-the-art CV algorithms -designed to run on powerful desktop computers with several GPUs- onto energy-efficient, but slow, processors and GPUs found in mobile devices. To accommodate to the lack of performance, current CV applications for mobile devices are simpler versions of more complex algorithms, which generally run slowly and unreliably and provide a poor user experience. In this paper, we investigate ways to speed up demanding CV applications to run faster on mobile devices. We selected KinectFusion (KF) as a representative CV application. The KF application constructs a 3D model from the images captured by a Kinect. After porting it to an ARM platform, we applied several optimisation and parallelisation techniques using OpenCL to exploit all the available computing resources. We evaluated the impact on performance and power and demonstrate a 4× speedup with just a 1.38× power increase. We also evaluated the performance portability of our optimisations by running on a different platform, and assessed similar improvements despite the different multi-core configuration and memory system. By measuring processor temperature, we found overheating to be the main limiting factor for running such high-performance codes on a mobile device not designed for full continuous utilisation.","","978-1-4673-7311-1","10.1109/SAMOS.2015.7363653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363653","","Graphics processing units;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Optimization;Computational modeling;Performance evaluation","augmented reality;cameras;computer vision;graphics processing units;image capture;mobile computing;mobile handsets;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation","high-performance codes;memory system;multicore configuration;computing resources;ARM platform;image capture;3D model;KF application;KinectFusion;CV algorithms;augmented reality;CV applications;mobile devices;sensors;computer vision applications;mobile computing platforms","","4","","17","","28 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of these machines was influenced by the then dominant idea that processors would have maintained a Von-Neumann model while hiding non-Von Neumann aspects in their internal structure. Recently Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), as well as the Cell BE architecture, have broken this assumption, exposing to programs forms of non-determinism going beyond the traditional model. These architectures are difficult to target from the Just-In-Time compiler module of a Virtual Machine (VM) because their features (execution and memory models) are hidden from the abstraction layer provided by the intermediate language. This is a symptom of a diverging gap between the actual architectures and the abstract view offered by the VM that will eventually lead to the under-use of hardware resources by VM-based programs.In this research I introduce a set of types and meta-data to represent different parallel computations, so that programmers are freed from the task of specifying parallelism, communication, synchronization, etc.At runtime, through reflection a meta-program can evaluate the meta-data and generates required code for exploiting the special features of the underlying non-Von Neumann architectures.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-3726-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254188","Virtual Machine;Runtime code generation;meta-programming;parallel computation models;General Purpose GPU","Concurrent computing;Virtual machining;Reflection;Virtual manufacturing;Computer architecture;Libraries;Graphics;Hardware;Programming profession;Parallel processing","just-in-time;multiprocessing programs;program compilers;software architecture;virtual machines;virtual reality","concurrency paradigms;virtual execution systems;virtual machines;Von-Neumann model;graphics processing units;just-in-time compiler;non-Von Neumann architectures","","","","20","","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mnemonics is a technique for memorizing a number of unstructured items that has been known for more than two millennia and was used in ancient Greece. Although its utility is remarkable, acquiring the skill to take advantage of mnemonics is generally difficult. In this study we propose a new method of increasing the effectiveness of classic mnemonics by facilitating the process of memorizing and applying mnemonics. The spatial electronic mnemonics (SROM) proposed here is partly based on an ancient technique that utilizes locations and images that reflect the characteristics of human memory. We first present the design of the SROM as a working hypothesis that augments traditional mnemonics using a portable computer. Then an augmented virtual memory peg (vMPeg) that incorporates a graphic numeral and a photograph of a location is introduced as a first implementation for generating a vMPeg. In an experiment, subjects exhibited remarkable retention of the vMPegs over a long interval. The second phase of placing items to remember on a generated vMPeg was also examined in a preliminary experiment, which also indicated good subject performance. In addition to evaluating the SROM by anylysing the scores for correct recall, a subjective evaluation was performed to investigate the nature of the SROM.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-1971-5","10.1109/VR.2008.4480777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4480777","Memory augmentation;Wearable computer;Visual images;Space and place;VR application;H.5.m [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Miscellaneous;K.3.1 [Computer Uses in Education]: Computer-assisted instruction (CAI)","Humans;Wearable computers;Graphics;Computer aided instruction;Pervasive computing;Portable computers;Virtual reality;Application software;Computer interfaces;Electronic mail","augmented reality;neurophysiology;virtual reality;wearable computers","spatial electronic mnemonics;human memory augmentation;wearable devices;smartphone devices;portable computer;augmented virtual memory peg;vMPeg;SROM","","2","","14","","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is significant in real time game environment. Even with the use of powerful graphics workstations, a moderately complex virtual environment can involve a vast amount of computation, inducing a noticeable lag into the system. This lag can detrimentally affect the visual effect and may therefore severely compromise the diffusion of the quality of graphics application. This paper introduced to overcome the limitation of conventional technique. Surface attributes such as normal, colors and textures, which are essentials to bring out the beauty of 3D object are preserved and discussed. The first process is to convert the input data into a memory efficient format. Next, the datasets are organized in an octree structure and later the partitioned meshes are kept in secondary memory (hard disk). Subsequently, sub-meshes are simplified using a new variation of vertex clustering technique. In order to maintain the surface attributes, a vertex clustering technique that collapses all triangles in every leaf node using the generalized quadric error metrics is introduced. Unlike any other vertex clustering methods, the knowledge of neighbourhood between nodes is unnecessary and the node simplification is performed independently. Overall, the proposed algorithm is capable in simplifying large datasets with pleasant quality and relatively fast. The system can run efficiently on low cost personal computer with small memory footprint.","","978-1-4244-3771-9","10.1109/UKSIM.2009.120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809801","","Computer applications;Application software;Computer graphics;Computer displays;Virtual environment;Computational modeling;Three dimensional displays;Workstations;Visual effects;Surface texture","computer games;computer graphics;pattern clustering","computer game;3D interactive graphics application;vertex clustering technique;generalized quadric error metrics;low cost personal computer","","","","9","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the psychophysical dimensions of the material properties cover a wide range of percepts, embedded tactile perception systems require efficient signal feature extraction and classification techniques to process signals collected by tactile sensors in real-time. For this purpose, we developed two embedded systems, one that served as a vibrotactile stimulator system and one that recorded and classified the vibrotactile signals collected by its sensors. The quality of the collected data was first verified offline using Fourier transform for feature extraction and then applying powerful machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines and neural networks. We implemented the proposed memory-less signal feature extraction method in order to achieve real-time processing as the data is being collected. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method significantly reduces the computational complexity of feature extraction and still has led to high classification accuracy even when fed to the less complex classifiers such as random forests that can be easily implemented on embedded systems.

Without it, we cannot understand our environment, situate ourselves within it, or remember where items are located. Most research on the neural basis of spatial memory is conducted either with invasive brain recordings from animals or with non-invasive imaging in humans. An emerging way to link these areas is by studying rare invasive recordings from the human brain, which can be obtained from epilepsy patients who have electrodes surgically implanted for seizure mapping. In recent years this invasive method has expanded our understanding of how the human brain represents space and has also suggested methods for modulating and potentially rehabilitating memory. However, it is unclear whether these results from epilepsy patients generalize to the non-epileptic population, and from testing in hospital rooms to more immersive and comfortable setups. Here, groups of epilepsy patients (n=69) and healthy participants (n=17) performed the same virtual spatial memory task, enabling us to compare their spatial memory performance. Moreover, we compared spatial memory performance between a standard computer screen versus a head-mounted display. We found that the spatial memory performance of epilepsy patients performing our task in a hospital was similar to that of matched healthy participants performing the task in the lab. Furthermore, actual spatial memory performance was similar on the group level irrespective of the interface used, despite the fact that subjects reported higher immersion with the head mounted display. By showing consistent spatial memory performance with a single paradigm across epilepsy patients and healthy participants, as well as with the use of different display modalities, our results provide a baseline for evaluating findings regarding the neural basis of spatial memory and neuromodulation for rehabilitation.

Inferring the forces applied to the person's body by the garment might enable a robot to provide more effective assistance and give the robot insight into what the person feels. However, complex mechanics govern the relationship between the robot's end effector and these forces. Using a physics-based simulation and data-driven methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of inferring forces across a person's body using only end effector measurements. Specifically, we present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that at each time step takes a 9-dimensional input vector of force, torque, and velocity measurements from the robot's end effector and outputs a force map consisting of hundreds of inferred force magnitudes across the person's body. We trained and evaluated LSTMs on two tasks: pulling a hospital gown onto an arm and pulhng shorts onto a leg. For both tasks, the LSTMs produced force maps that were similar to ground truth when visualized as heat maps across the limbs. We also evaluated their performance in terms of root-mean-square error. Their performance degraded when the end effector velocity was increased outside the training range, but generalized well to limb rotations. Overall, our results suggest that robots could learn to infer the forces people feel during robot-assisted dressing, although the extent to which this will generalize to the real world remains an open question.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989718","","Force;Clothing;End effectors;Force measurement;Estimation;Legged locomotion","clothing;end effectors;force control;human-robot interaction;mean square error methods;service robots;velocity control","applied forces;robot-assisted dressing;garment;complex mechanics;physics-based simulation;data-driven methods;long short-term memory network;LSTM;9-dimensional input vector;velocity measurements;force map;inferred force magnitudes;hospital gown;heat maps;root-mean-square error;end effector velocity;training range","","12","","24","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While virtualization has attracted a great deal of research and implementations to date, some its potential benefits are not utilized when institutions have to provide and maintain fully virtualized environments. In this paper, we introduce Portable Student Labs (PSLabs) based on the QEMU virtualization environment. PSLabs are fully portable virtualized environments that students obtain and afterwards execute either in common computing facilities available on-campus or on their individual computing equipment, thus eliminating the need for dedicated (lab-specific) computing hardware or virtual environments.

Although AR and VR have tremendous potential, current interfaces and applications are still limited in their ability to recognize context, user understanding, and intention, which can limit the options for customized individual user support and the ease of automation. This paper addresses the problem of automatically recognizing whether or not a user has an understanding of a certain term, which is directly applicable to AR/VR interfaces for language and concept learning. To do so, we first designed an interactive word recall task in VR that required non-native English speakers to assess their knowledge of English words, many of which were difficult or uncommon. Using an eye tracker integrated into the VR Display, we collected a variety of eye movement metrics that might correspond to the user's knowledge or memory of a particular word. Through experimentation, we show that both eye movement and pupil radius have a high correlation to user memory, and that several other metrics can also be used to help classify the state of word understanding. This allowed us to build a support vector machine (SVM) that can predict a user's knowledge with an accuracy of 62% in the general case and and 75% for easy versus medium words, which was tested using cross-fold validation. We discuss these results in the context of in-situ learning applications.","","978-1-7281-5604-0","10.1109/AIVR46125.2019.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8942340","virtual reality;eye tracking;memory;cognition;pupillometry;classification","Measurement;Gaze tracking;Pupils;Virtual reality;Task analysis;Cognition;Head","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;gaze tracking;interactive systems;linguistics;support vector machines;user interfaces;vocabulary","concept learning;interactive word recall task;eye tracker;VR display;eye movement metrics;pupil radius;user memory;support vector machine;in-situ learning applications;virtual reality;vocabulary understanding classification;AR/VR interfaces;language learning","","2","","28","","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two of the earliest indicators of potential neurocognitive problems are motor and visual dysfunction. Motor disorders and problems in visual cognition can be seen in many neurocognitive disorders, resulting in abnormal physical reactions to visual stimuli. Analyzing physical behaviors when presented with such stimuli can provide insights into the visual perception and motor abilities of an individual, yet there is currently no unbiased, objective, general-purpose tool that analyzes attention and motor behavior to assess neurocognitive function. We propose a novel method of neurocognitive function assessment that tests the patient's cognition using virtual reality with eye tracking and motion analysis. By placing the patient in a controlled virtual environment and analyzing their movements, we can evoke certain physical responses from subjects for neurocognitive assessment. We have developed a prototype system that places the subject in a virtual baseball field and captures their full body motion as they try to catch baseballs. This scenario tests the subject's ability to determine the landing time and position of the ball, as well as the test subject's balance, motor skills, attention, and memory. Preliminary tests with 20 healthy normal individuals demonstrate the ability of this tool to assess the test subject's balance, memory, attention, and reaction to visual stimuli. This platform has a twofold contribution: it is used to assess several neurocognitive constructs that affect visual and motor capability neutrally and objectively based on controlled stimuli, and it enables objective comparison between different neurocognitive disorders research in this field.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2881455","Comcast Media and Technology Center; CU Denver ORS; Department of Education GAANN Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536376","Behavioral analysis;motor skills;neurocognitive assessment;virtual reality;visual cognition","Visualization;Tools;Sports;Tracking;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality","brain;cognition;gaze tracking;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;virtual reality;visual perception","neurocognitive function assessment;virtual reality;eye tracking;motion analysis;controlled virtual environment;physical responses;virtual baseball field;visual stimuli;motor capability;behavioral response analysis;visual dysfunction;motor disorders;visual cognition;visual perception;motor behavior;physical behaviors;neurocognitive problems","Adult;Aged;Cognition;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Psychomotor Performance;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","1","","58","Traditional","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, to handle the volume visibility, we solve the area visibility problem. The proposed method expresses area visibility information into 3D space and keeps it with a BSP (binary space partitioning) tree. Area visibility information is image plane information for every viewpoint within the view rectangle. To express the area visibility information in 3D space, we present a modified ghost polygon and a method for reducing dependency between axes in the view rectangle.

This study proposes the visual attention patterns in floorplan review to be a stronger predictor of human navigation behaviors.

The proposed approach implements a computational model inspired by the generalized motor program (GMP) theory. Operationally, when a novel motion scenario is submitted to the MBMS system, its motion database is searched to find relevant existing motions. The selected motions, referred to as ""root motions"", most likely do not meet exactly the novel motion scenario, and therefore, they need to be modified by the MoM algorithm. This algorithm derives a parametric representation of possible variants of a root motion in a GMP-like manner, and adjusts the parameter values such that the new modified motion satisfies the novel motion scenario, while retaining the root motion's overall angular movement pattern and inter-joint coordination. An evaluation of the prediction capability of the algorithm, using both seated upper body reaching and whole-body load-transfer motions, indicated that the algorithm can accurately predict various human motions with errors comparable to the inherent variability in human motions when repeated under identical task conditions.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.822965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288349","","Humans;Biological system modeling;Ergonomics;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Testing;Design automation;Man machine systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Prototypes","human computer interaction;ergonomics;digital simulation;motion estimation;CAD","memory-based human motion simulation;motion modification algorithm;computer simulation;human motion planning;human machine interaction;generalized motor program theory;motion database;parametric representation;root motion;angular movement pattern;interjoint coordination;load transfer motions;human motions","","49","2","51","","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The position versus force graph represents the energy behavior in a one-port haptic interface while the haptic interface is traveling in (pressed) or out of (released) a virtual environment (VE). It interprets that to make the one-port system passive, it is sufficient to bound the releasing path below the pressing path in the position versus force graph. To realize the bound, the computed force output from the VE is saved into a designated memory, addressed by current position, while the haptic interface is pressed. Thereafter, the saved force can be reused to upper-bound the releasing path below the saved pressing path while the haptic interface is released. The proposed method is generalized from preliminary work by including interaction with a moving virtual object and multi-DOF extension, together with more systematic and detailed explanations about the methods. In particular, we reconfigure the one-port moving virtual object as a two-port haptic controller and a connected one-port moving inertia. This reconfiguration allows implementation of the preliminary approach including the interaction with moving virtual objects by using an error versus force passivity instead of a position versus force passivity. This two-port extension also allows generalization of the proposed method to multi-DOF interactions by introducing virtual proxy as a virtual moving object. The proposed method is tested with a single and a multi-DOF haptic interface and shows better performance than the recently proposed field-programmable gate array-based time-domain passivity approach .","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2013.2285380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648463","Haptic interfaces;human--robot interaction;stability;telerobotics","Force;Pressing;Haptic interfaces;Damping;Frequency modulation;Radiation detectors;Passivation","control engineering computing;haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;telerobotics;virtual reality","memory-based passivation approach;stable haptic interaction;graphical interpretation;passivation method;force graph;energy behavior;one-port haptic interface;virtual environment;one-port system;computed force output;pressing path;multiDOF extension;one-port moving virtual object;two-port haptic controller;one-port moving inertia;virtual objects;force passivity;multiDOF interaction;virtual proxy;virtual moving object;multiDOF haptic interface;field-programmable gate array-based time-domain passivity","","19","","23","","25 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve user satisfaction with VR applications, it is of great significance to develop objective metrics for VIMS that can analyze and estimate the level of VR sickness when a user is exposed to VEs. One of the well-known objective metrics is the postural instability. In this paper, we trained a LSTM model for each participant using a normal-state postural signal captured before the exposure, and if the postural sway signal from post-exposure was sufficiently different from the pre-exposure signal, the model would fail at encoding and decoding the signal properly; the jump in the reconstruction error was called loss and was proposed as the proposed objective measure of simulator sickness. The effectiveness of the proposed metric was analyzed and compared with subjective assessment methods based on the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) in a VR environment, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of. 89. Finally, we showed that the proposed method had the potential to be deployed within a closed-loop system and get real-time performance to predict VR sickness, opening new insights to develop user-centered and customized VR applications based on physiological feedback.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798213","Human-centered computing;Virtual reality;Walkthrough evaluations;User interface design;Interaction devices;Computing methodologies;Machine learning;Machine learning approaches;Neural networks","Navigation;Virtual environments;Physiology;Real-time systems;Three-dimensional displays;Logic gates;Deep learning","closed loop systems;human factors;physiology;recurrent neural nets;virtual reality","VR sickness prediction;navigation;immersive virtual environments;deep long short term memory model;visually induced motion sickness;VIMS;VEs;physical environments;physiological symptoms;general discomfort;dizziness;fatigue;user satisfaction;VR applications;postural instability;LSTM model;normal-state postural signal;postural sway signal;post-exposure;pre-exposure signal;objective measure;simulator sickness questionnaire;VR environment;user-centered VR applications","","1","","34","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the cloud gaming terminology, the users who have poor resources are referred to as “Thin Clients”. On the other hand, cloud service providers should be able to provide minimum frame rate required by a computer game, simultaneously, to several thin clients at the same time, in such a way that meets the users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Generally, computer games have different degrees of render settings by default, in terms of three levels: high, medium, and low. These setting levels, in turn, can be translated into hardware and operating system capabilities, such as maximum textual details, brightness, contrast, and so on. Cloud game service providers use rendering settings as a means for transferring the frames of the game to thin clients. They also try to maximize their own profits with pricing on game frames. This paper addresses the subject of resource optimization using a pricing mechanism. The designed mechanism is able to allocate game frames in such a way that leads to achieving high user QoE and also maximizing the profit of the cloud server. We set the price of the frames considering their types. Each type has its own processor, memory, GPU requirements, etc. Our goal is to find the optimal combination of types for each user. Our proposed method is able to dynamically adapt itself to the requirements of both sides of the network. We also consider the scheduling issues of the cloud server in order to transfer the frames to the requested users. When the number of users is very high, the proposed mechanism applies the settings in such a way that the QoE is maintained at the desired level and the user's satisfaction is not violated at all. Simulation results show that the proposed priced-based approach attains lower bandwidth consumption values compared to the case in which no pricing mechanism is used. Also, the social welfare of the users is maximized.","","978-1-7281-1114-8","10.1109/DGRC.2018.8712028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712028","Cloud Gaming;Frame Rate Allocation;Multi-rate;Knapsack Problem;Integer Linear Programming","Quality of experience;Games;Delays;Bandwidth;Servers;Resource management","cloud computing;computer games;optimisation;pricing;quality of experience;resource allocation","frame rate optimization;cloud services;hardware capabilities;cloud gaming terminology;cloud service providers;minimum frame rate;computer game;render settings;setting levels;operating system capabilities;cloud game service providers;game frames;resource optimization;pricing mechanism;high user QoE;cloud server;priced-based approach;cloud gaming networks","","1","","25","","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has the potential to improve learning outcomes by merging educational content with spatial cues and semantically relevant objects within a learner's everyday environment. The impact of such an interface could be comparable to the method of loci, a well known memory enhancement technique used by memory champions and polyglots. However, using Augmented Reality in this manner is still impractical for a number of reasons. Scalable object recognition and consistent labeling of objects is a significant challenge, and interaction with arbitrary (unmodeled) physical objects in AR scenes has consequently not been well explored. To help address these challenges, we present a framework for in-situ object labeling and selection in Augmented Reality, with a particular focus on language learning applications. Our framework uses a generalized object recognition model to identify objects in the world in real time, integrates eye tracking to facilitate selection and interaction within the interface, and incorporates a personalized learning model that dynamically adapts to student's growth. We show our current progress in the development of this system, including preliminary tests and benchmarks.

The first successful GGP agents all followed that approach. In this paper, we describe CadiaPlayer, a GGP agent employing a radically different approach: instead of a traditional game-tree search, it uses Monte Carlo simulations for its move decisions. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate different simulation-based approaches on a wide variety of games, introduce a domain-independent enhancement for automatically learning search-control knowledge to guide the simulation playouts, and show how to adapt the simulation searches to be more effective in single-agent games.

Consequently, these applications require powerful computation, extensive high-bandwidth memory, and fast communication links. In the past, the manufacturers of medical imaging equipment produced their own special-purpose proprietary hardware for image processing and solid graphics. Due to the developments in computer hardware in general and in graphics accelerators in particular, there is a trend toward replacing the proprietary hardware off-the-shelf (OTS) equipment. Computer graphics itself has advanced in its quest for realism. Generic algorithms such as shading, texture mapping, and volume rendering have been developed to meet the resultant ever increasing requirements. Advances in both the OTS CPU and graphics hardware have enabled real-time implementations of these algorithms, thereby facilitating many of the medical VR/AR applications used today. The development of graphics libraries such as OpenGL has also been an important factor. These libraries provide an underlying portable software platform that optimizes the utilization of the available graphics hardware. OpenGL has become a standard graphics application programming interface, particularly for graphics-intensive applications, and more and more OTS systems provide hardware implementations of OpenGL commands. The review paper follows the evolution of these technologies and examines their crucial role in enabling the appearance of the current VR/AR applications in medicine and provides a look at current trends and future possibilities.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.662878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=662878","","Virtual reality;Hardware;Biomedical imaging;Application software;Computer graphics;Software libraries;Augmented reality;Data visualization;Computer applications;Manufacturing processes","virtual reality;medicine;medical image processing;application program interfaces;subroutines;rendering (computer graphics);libraries;computer graphic equipment;real-time systems;data visualisation","medical virtual reality;advanced graphics;algorithms;software interfaces;graphics hardware;augmented reality;medicine;real-time visualization;real-time modeling;large 3D data sets;computation;high-bandwidth memory;fast communication link;medical imagining;graphics accelerators;shading;texture mapping;volume rendering;graphics libraries;OpenGL;portable software platform;graphics application programming interface","","12","43","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We are developing a system for folding origami over the Web, by designing a model of an origami folding process and by implementing a client-server system. Our system consists of three parts: the origami editor, origami server and origami browser. The origami editor enables the user to create and edit origami projects, which are sequences of origami states and folding methods. The origami server receives the input data from the editor and generates a VRML 2.0 data stream, which represents a transition between two origami states. The VRML 2.0 data stream is then displayed by the origami browser, or a VRML 2.0 browser, as a 3-D origami figure in motion.","","0-8186-8347-3","10.1109/APCHI.1998.704454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=704454","","Videos;Books;Read only memory;Educational institutions;Art;Shape;Mathematics;Computer science;Client-server systems;Electrical capacitance tomography","computer animation;solid modelling;user interfaces;Internet;client-server systems;virtual reality","origami editor;paperfolding;Japanese art;3D figure representation;2D images;diagrams;World Wide Web;client-server system;origami server;origami browser;VRML;animation","","2","","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These five facets are information banks, symbol pads, construction kits, 'phenomenaria' and task managers. 'Phenomenaria' are areas for the specific purpose of presenting phenomena and making them accessible to scrutiny and manipulation. Taken together these five facets offer a perspective on the general structure and style of the learning environment. A collection of processes, which are distinct, spatially separated, and which communicate by exchanging messages constitutes a distributed system. A distributed algorithm defines the steps to be taken by each process within that system, including the transfer of messages. It must be able to deal with the failure of one or more of the processes involved in its computation and also the failure of one or more message transmissions. A major problem in teaching the latter material is the ability to capture the dynamic movement of data. Typically, when demonstrating data movement on a white board, part of the existing data configuration must be erased in order to show the new configuration. A phenomenarium offers a way forward for both lecturers and students in that it provides mechanisms not only to animate but to simulate dynamic movement in visual form. Moreover, it can be housed within an environment that permits 'anytime anywhere' learning, like the World Wide Web. Simply stated, a phenomenarium permits a student to interact with elements of a given algorithm in their own time. An argument in favor of the use of the latter in the teaching of distributed algorithms is presented.","","0-7695-1967-9","10.1109/ICALT.2003.1215071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215071","","Education;Educational institutions;Distributed algorithms;Environmental management;Feedback;Probes;Animation;Web sites;Displays","distributed memory systems;distributed algorithms;message passing;digital simulation;Internet;teaching;computer science education","learning environment;distributed systems concept teaching;Phenomenaria;distributed system;message transmission;dynamic data movement simulation;white board data movement;real time visual display;World Wide Web;distributed algorithm teaching","","1","","7","","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of several performance metrics, the recurrent networks are shown to generally match or outperform baseline methods in replicating driver behavior, including smoothness and oscillatory characteristics present in real trajectories. This paper reveals that the strong performance is due to the ability of the recurrent network to identify recent trends in the ego-vehicle's state, and recurrent networks are shown to perform as, well as feedforward networks with longer histories as inputs.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2603007","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565491","Recurrent neural networks;car-following models;prediction methods;autonomous vehicles;deep learning","Vehicles;Acceleration;Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Recurrent neural networks","feedforward neural nets;human factors;probability;recurrent neural nets;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","recurrent neural networks;probabilistic modeling;driver behavior;traffic simulation model;driver acceleration profiles;acceleration distributions;long short-term memory recurrent network training;simulated vehicle trajectory propagation;oscillatory characteristics;smoothness characteristics;ego-vehicle state;feedforward networks;car-following models","","91","","49","","13 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motivated by recent evidence that nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide higher performance iBCI cursor control in nonhuman primates (NHPs), we evaluated decoding of intended cursor velocity from human motor cortical signals using a long-short term memory (LSTM) RNN trained across multiple days of multi-electrode recordings. Running simulations with previously recorded intracortical signals from three BrainGate iBCI trial participants, we demonstrate an RNN that can substantially increase bits-per-second metric in a high-speed cursor-based target selection task as well as a challenging small-target high-accuracy task when compared to a Kalman decoder.

In this study, 45 participants experienced virtual rollercoaster rides while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG).

This work employs a SAN as a technique to provide the interface's action selection mechanism in an uncertain environment. The paper combines the SAN with the temporal logic to provide an e-learning system that a learning activity level evolves according to their expected contextual relevance. The system differs from the other e-learning by representing dynamic associations between learning activities and the relevance subjects. This system equipped with an event-triggered learning interface (context) adaptation component. This component provides multiple parallel processes for perception. These processes provide context screen selection and learning task operation based upon the user current situation. The SAN attempts to achieve a number of goals in an unpredictable complex dynamic environment. Spreading activation explains the predictive top-down effect of knowledge. It supports general heuristics which may be used as the first step of more elaborated methods. This model is suited to deal with the interaction between semantic and episodic memories, as well as many other practical issues regarding e-learning, including the retroactive effect of semantics over perception. The system uses the SAN to activate the most suitable interface screen (context) in response to the current conditions (learning activities) while the system continues working towards the learning objective goal. The paper presents our efforts to realize such e-learning system.

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","computer aided instruction;computer animation;computer science education;solid modelling;student experiments;training;Turing machines;virtual reality","virtual experiments;virtual reality technology;introduction to computing;public course;student training;computer science;computational thinking;teaching contents;Turing machine;computer organization;3D modeling;animation;human-machine interaction;demonstration experiments;verification experiments;interaction experiments;software copyrights;teaching effectiveness;learning efficiency","","5","","10","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As predicted, the ""send"" icon was effective in maintaining information flow, particularly when time pressure was high and simulated teammates sent less information, because it reduced memory burden and supported proactive behavior. The ""receive"" icon was only effective in supporting decision accuracy when time pressure was low. As time pressure increased, participants' with the ""receive"" icon increasingly used a strategy of making decisions before reading the most important information, completely counter to expectations. These results illustrate the subtle, sometimes surprising way task characteristics (e.g., time pressure) can affect participants' strategies and, thereby, nullify the positive effect of displays on performance.

Generally speaking, daily living activities hardly remain in our memory, so that, determining the order and priority of daily tasks can be difficult. There are studies supporting daily chores based on a behavior log and aiming to improve the work efficiency by using a memory aid. However, most of the existing studies require pre-installation of costly devices such as cameras and sensors, and are limited to supporting a particular task or purpose. There have been proposed many methods based on Augmented Reality (AR) which annotate captured images of the real world with texts, but text-based information may frustrate users. More intuitive user interfaces are required. In this paper, we first propose a user's behavior log management technique which associates each activity log with an object/location in the target indoor space. Then, we propose a method for reproducing AR-based visual effects on the object/location determined based on the log; the method naturally navigates the user to carrying out the intended task. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed method and have conducted subjective surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed visual effects. We thereby, confirmed that the proposed visual effects can make users more intuitively aware of the intended task than the text-based annotation method.","","978-1-4673-5077-8","10.1109/PerComW.2013.6529575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529575","","Containers;Visual effects;Accuracy;Cameras;Cleaning;Mobile handsets;Visualization","augmented reality;user interfaces","daily living activity;augmented reality;indoor environment;memory aid;captured image annotation;intuitive user interfaces;user behavior log management;visual effect","","1","","21","","8 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present an autonomous multi agent path planning system with agents-in-formation constraints in a distributed computing environment. Here a given agent, an entity with behaviors, exchanges sensory positioning feedback information over the network with other agents that are running on separate networked distributed computing nodes than the one the given agent is running on. Hence the agents do not have complete knowledge of the environment, but only a limited one. That is, in keeping with the agent formation constraint, the agents have knowledge only of the agents' information residing on the distributed memory of the computing node the agents are running on. The agents exchange agents' positioning sensory information of the rest of the agents they are interacting with, over a distributed network. Here agents autonomous trajectory planning is achieved for each agent to reach its destination via an unstructured distributed environment filled with dynamic obstacles and other agents. One focus is on the agents achieving their goals under real time formation constraints. We propose a multi-threaded architecture to achieve light-weight concurrency and multi-agent cooperative concurrency, as they allow separation between address space and thread control. Additionally, a threads-based architecture benefits from non-blocking system calls. Finally, experimental results are presented to show the potential of the proposed method for multi-agent distributed path planning.","2379-1675","978-1-4673-0345-3","10.1109/CogSIMA.2012.6188369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188369","Autonomous Multiagent;Distributed Environment;Trajectory Planning;Hierarchical Architecture;Scheduling;Formation;Message Passing Interface","Computer architecture;Message systems;Distributed computing;Message passing;Multiagent systems;Load management;Navigation","collision avoidance;concurrency control;digital simulation;feedback;military computing;multi-agent systems;multi-threading;navigation","distributed behavioral-based technique;multiagent sensory;event-driven autonomous formation;event-driven autonomous navigation;complex system;multiagent modeling;multiagent simulation;military application;concurrent task planning;decision making;battlefield modeling;battlefield simulation;soldier virtual training;distributed architecture;heterogeneous operating system;hardware platform;autonomous multiagent path planning system;agents-in-formation constraint;distributed computing environment;agent behavior;sensory positioning feedback information;networked distributed computing nodes;agent information;distributed memory;agent autonomous trajectory planning;unstructured distributed environment;dynamic obstacles;real time formation constraint;multithreaded architecture;light-weight concurrency;multiagent cooperative concurrency;address space;thread control;nonblocking system call;multiagent distributed path planning","","","","24","","23 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, such systems are key to effective environmental designs that facilitate aging in place. Typically, gesture recognition takes the form of template matching in which the human participant is expected to emulate a choreographed motion as prescribed by the researchers. A corresponding robotic action is then a one-to-one mapping of the template classification to a library of distinct responses. In this paper, we explore a recognition scheme based on the growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm that places no initial constraints on the user to perform gestures in a specific way. Motion descriptors extracted from sequential skeletal depth data are clustered by GNG and mapped directly to a robotic response that is refined through reinforcement learning. A simple good/bad reward signal is provided by the user. This paper presents results that show that the topology-preserving quality of GNG allows generalization between gestured commands. Experimental results using an automated reward are presented that compare learning results involving single nodes versus results involving the influence of node neighborhoods. Although separability of input data influences the speed of learning convergence for a given neighborhood radius, it is shown that learning progresses toward emulation of an associative memory that maps input gesture to desired action.","2168-2305","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2291714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687233","Gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;machine learning;robots","Robot sensing systems;Gesture recognition;Neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Topology","gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;image classification;neurocontrollers;path planning;robot vision;robots","gesture learning interface;simulated robot path shaping;human teacher;human gesture recognition;intuitive human-machine interfaces;ubiquitous computing;assistive robotics;template matching;one-to-one mapping;choreographed motion emulation;template classification;GNG algorithm;growing neural gas;motion descriptors;sequential skeletal depth data;reinforcement learning;good-bad reward signal;topology-preserving quality;generalization;node neighborhoods;input data separability;associative memory","","23","","75","","18 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate solutions can be found in real-time and suboptimal extrema are robustly avoided, scaling well even for greatly higher degree of freedom. The algorithm provides a general framework for bounded continuous optimization which only requires two parameters for the number of individuals and elites to be set, and supports adding additional goals and constraints for inverse kinematics, such as minimal displacement between solutions, collision avoidance, or functional joint relations.

"Examination of pilot benefits from cognitive assistance for single-pilot general aviation operations","S. A. Wilkins","The MITRE Corporation, McLean, Virginia","2017 IEEE/AIAA 36th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","9 Nov 2017","2017","","","1","9","Evaluating the human factors of new cockpit technologies is a time consuming and expensive task. A typical human-in-the-loop evaluation can take several months to design, execute, and document. Moreover, retaining statistical power requires placing hard limits on the technological variations and scenarios to be tested, drawing out the iterative design process. These studies, however, ensure that flight deck technologies are efficient, effective, and, from a pilot mental effort perspective, manageable. While eliminating human-in-the-loop evaluation is neither recommended nor desired, methods that can reduce the number of design cycles and help human-in-the-loop evaluations target the most promising design concepts are valuable. One such method is fast-time simulation of the pilot activities to assess task times and working memory load using human performance modeling. Well-established task analysis methodologies, i.e., Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules (GOMS), with theories of working memory and mental effort are able to provide estimates of temporal and mental effort for a task [1]. The MITRE Corporation developed a tool for this purpose, which is a cognitive calculator or “Cogulator.” This paper describes an example of using Cogulator for modeling mental effort with and without a pilot-oriented cognitive assistant, called the Digital Copilot. The Digital Copilot, developed through sponsorship from the Federal Aviation Administration by The MITRE Corporation, is a working prototype that provides contextual information and reminders to the pilot in a timely manner [2]. This study compares two different modes of operation using Cogulator: a single pilot's thoughts and actions during the approach phase of flight without the Digital Copilot and another with the Digital Copilot. Cogulator uses the task decompositions in each mode of operation to estimate three metrics: the pilot's task times, heads down times, and working memory load. Task time is a summary statistic that describes the amount of time that elapsed for a task to be completed. Heads down time is the amount of time that a pilot spends looking at information within the cockpit instead of outside. Working memory load is the cognitive construct in which information is temporarily stored and manipulated to complete complex tasks [3]. The paper describes Cogulator, the evaluation method, and the results of the comparison. Results are presented in terms of task completion time, heads down time, and working memory load during the approach phase of flight for the following five tasks: check automatic terminal information service (ATIS) frequency, receive contextual frequency, review and follow a checklist, determine if the tower is open, and determine the preferred runway. Of these five tasks modeled, results show that the Digital Copilot provides time savings in all tasks except for check ATIS frequency; heads down time savings for all tasks; and working memory load savings or no change for all tasks.","2155-7209","978-1-5386-0365-9","10.1109/DASC.2017.8101987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101987","cognitive modeling;working memory load;general aviation;single-pilot operation;Cogulator;GOMS;electronic flight bags","Load modeling;Tools;Time-frequency analysis;Software;Visualization;Brain modeling","aerospace computing;aerospace simulation;aircraft displays;cognition;human factors;statistical analysis;task analysis","cognitive assistance;pilot benefit examination;design concepts;task analysis methodologies;head down times;statistical power;goals, operators, methods, and selection rules;GOMS;MITRE Corporation;Federal Aviation Administration;contextual information;automatic terminal information service frequency;ATIS;contextual frequency;checklist;memory load savings;time savings;task completion time;evaluation method;complex tasks;task decompositions;timely manner;working prototype;Digital Copilot;cognitive assistant;Cogulator;human performance modeling;working memory load;pilot activities;fast-time simulation;design cycles;pilot mental effort perspective;flight deck technologies;iterative design process;technological variations;human-in-the-loop evaluation;cockpit technologies;human factors;single-pilot general aviation operations","","3","","17","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performances of the two approaches appear to equal each other on low branching factor and less memory demanding games similar to tic-tac-toe.","","978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406673","Monte Carlo Tree Search;Q-learning;General Game Playing;Local Regression","Games;Monte Carlo methods;Regression tree analysis;Educational institutions;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Learning","computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);Monte Carlo methods;regression analysis;storage management;tree searching","local regression modeling;Monte Carlo tree search;random action selection;modified MCTS method;regular MCTS method;tic-tac-toe game;connect four game;memory demanding game;branching factor;Q-learning;general game playing","","","","10","","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a dual-path deep CNN (TDCNN) TSR model is built based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the cost function and recognition accuracy are selected as indicators to analyze the training results of the model. Second, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) RNN are utilized to assess the road traffic safety risks, and the prediction and evaluation effects of them are compared. Finally, the changes in safety risks of road traffic accidents are analyzed based on the two key influencing factors of the number of road intersections and the speed of vehicles traveling. The results show that the learning rate of the network model and the number of hidden neurons in the fully-connected layer directly affect the training results, and there are differences in the choices between the early and late training periods. Compared with RNN, the LSTM network model has higher evaluation accuracy, and its corresponding root square error (RSE) is 0.36. The rational control of the number of intersections and the speed of roads traveled has a significant impact on improving the safety level and promoting road traffic efficiency. The VR image recognition algorithm and safety risk prediction method based on a neural network model positively affect the construction of an intelligent transport network.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3032581","Education Department of Shaanxi Province; Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Basic Research Project; Education Department of Shaanxi Provincen; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233325","TDCNN;image recognition;RNN;LSTM;security risk;assessment","Training;Roads;Safety;Deep learning;Image recognition;Convolution;Predictive models","convolutional neural nets;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;virtual reality","VR image recognition algorithm;road traffic efficiency;safety level;LSTM network model;learning rate;road intersections;road traffic accidents;RNN;recognition accuracy;cost function;convolutional neural network;dual-path deep CNN TSR model;intelligent transportation networks;road traffic safety risks;virtual reality image recognition;deep intelligent learning technology;traffic sign recognition;deep convolution neural network;safety risk assessment;intelligent transport network;neural network model;safety risk prediction method","","","","23","CCBY","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique eliminates some of the problems which have restricted the performance of these systems for real-time presentation on raster displays. The DBMS uses two general principles to simplify the processing of digitally stored video images. Rather than storing a contiguous picture or sections of a picture, the technique stores a digitized photograph as a series of interlaced cells called I-cells. Each I-cell contains pixel information which is interlaced in both the horizontal and vertical directions. A virtual memory is used to allow selective updating of picture information. The bandwidth required to process a picture as resolution requirements change is significantly reduced. The technique permits high-resolution target areas to be surrounded with equally rich generic terrain; false cuing of pilots or operators toward resolution-rich target areas is minimized. The technique is suited for quick turnaround mission rehearsal using reconnaissance photography, single and multichannel simulator displays, and smart bomb or remotely piloted vehicle simulations.<>","","","10.1109/NAECON.1990.112889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=112889","","Image generation;Layout;Image resolution;Image storage;Image sampling;Information retrieval;Image retrieval;Hardware","aerospace computing;aerospace simulation;computerised picture processing;database management systems;military computing;photographic applications;training;virtual storage","3D;aerospace simulation;computerised picture processing;bandwidth reduction;photo based image generator;database management systems;real-time presentation;raster displays;digitally stored video images;digitized photograph;interlaced cells;I-cells;pixel information;virtual memory;selective updating;quick turnaround mission rehearsal;reconnaissance photography;multichannel simulator displays;smart bomb;remotely piloted vehicle simulations","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different methodological approaches and different tools have been used in the assessment of brain-injured patient's navigational abilities. These procedures include auto-evaluation questionnaires, evaluation of general cognitive level, mental rotation tasks or specifically suited visual-spatial tasks. All these methodologies have shown a moderate correlation between the results of these kinds of evaluation and the navigational ability impairment observed in everyday contexts. Meanwhile, the evaluation of patient's spatial orientation out of laboratory setting appears to be an unprofitable opportunity for clinicians. Thus the problem in designing an effective assessment tool is still open. A promising approach could be to integrate classical evaluation tools with computer-based interactive ones, such as virtual reality. According to this framework, we propose a combination of classical and virtual reality-based assessment, in which perceptive, memory and attentional functions (that combined each other are considered the hub for spatial orientation ability) will be evaluated with standardized neuropsychological tests and a more situated computer-based tools will allow the assessment of spatial orientation during the interaction with complex environments. Strictly linked with ""paper and pencil"" spatial disorientation neuropsychological evaluation, we propose two 3D virtual reality tools based on Wisc-R Maze subtest and road map test, customized to match interactive evaluation requirements. The first will provide the possibility to evaluate human ability of finding the best route to achieve a target goal while immersed in an empty environment. The second can be used to evaluate the ability in creating relationships between various points of the environment and in inferring, through the reasoning process, high-level spatial organization knowledge. By providing the possibility to track user's spatial behaviours, a virtual reality-based evaluation allows an effective and objective record of all the experimental variables. It also avoids the intervention of the experimenter, which may interfere with the actions of the agent-explorer. The main hypothesis of our research is that the integration of virtual reality-based tools with traditional evaluation methods will improve the evaluation of topographical disorientation in brain-injured patients","2331-9569","1-4244-0280-8","10.1109/IWVR.2006.1707537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707537","","Humans;Virtual reality;Navigation;Brain injuries;Dementia;Lesions;Laboratories;Space exploration;Vehicles;Patient monitoring","brain;medical diagnostic computing;navigation;patient diagnosis;psychology;virtual reality","computer-enhanced route knowledge assessment;spatial knowledge assessment;clinical neuropsychology;topographical disorientation;brain injury;patient navigational abilities;cognitive level evaluation;mental rotation;visual-spatial tasks;navigational ability impairment;spatial orientation;3D virtual reality tools;Wisc-R Maze subtest;road map test;interactive evaluation;spatial behaviour","","1","","40","","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this paper is to present a novel framework to create marker based augmented reality applications for mobile devices. The framework is composed of five main subsystems: a) presentation: with a game engine as the core component, b) tracking: which performs all the computer vision algorithms, c) interaction: composed of a custom visual editor which processes all the inputs to the framework, d) world model: used to store and provide access to the digital representation of the world, and e) context: used to provide status information of the entire system. All the subsystems were used to provide for users a comprehensive way to develop and share prefabricated objects that allow reusability across applications. A particular case, of an interactive “pARabola plotting” application, is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the framework. The application was tested in four mobile devices running Android OS. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the framework to create usable mobile AR applications, observing better visual and interaction results on the higher quality mobile devices.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2015.7069096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069096","Android operating system;Augmented reality;Framework;Mobile devices;Reusable components","Random access memory;Augmented reality;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Visualization;Silicon compounds;Three-dimensional displays","augmented reality;computer vision;mobile computing","mobile augmented reality;reusable component;flexible authoring solution;marker based augmented reality;mobile device;game engine;computer vision algorithm;custom visual editor;interactive pARabola plotting;Android OS","","1","","","","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter times for the development of different training-scenarios as well as reuse of existing designed engineering (math) models. This paper presents a newly developed virtual environment (VE) for training of procedure tasks i.e. object assembly. Unlike existing VE systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations of the real world. These physical constrains are imposed by the haptics devices in the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VE systems that are capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in cognitive learning and procedural skill development due to its high physically interactive nature. In addition a novel evaluation framework has also been proposed to evaluate system efficacy through a large scale of user-testing, which is often been neglected by design experts in the field of VEs. Results confirm the practical significance of evaluating a VE design by involving sample of real and representative users through the effective discovery of critical usability problems and system deficiencies. Results also indicate benefits of collecting multimodal information for accurate and comprehensive assessment of system efficacy. Evaluation results and improvement of existing design are also presented.","","978-1-4244-4217-1","10.1109/HAVE.2009.5356130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356130","Virtual environment;Training;User-ecntred evaluation;Performance;Perception;Memory","Virtual environment;Assembly systems;Industrial training;Haptic interfaces;Manufacturing industries;Costs;Usability;Computer aided manufacturing;Feedback;Intelligent manufacturing systems","assembling;computer based training;haptic interfaces;human factors;industrial training;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;virtual reality","virtual environment;object assembly training;virtual training systems;manufacturing industry;user interaction;haptics devices;user-testing;user-centered evaluation;cognitive learning;procedural skill development","","7","","16","","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical solutions to this problem include the use of potentially visible sets and occlusion culling, however, these solutions do not scale well, in time nor in memory, with the size of a virtual world. We propose a fast and inexpensive variant of occlusion culling tailored to a simple tiling scheme that improves scalability while maintaining very high performance. Tile visibilities are evaluated with hardware-accelerated occlusion queries, and in-tile rendering is rapidly computed using BVH instantiation and any visibility method, we use the CHC++ occlusion culling method for its good general performance. Tiles are instantiated only when tested locally for visibility, thus avoiding the need for a preconstructed global structure for the complete world. Our approach can render large-scale, diversified virtual worlds with complex geometry, such as cities or forests, all at high performance and with a modest memory footprint.","","978-1-4799-2576-6","10.1109/CADGraphics.2013.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814970","occlusion culling;visibility;procedural modeling;tiling;PVS;CHC++;BVH","Tiles;Three-dimensional displays;Rendering (computer graphics);Geometry;Prediction algorithms;Cities and towns;Coherence","rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;virtual reality","time coherent occlusion culling;space coherent occlusion culling;tileable extended 3D worlds;interactive large virtual world rendering;3D geometry;graphics hardware;simple tiling scheme;tile visibilities;hardware-accelerated occlusion queries;in-tile rendering;BVH instantiation;CHC++ occlusion culling method;complex geometry;memory footprint","","","","20","","15 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Load balancing in particular is a demanding task. If high efficiency is to be maintained, this task cannot be solved by a distributed operating system alone, but must involve the application programmer. Instead of the underlying message passing architecture being shielded from the programmer, it should be explicitly modeled. Three key concepts of a parallel operating system-dual, mobile and reactive objects-are presented. They provide simple but efficient mechanisms that can be easily utilized for such complex tasks as load balancing, i.e., initial placement and migration of application entities. To illustrate the applicability of these concepts, a simple VR application-geoview-was implemented on a message passing architecture, and serves as an example throughout the paper.","1060-3425","0-8186-7743-0","10.1109/HICSS.1997.667181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=667181","","Operating systems;Load management;Virtual reality;Computer architecture;Job shop scheduling;Processor scheduling;Pipelines;Geometry;Parallel programming;Programming profession","parallel programming;distributed memory systems;network operating systems;resource allocation;object-oriented programming;virtual reality;message passing","reactive objects;operating system support;load balancing parallel VR applications;distributed memory parallel machine;distributed operating system;application programmer;underlying message passing architecture;parallel operating system;mobile objects;dual objects;application entities;simple VR application;geoview;message passing architecture","","","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

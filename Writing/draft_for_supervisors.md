## Introduction
> to explain the premise of the proposed phd project

#### VR is a cool technology

Virtual Reality has become synonymous with the head mounted display technologies that allow individuals to receive and interact with computer generated stimuli.

Stereoscopic screens placed a few centimeters away from the eyes have presented scenes of rooftops

For training nurses, training pilots, practice and assessment of laparoscopic surgery, the education of chemistry and electrical engineering concepts and geography, as well as various sports

Since 1965 it has come a long way and is being used to do x, y, z (ie. dangerous situations)
> surgery, flight sim, military sim (Bossard, Kermarrec, Buche, & Tisseau, 2008 ; Holden, 2005)

Psychologists have been overjoyed at getting to study 'natural' behaviours (ie. do results gained in a lab actual reflect real world processes)

#### Two questions are outstanding
- Does it transfer
    - Without indication that tasks transfer, VR may not be an appropriate medium for training. This is of particular concern when we're using VR as a subtitute training environment for highly dangerous situations.
    - Adaptations may be tightly linked to the context that they were acquired in (Desmurget et al. 1997; Michel et al. 2007; Krakauer et al. 2000; Taylor and Ivry 2013)

> clearly state the research question

2 Research Themes that the studies proposed herein seek to address
- Can one transfer skills learnt in VR to Natural
- Remote research

> possibly state the specific aims here: These Research Themes beget specific questions


## Skill Learning Background
>  literature review for ToL

It has been assumed that ar and vr simulations foster motor learning (Sigrist et al., 2013b).


Some work has indicated that there is an equivalence in terms of complex skill learning between the real and simulated environments (Alicea, 2020), however Previous reviews have struggled to produce conclusive results due to the variation in sims and their components (Molier et al., 2010).


Transfer of learning from VR to natural has been assessed in knowledge transfer, conflict resolution, mathematics training
- dominated by skill training

Baseball (Gray, 2017), crane operation, car assembly.

Vast literature as simulators are widespread in their use
- the effectiveness of a sim is defined by its ability to teach skills that transfer to the real world (Gopher, 2012).


#### What is learning
Learning is typically defined as a relatively permanent change in a person’s capability to perform a skill (Schmidt & Lee, 2005).  

#### What is a skill?
I am defining skill by 1) something not known prior/something new, 2) able to be measured, 3) able to be improved through training (Adams, 1987)

#### Transfer of Learning
First law of psychology (Shepard, 1987)
The ability to learn in one context, and demonstrate what was learnt in a novel one is


Transfer of training can be defined as the gain (or loss) in the capability for performance of one task as a result of practice on some other task (Schmidt and Lee, 1982)

Theories of ToL
Behavioural (identical elements) which would support a non transfer?
Cognitive (schemas, information processing)
Situational/contextual (preparedness for future, cross-situational)


Which brings up the theories of generalization (the ability to apply learning
Generalization of learning: the degree to which a newly acquired skill can be produced with a (1) a new effector, (2) in a new workspace, (3) under new modes of movement. (Seidler, 2010)


To support ToL: (Boussad et al., 2008)
(1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classified according to what is learned;
(2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning;
(3) specific features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning;
(4) transfer can be used to assess a VE’s effectiveness; and
(5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning.

For the purposes of this report and ensuing research, “Virtual Reality” is defined by a computer generated environment that is delivered using a head mounted display unit, and the term “Natural” will be used to describe the “real world”.


#### Sports

> Gray, R. (2017). Transfer of training from virtual to real baseball batting. Front. Psychol. 8, 1–11. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02183

##### Gray (2017)
CAVE with the addition of a handheld actual bat (with tracking sensor attached) - Batters received visual, auditory, and tactile feedback during the movement and at the conclusion of their movement regarding the success of their swing

i) Adaptive training in a batting VE, (ii) extra sessions of batting practice in the VE, (iii) extra on-field sessions of real batting practice, and (iv) a control condition involving no additional training to the players’ regular practice.

pre-test (2x45min)x6 weeks | 2 weeks buffer post-test. Retention tests 1mo after post-test as well as a 5 year post experiment follow up which captured the progression of the player’s career and batting statistics
So it was a study that indicated adaptive training administered in a VE was the most effective training
the results can most likely be attributed to the fact that the training was designed in a way to challenge the players (it was stepwise) rather than because it was administered in VR

A 2010 study looked at the effect of VR with haptic feedback from movement on gait and balance, in stroke participants (Mirelman, et. al. 2010). The trainings for both groups consisted on 3 weekly, 1 hour sessions, for 4 weeks. Both groups received identical movement trainings based around dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, eversion, and combination movements; the non-VR group completed these movements at the instruction of a trainer whereas the VR group manipulated a virtually presented boat or plane towards a target. Results post analysis showed the VR group reporting greater improvement, and at faster rates, across multiple different measures. In all measures, the VR group showed significantly superior improvement, which was consistent with previous literature (Reid et. al., 2002; 2005; 2007).
follow up study using motion capture and a screen presentation
Mirelmen conducted a further study using a CAVE to investigate the efficacy of VR on gait training and motor learning in a Parkinson’s presenting population (Mirelman et. al., 2011). The study found a 31% improvement in all motor and gait tasks, and a significant improvement at specific tasks that were reported four times larger than the threshold for significance.
These results were persistent as found in a 1 month follow up.
VR was used by Bryanton and colleagues (2006) to assess the efficacy of using VR in motor rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. The use of the VE was to provide an engaging task, “gamifying” the rehabilitation to aid with rehabilitation protocol adherence, while also investigating the efficacy of VR to ensure exercise “correctness” which would allow for children to complete their rehabilitation at home, thus lower costs and barriers to accessing therapists.
Same rehab exercises
VRE reported more fun and higher interest/engagement
completion of the exercises with greater correctness (as determined by the length of time held in dorsiflexion)
VR participants reached a greater range of motion on average than the non-VR groups

#### the literature suports VR at home (for rehab) but can that be done with validity?
VEs that can be individualized—for example, by replicating the users’ home environment or modifying stimulus presentation according to user needs and capabilities—should enhance transfer and generalization of learning (Schultheis & Rizzo, 2001).

#### Sensorimotor/Visuomotor
(Anglin et al., 2017) Focused their investigation of sensorimotor learning by looking at visuomotor adaptation wherein a participant learns or “adapts” to a perturbation introduced by the experimenters in order to correctly perform a movement (Krakauer, 2009). Similar to how a sharp shooter will have to learn the rigged weighting of a carnival target practice game in order to win the prize.
The study had participants sitting at a desk viewing a computer screen in Virtual Reality and in Natural.
The study’s aims were to investigate a visuomotor adaptation and compare the strategies and adaptation acquired in VR compared with the same task in Natural.  
Implicit and explicit strategy and VR and Natural
Participants in both VR and Natural required the same time to adapt to the perturbation and reduce their errors for the task indicating that
Training block, baseline, rotation, block where participants did not receive visual feedback, then washout
n=24 (12 per group), participants were not requested to report on their previous VR experience
Hmd group felt difference with the quality of the interface statistically significant difference (p=0.064)
This will be discussed later

No significant difference in reaction time
No significant different in early or late adaption, or aftereffect (also called washout) which is the effect that having learnt the adaption has on a non-perturbed movement (similar to the colloquial experience of “sea-legs” after sailors return to land).

Anglin and colleagues found no significant difference in the pure performance of the task in that
The aiming angle was larger in the VR group compared to the natural group
The same target error

HMD-VR participants utilized a greater cognitive strategy than CT participants, and CT participants engaged in greater implicit learning than HMD-VR participants
Participants were able to adapt to perturbations in regardless of the medium
Suggested that the implicit adaptation acquired in VR may not generalize

Criticism of the  Anglin and Liew task
Habituation to VR
Mentioned this and how this may have contributed to the use of a cognitive or “explicit” strategy
Comfort may impact task performance
Visual acuity
IPD and contrast
Ocular dominance
Also just a computer screen task

The participants’ hand was represented by a series of white dots that indicated the hand path and by a red sphere 1cm in diameter which represented the finishing position of the participants’ pointing finger.

Verdicial or perturbed feedback

Perturbations increased by a stepwise function as this has been identified to create the most salient adaptation (Kagerer et al., 1997; Michel et al., 2007; Saijo & Gomi, 2010)

Baseline shows similar accuracy levels across each of the 3 dimensions tested (horizontal, sagittal, and vertical)
When the perturbation was introduced, subjects showed less adaptation to a vertical perturbation
More errors along the vertical axis

Gravity as a strong prior in VR/VEs (Jörges & López-Moliner, 2017; Lefrançois & Messier, 2019)


Most of the movements we do are 3D
Almost all previous studies assessing visuomotor adaptation and spatial generalization have used 2D tasks involving movements restricted to the horizontal plane. However, three-dimensional movements are biomechanically more complex than planar movements. They involve more degrees of freedom to be controlled as well as compensation for the gravitational force field which increases the proprioceptive processing demand.
A 3D skill means one must adapt and learn simultaneously across all three axes
Most studies focus on a perturbation along a single axis
This may be relevant due to postulation that adaptation to each axis is supported by separate neural mechanisms (Ghahramani & Wolpert, 1997; Krakauer et al., 2000; Messier & Kalaska, 1997, 1999; Soechting & Flanders, 1989)



### Outline the problem
> to provide evidence of project originality.


Despite the wealth of sim literature, research on modern virtual reality technologies is sparse

There is a wealth of historic and contemporary literature on non-HMD-VR that assess transfer of learning.
And yet HMDs are ubiquitous with vr training in industry  
- A Systematic Review was conducted (Analysis ongoing)
    - WIP: give numbers

The HMD literature is largely focused on rehabilitation applications
*Majority of literature in HMD-VR is focused on rehabilitation and has been conducted on impaired or non-normative populations.*
- stroke rehab
- DMD
- CP

And all of this literature is largely conflicting
- Assumed that VR is good enough
- But the literature is torn

A possible explanation for this is the
- differing technologies, differing tasks
- (Smith, 2019)

#### FIFA
A near parabolic or 'uncanny valley' due to simulator fidelity may explain some of the conflict. McMahan, R. P., Lai, C., & Pal, S. K. (2016). Interaction fidelity: The uncanny valley of virtual reality interactions. In International Conference on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality (pp. 59–70). Cham: Springer.


interaction fidelity—the objective degree of exactness with which real world actions are reproduced in an interactive system

Framework for Interaction Fidelity Analysis (FIFA), which can be used to assess the degree of interaction fidelity provided by a technique compared to a real-world action
First, biomechanical symmetry is used to analyze the anthropometrics, kinematics, and kinetics of an interaction technique.
Second, the input veracity of a technique concerns the accuracy, precision, and latency of the input devices used to implement it.
Finally, control symmetry represents the transfer functions that translate input data into meaningful system functions and simulation outcomes.

high-fidelity interaction techniques usually outperform mid-fidelity techniques

the second common result was that low-fidelity interaction techniques also usually outperform mid-fidelity techniques.

U-shaped curve in terms of user performance
Similar to the uncanny valley of robotics

A framework (based on McMahan et al. 2016) and will be included in the PhD project once analysis is complete.

> #### Transition
> to summarize that there are gaps in the literature and that the proposed work will be filling them in

Furthermore the assessment of VR and ToL lacks rigor (lacking matched control condition)
- There is existing literature on AR and VR technologies that assess learning when additional didactic material (such as instructional pop ups) have been added (Pletz et al. 2020).

It is widely accepted that haptic feedback, spatialized audio, and added pedagogical overlays improve learning in virtual reality (…, …) . However much in the same way that one could learn stoichiometry via a textbook, an experiment, or a podcast listened to while riding the tube; the setting itself has been demonstrated to affect the “learning” itself. I do not aim to answer why virtual reality may be better at teaching something such as chemistry, but the extent to which a task learnt in virtual reality compared to the same task being taught not in VR.

  - Why VR may be better
Technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) refers to the specific features of a technology that can be used to support pedagogical methods (Mishra & Koehler, 2006).
Affordances of virtual reality technologies to make motor learning better than reality (Levac & Sveistrup, 2014)


## Remote Research Background

It would be naive to present a transfer report on HMD-VR literature without noting the "unprescedented" times (either - https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1425138850012168196 or BoJo) in which this PhD is being completed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mass causality, insummountable suffering, and for those who are left; global devastation that we shall be reaping throughout our lifetime.

It is not a silver lining that 'humanity came together in support' and it would be irreverent at best to claim that the maladies caused by the pandemic ****

Open Science practices boomed and infrustrature rose to meet it (citation)

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychometric and *** experiments moved to online mediums (Tsay, …. …. ….)

Unlike its counterparts, virtual reality experiments were halted due to hardware requirements of such experiments (ie. needing a HMD), and the potential cross-contamination concerns of sharing physical lab equipment between subjects.

A number of papers have been published on the construct validity of using remote proxies for collecting movement data (eg. keyboard and mouse) (....., .....). However it is as yet unknown if the factors found in an ‘out of lab’ virtual reality environment would confound or impact the validity of experimental results.

Allow the examination of experimental bias from “in lab”, and how that bias may VR affect the results seen and published within our field.

The studies proposed aim to contribute insight into this question.

#### Also reiterate that the literature suports VR at home (for rehab) but can that be done with validity?
VEs that can be individualized—for example, by replicating the users’ home environment or modifying stimulus presentation according to user needs and capabilities—should enhance transfer and generalization of learning (Schultheis & Rizzo, 2001).


## Project Aims
> to clearly state the research questions and project aims

### Intro section

As a field we need to fill in the gaps in our understanding of this technology and its uses through rigourous scientific inquiry.

### Key questions
Research Theme 1: Can we transfer skills learnt in VR to Natural


Research Theme 2: Can HMD based virtual reality experiments be conducted remotely and be valid for research purposes.

* Did one learn?
* Did one improve across trainings?
* What other behaviours are affected by those improvements (generalization)
* Can those improvements be observed in environments other than the one they were made in? (transfer)
* How long did those improvements last?


### How I plan to answer these questions
> to outline the experimental plan before getting into methods

A 3 phase plan to address the above questions.

Study 1 aims to assess transfer of learning by comparing performance and learning rates between VR in Natural laboratory settings on a novel task. The specific questions and hypotheses are below
*

Study 2 assesses the impact training 'at home in VR' has on performance. The specific questions and hypotheses are below
*



Study 3 will directly compare VR settings (either at home or in the lab) on task performance and outcome. As with above, the specific questions and hypotheses for study 3 are below:

- H0: the setting of the VR experiments has no impact on task performance and results
- H1: the setting has a statistically relevant impact on task performance and outcome

# Methods

## Introduction
> to set up the section (ie. explain what is included) and to give rationale for own study design

The following section addresses the methodology proposed for the project separated into sections related to subjects, experimental design, materials, measures, and proposed analyses.

These sections address the "high level" methodology of the project and contains further background and rationale for the chosen methods.



## Methodology
> explanation of what will be done and justification for why it was chosen
> **BIG EMPHASIS on justification**

### Subjects

Screening screening questionnaire to capture demographic information (age, sex, education level), previous experience with VR, gaming habits, and and previous exposure to maze game paradigms. Exclusion criteria for the study includes subjects who have self-reported risk of epilepsy, visual impairments, and who partook in recreational drug use at the time of testing.

A self-report questionaire (pre-experiment) will be administered to assess mental status and will contain  measures of restedness, sleep quality, alcohol and drug use.

Post-session questionnaires will be used to capture information regarding session performance and will include measures of simulator sickness (SSQ), self-perception of performance, if the participant is rushed or operating on a time limit
- noticed anything weird
- qualitative experience
- presence

A further open ended qualitative question will be asked
- code qualitative
This will provide qualitative data on perceived differences between the VR and Natural task


### Recruitment strategy
Participant recruitment will have two phases, one for lab setting and one for remote setting.

Lab or 'in person' participants will be recruited from the University of Leeds School of Psychology, School of Engineering, School of Computing, Center for Immersive Technologies, and the Extended Reality Society. Undergraduate Psychology students recieve course credit for experimental participation and it is therefore expected for those students to represent the greatest portion of participants.

Remote or 'at home' participants will also use the aforementioned recruitment channels with the addition of virtual VR communities such as The Virtual World Society, Circuit Stream, ARVR Women & Allies, ARVRinEDU, VREducatorsSpatial Network, and Side Quest will be used for recruitment.  



### Group Assignment

#### Blinding
The studies will not be traditionally blinded as participants would be aware of the paradigm they were being tested on (i.e. in a HMD or Natural), although participants will not be informed of other groupings across the studies.

#### Matched groups
VR experience
Demographics (based on the screening questionaire)


#### Sample Size
Current group size is based on the effect size of ***** (citation, citation, citation).
This may require adjustment after pilot data is collected (see Gantt chart for information).
(Crochet et al., 2011) The choice of at least 10 subjects per group was based on a 2-tailed test, with α = 0.05 and power (1 – β) = 0.80, and an intended reduction of 30% in time taken to complete tasks for intervention versus control groups, based on data from previous studies of VR simulations for skill learning

### Training Schedule
Training schedules for skill learning (ie. how many sessions, for how long, at what difficulty) is a wicked problem (Rittel & Webber, 1973). No consensus on training schedules despite extensive literature (Kassite et al., 2019) and How training should be structured to maximize learning is still under debate (Guadagnoli and Lee, 2004).

More practice trials, better learning (although there is a plateau) aka. Law of Practice (Schmidt & Lee, 2011)


#### Distributed trainings are best in one study (Yanovich & Ronen. 2015).

These studies were done using two main V.R. systems designed for motor learning: Timocco and IREX
Timocco is an interactive and motion based computer game for children with difficulties in motor control and cognitive skills, used in clinics, schools, and at home
Gesture Tek’s Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX®) uses immersive video gesture control technology to place patients into virtual sport or gaming environments, where they are guided through clinician- prescribed therapeutic exercise regimes. Clinicians can design a fun and interactive exercise program that tests single joints, combined joint movements, or full body function

Study 1
bi-lateral transfer in the upper limbs
n=18
Inflate balloons
3 sessions (task explainer, task practice, task assessment)
The control group did a non-related motor task (kicking a rubber ball with two feet while sitting) while the test group received training on the specific task using their dominant limb.

Study 2
Intrinsic vs extrinsic attention (pay attention to body and movement sensation vs pay attention to the objects on the screen)
Two days separated the training and the test (first learning task, then a training + higher difficulty)

n=16 were randomly assigned to one of the groups (massed or distributed).The study was done in 5 sessions, taking place on two separate days. The purpose of the game was to juggle balls. The first session included 2 trials of 45 seconds at level 5. Based on the success rate of these trials the partici-pants were assigned to one of the two groups, in order to create equal groups at the baseline. In the second ses-sion the massed practice group preformed 7 sets of 45 seconds, separated by 15 seconds of rest at level 5. The Distributed Practice group preformed 7 sets of 45 seconds separated by 15 seconds of rest followed by 30 seconds of “snowboard” practice and 15 second of rest at level 5. On day two the massed practice group per-formed the same protocol of training as on day one, then the group preformed 2 trials of 45 seconds at level 5 and a test of 2 trials of 45 seconds at level 7.Participants in the Distributed Practice group preformed the same protocol of training as day one. Then the group preformed 2 trials of 45 seconds at level 5 and a test of 2 trials of 45 seconds at level 7.

It has been suggested that extinction after a novel motor learning task occurs between 48-72 hours (Kozlowski, James & Schallert, 1996), however ‘skill based’ learning can occur if tasks are repeated within a 5-day paradigm (Pascual-Leone et. al., 1995).


The proposed schedule was informed by the review of laparoscopic surgery and dental training simulators due to their motor skill components being similarly matched in terms of degrees of freedom, ergonomic load (hand held while standing), multi-session, and in their use as an assessor for transfer of training.

Look to laparoscopic surgery training schedule
To inform training protocol

### Session Delivery

Each session will be separated into 3 sections; introduction and set up, task data collection, and close out. Each study has a variation of tasks in each section, please refer to the specific study designs in section *** for more detail.



No more than 24 minutes which is the recommended time
Fatigue caused by ergonomic load (citation), and simulator sickness (citation)

The first session all participants in the VR groups will complete Oculus’ “First Encounter” in order to familiarize subjects with a VRE and the controls.




## Materials

> this is important because the smallest thing going wrong might confound results
> [Craig, Bastian, & Montagne, 2011](https://scite.ai/reports/how-information-guides-movement-intercepting-MMZbY9)

### Hardware
> Unsure if rift or quest is best. I think Quest due to the tracking and there are more quests in use than rifts. If using Quest then will need to do online DB and bake the lighting.
> An Oculus Rift with touch controllers supported by a 2017 Razer laptop running Windows 10 will be used for all 'in lab' experimentation.

> An Oculus Quest will be used for all VR based sessions.

(see Section ** for additional considerations)


#### Haptics
> Resources
> https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JMBR.40.6.545-557
> Haptic feedback (in VR) has been demonstrated to improve performance
>Surgery (Kim et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2015; Panait et al., 2009) & Movement (Weller & Zachmann, 2012)


Haptics are important (citation, citation)
Questionnaires during pilot testing will collect qualitative data on perceived differences in haptic feedback quality
Citation, citation, citation indicates that the proposed use of built-in haptics from the existing VR controllers is good enough
low latency haptic feedback which was triggered by the ball hitting a VR maze wall to simulate the force feedback participants received in Natural
Force testing is not feasible in the given timeframe (nor is the required hardware available to the student) and is an avenue for further research

#### Mazes
Laser-cut mazes out of MDF
Example specs in appendix
Beta testers will be used pre-pilot testing to ensure appropriate difficulty. This was determined such that a beta tester with no previous maze experience should not be able to solve the maze in under 5 minutes, and no more than 5 solves in a 12 minute time period.

At home
Laser cut separator with slots compatible with either the right or left controller to ensure correct controller placement


#### Spatialized Audio
Audio feedback important for learning (citation, citation, citation)
Spatialized audio is super super important in VR (citation, citation, citation)
Spatialized audio cues will be given for the ball hitting the wall, ambient room
Delivered via the built in speakers
Designed and coded using Dolby (citation, citation, citation)





#### Software
Unity 2019.4

##### Physics simulator
Current VR research on sensorimotor adaptation uses the inbuilt physics engines of Unity or Unreal Engine (the two main commercial platforms used for VR development). I will use the same
If pilot data (qualitative survey responses and physics simulation benchmarking) indicates that the OTS physics engines are not sufficient, a custom physics engine was built for similar ‘marble maze’ experimentation by the author in 2017 and checked against similar materials (plywood, metal, glass, and acrylic). This engine can be updated to the current software standards and used as a better alternative to Unity’s physics simulator.
It is out of project scope to create a novel physics engine for the purposes of the proposed research.

### Measures

#### Task Performance Data
Number of attempts
Successful completions
Time to successful completion
Number, time, and location of error (errors defined by the ball falling in a hole).
Controller movement tracking (x, y, z)
Ball movement tracking
Path taken
Velocity
Acceleration

The ball movement tracking will support investigation into the path taken, velocity and acceleration, and ‘rests’ (ie. a participant uses a mazewall to rest the ball against before moving) which will provide data on rests taken, total rest time, and location of rests.


In VR these measures will be collected via software variables (Unity)

> In Natural three options:
> - Camera set up
> - Deep Lab Cut
> - Alternatively custom ball
3d printed
Coat
Milling two half spheres, add components
polymer resin and grind the outside to smooth


#### Participation Data
Questionnaires Pre-experiment:
- Demographic
- Mental status

Questionnaires Post-experiment:
- adapted SSQ
- percieved improvement rating
- noticed anything weird
- qualitative experience
- presence
- interview


### Analysis
A Welch t-test will be used to assess the variance between groups.

Bayes factor (evidence favors the alt vs evidence favors the null)

Graphical analysis of a learning curve (Ramsay, et al., 2001)
- regression analyses to fit a curve. Additional 'analysis of best fit' may be prudent, accordingly stepwise and exponentials models may also be used during analysis.

## Feasibility Assessment.
> to outline the barriers to data collection and to indicate that you have thought out the feasibility of the proposed plan
> to outline how I plan to execute on this plan



It is important to address the risks and barriers associated with a project that proposes the collection of new data. The following section details the barriers this project may face as well as the plans to mitigate identifed risks.
> Equipment (e.g. hardware and software), COVID-19 planning (risk assessment and contingency plans), Resource Allocation (time, compensation, )  Data Collection Barriers,

### Equipment
There are several concerns when using hardware and software
- Project feasibility and risk mitigation has been informed by a duFMEA (Stamatis, 2003) (appendix ***)
- such as failure in tracking (Deutsch et al., 2011)
    - Deutsch, J. E., Brettler, A., Smith, C., Welsh, J., John, R., Guarrera-Bowlby, P., et al. (2011). Nintendo Wii sports and Wii fi t game analysis, validation, and application to stroke rehabilitation. Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, 18 (6), 701–719.


### Experimental Design
> novel experiment (construct validity)
> Note: it will be critical to control variables ie. errors should not be coming from person, should be coming from the medium

> attrition

In addition to the above methodological design, it is important to address attrition rates when proposing multi-session human experimentation.

To mitigate the risk of participants forgetting session sign up email reminders will be sent the day before, morning of, and an hour prior.

In accordance with GDPR, permission will be requested for email contact of the participants. These email records will be stored for either 3 years, or until the completion of this student’s PhD (whichever happens first).

 If the participant does not wish for their email to be used, a confirmation of session time with be given verbally and in writing to the participant at the conclusion of each session
- e.g. "Your next session is Tuesday, the 31st of August at 8am."

As discussed in Section *** the estimated participant recruiment minimum to see an effect is ** (maybe 15).
- Budgeting for attrition rates during recruitment (ie. recruiting more participants than needed to meet the minimum sample size to find an effect)


>Task choice/Engagement

- A maze provides engagement, difficult but solvable with a defined goal (good for ‘flow’ (citation, citation)

Historically based motor learning tasks (such as cursor representation during a center-out-reach) have been used to examine motor learning strategies in VR (citation, citation, citation) and it is apparent from systematic literature reviews that there is a need for methodical rigor in this field (smith, motor, levac, m-thingy, mine, citation). Traditional reach experiments used by citation, citation, citation would not win in a war of attrition.

Compensation for Participation
- RPP
- Monetary compensation based on time spent at standard rate
- time

### COVID-19
> (risk assessment and contingency plans)
> SOP for hardware and lab cleaning
> remote research


VR research has ground to a halt at Leeds due to the pandemic. This is both due to safety concerns over space (ie. physical lab rooms), hardware (ie. decontamination between users), and the safety concerns over having a PGR experimenter interfacing with multiple participants across the length of a study.

The following contingency plans have been developed to address the ever-evolving status of the COVID-19 pandemic.


### Resource Allocation

The time and resources required to complete the proposed experiments is the greatest feasibility concern
> Use this section to reiterate the need for insight into feasibility of remote data collection for VR research (which will reduce hours spent in lab testing)
> time estimation

## Discussion

[Dalgarno & Lee, 2009 ](https://scite.ai/reports/what-are-the-learning-affordances-4wWDGa)


Previous studies have assessed the TPK that VR offers
VR may be better suited to learning because it does

A larger discussion of these will be explored in the dissertation
- summarize and cite pages 6-10 of [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyOijZIS5RUbcm3W4wrFZMNGcdRgURh1YiZW61UHPWQ/edit#)


What is needed to learn a skill (strictly come -> deaf)

Is it logical to assume that we would acquire skills using the same mechanisms, or is it inane to assume such owing to the fact that virtual reality is not, in fact, reality
- [pages 10 - 12 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyOijZIS5RUbcm3W4wrFZMNGcdRgURh1YiZW61UHPWQ/edit#)

### Implications
- using marble maze (this task) for ML robotic motor learning

- fills in gaps

- supports so much future work in VR
- knowing what the differences are btwen VR in lab and remote

For skill-based tracking tasks, it is known that the adopted human operator dynamics can be modeled accurately with multimodal human operator models. In this paper, estimated human operator model parameters are used to explicitly quantify the changes that occur in the operator's use of visual and motion feedback during skill-acquisition and transfer. A quasi-transfer-of-training experiment is described, in which inexperienced participants were trained to perform an aircraft pitch attitude tracking task, either in a fixed-base or in moving-base simulator environment. After the training phase, the participants were transferred to the other simulator setting, to reveal possible transfer effects. Preliminary results from one participant in each experiment group indicate that the fitted models are successful in revealing the changes that occur in the multimodal manual control characteristics of the participants, and show that convergence to a final skill-based control strategy requires significant training. Furthermore, the presented results suggest that there might be limited direct transfer from training in a fixed-base environment to a moving-base environment.","1062-922X","978-1-4799-3840-7","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974409","","Training;Visualization;Tracking;Dynamics;Human factors;Delays;Atmospheric measurements","aerospace computing;aircraft control;attitude control;computer based training;control engineering computing;digital simulation","simulator-based training;skill-based manual control behavior;multimodal human operator models;skill-based tracking tasks;human operator dynamics;visual feedback;motion feedback;skill-acquisition;quasitransfer-of-training experiment;aircraft pitch attitude tracking task;fixed-base simulator environment;moving-base simulator environment","","2","","13","","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advantages of the HMD include interacting with the simulation in a more natural manner as compared to using a large-screen immersive display due to the similarities between the interactions afforded in the virtual compared to the real-world task. Suspending the laws of physics may have an effect on usability and in turn could affect learning outcomes. Our dependent variables consisted of a pre and post cognition questionnaire, quantitative performance measures, perceived workload and system usefulness, and a psychomotor assessment to measure to what extent transfer of learning took place from the virtual to the real world.

"Radiance coming from shaded areas in urban scene","C. Miesch; X. Briottet","ONERA-CERT, Toulouse, France; NA","IEEE/ISPRS Joint Workshop on Remote Sensing and Data Fusion over Urban Areas (Cat. No.01EX482)","6 Aug 2002","2001","","","207","211","This paper is devoted to the analysis of the signal that is measured by optical remote sensors when they acquired data over a shaded part of an urban scene. For such a target, the signal is much lower than for others, as there is no direct downward irradiance. In this work, a simple urban scene is considered that introduces a shaded area. The signal observed by a high spatial resolution satellite sensor over a normal panchromatic band (500-700 nm) is computed thanks to an adapted radiative transfer code (AMARTIS) able to deal with ground topography and heterogeneity. The signal is analyzed and it appears that environmental effects play a significant role. Moreover, because of the scattering effects happening for shorter wavelengths, it is also shown that a widening of the band against 440 nm improves by about 10% the difference of signal coming from two different ground types (for whose the difference of reflectance is constant and equal to 0.1). This demonstrates that widening may be beneficial to observations in shadow because of scattering effects mainly. A more realistic scene is also considered, each part of which is associated with realistic spectral behavior. This latter simulation simply shows the importance of the thematic in the choice of the band, as it is determinant to the relevancy or the widening.","","0-7803-7059-7","10.1109/DFUA.2001.985881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985881","","Layout;Mie scattering;Optical scattering;Atmospheric modeling;Signal analysis;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Urban areas;Instruments;Atmospheric waves","radiative transfer;remote sensing;spectral analysis","radiance;shaded areas;urban scene;panchromatic band;adapted radiative transfer code;AMARTIS;ground topography;heterogeneity;environmental effects;ground types;scattering effects;spectral behavior","","1","","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years the idea of using video game technology in surgical education for laparoscopy has also been explored, however few have attempted to make a connection between video game experience and robotic surgical skills. Thus, the current study aims to examine the performance of video gamers in a virtual reality robotic surgery simulator. Furthermore, the video gamers' performance was compared to that of medical students, expert robotic surgeons, and “laypeople.” The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that video gamers acquire perceptual and psychomotor skills through video game play, similar to those used by robotic surgeons. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and performed three computer-based perceptual tests: a Flanker compatibility task, a subsidizing task, and a Multiple Object Tracking test. Participants then performed two warm-up exercises and eight trials of two core exercises on a robotic surgery simulator. After completing all trials, participants completed a post-questionnaire regarding their experience with the system. Expert video gamers (n=40), medical students (n=24), laypeople (n=42) and expert robotic surgeons (n=16) were recruited. Medical students and gamers were significantly faster than experts in the Flanker Task. The experts were significantly slower than the all other groups in the subsidizing task. Experts scored significantly higher, were significantly more efficient, and were significantly faster than laypeople, medical students, and gamers in the first trial of Ring & Rail 1 and Suture Sponge. In trial eight of the simulation exercises, the experts performed significantly better than most groups in all of the metrics. Contrary to prior literature in laparoscopy, this study was unable to validate enhanced abilities of video gamers in a robotic surgery simulator. This study does further demonstrate that the transfer of skills developed through video game play is relevant to the surgical technique. This may be due to the differences of the systems and how the users interact within them. In a society where video games have become an integral past time, it is important to determine the role that video games play in the perceptual and psychomotor development of users. These findings can be generalized to domains outside of medicine that utilize robotic and computer-controlled systems, speaking to the scope of the gamers' abilities and pointing to the capacity within these systems.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586262","","Surgery;Robots;Measurement;Games;Training;Rails;Cameras","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational robots;human-robot interaction;medical computing;medical robotics;surgery;virtual reality","video game experience;basic robotic skills;virtual reality robotic surgery simulator;standardized robotic surgery skill training;objective robotic surgery skill training;standardized robotic surgery skill assessment;objective robotic surgery skill assessment;surgical education;laparoscopy;video game technology;perceptual skill acquisition;psychomotor skill acquisition;computer-based perceptual tests;flanker compatibility task;subsidizing task;multiple object tracking test;computer-controlled systems","","1","","17","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on field identification, five palm tree classes were considered: dead, severely attacked, attacked-untreated, attacked-treated; and healthy trees. Spectral measurements were acquired over each sample using Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD). They were resampled and convolved using WV-3 spectral response profiles and the Canadian radiative transfer code (CAM5S). Results showed that the indices NDWI, SRWI, SIWSI-1, SIWSI-2 and NDII are sensitive to palm trees water agitation caused by RPW attacks. They discriminated among the considered classes with excellent R2 values (≈ 95%) using second order polynomial function (p <; 0.05). Nevertheless, they express the water content dynamic range about only 10% to 55%. New Palm Tree Water Stress Index (PTWSI) were proposed using WV-3 SWIR bands. They differentiated among the considered classes with R2 of 90%, and enhanced significantly water content dynamic range for a maximum about 90% or 100%.

The method is founded on a simulator of brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere. The simulator is based on microwave sea emissivity and scattering model functions, derived from the outputs of the SEAWIND software, which implements a two-scale microwave sea surface model and a radiative transfer scheme in a nonscattering atmosphere. The development of the model functions aims to reduce the SEAWIND computational time, still maintaining its sensitivity to the main geophysical variables. Different adaptations of the simulation model have been performed to better reproduce the radiometric data in the region of interest. A comparison between the simulations and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) observations acquired throughout year 2000 over the Mediterranean Sea has permitted us to refine the model functions as well as to assess the whole simulation procedure. As for the inversion problem, a regression analysis has been applied to two different synthetic datasets to retrieve integrated precipitable water vapor, liquid water path and wind speed. The first dataset simulates the observations of SSM/I, whilst the second one concerns the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Both have been generated by using the ECMWF atmospheric profiles and the measurements of the SeaWinds scatterometer aboard QuickSCAT. The SSM/I data have been used to carry out a statistical validation of the estimators. AMSR-E observations of a Tramontane-Mistral event, typical of the Mediterranean Sea, have been analyzed to evaluate the benefits of its expanded channel capability.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.859340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564398","Cloud liquid;sea and atmospheric remote sensing;sea wind velocity;spaceborne microwave radiometry;water vapor","Sea surface;Satellite broadcasting;Radiometers;Atmospheric modeling;Ocean temperature;Computational modeling;Microwave radiometry;Atmospheric measurements;Geophysical measurements;Sea measurements","oceanographic techniques;oceanographic regions;atmospheric techniques;data acquisition;radiometry;atmospheric humidity;wind;remote sensing;microwave measurement;inverse problems","atmospheric parameter retrieval;surface parameter retrieval;satellite microwave radiometer;Mediterranean Sea;microwave radiometric measurement;brightness temperature simulator;microwave sea emissivity;scattering model function;SEAWIND software;microwave sea surface model;radiative transfer;radiometric data reproduction;Special Sensor Microwave/Imager;AD 2000;inversion problem;regression analysis;precipitable water vapor;liquid water path;wind speed;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System;AMSR-E;ECMWF atmospheric profile;Sea Winds scatterometer;QuickSCAT;statistical validation;Tramontane-Mistral event;sea remote sensing;atmospheric remote sensing","","7","","38","","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SC algorithm relies on the concept of atmospheric functions (AFs) which are dependent on atmospheric transmissivity and upwelling and downwelling atmospheric radiances. These AFs are fitted versus the atmospheric water vapor content for operational purposes. In this paper, we present updated fits using MODTRAN 4 radiative transfer code, and we also extend the application of the SC algorithm to the TIR channel of the TM sensor onboard the Landsat-4 platform and the enhanced TM plus sensor onboard the Landsat-7 platform. Five different atmospheric sounding databases have been considered to create simulated data used for retrieving AFs and to test the algorithm. The test from independent simulated data provided root mean square error (rmse) values below 1 K in most cases when atmospheric water vapor content is lower than 2 g middotcm-2. For values higher than 3 g middotcm-2, errors are not acceptable, as what occurs with other SC algorithms. Results were also tested using a land surface temperature map obtained from one Landsat-5 image acquired over an agricultural area using inversion of the radiative transfer equation and the atmospheric profile measured in situ at the sensor overpass time.

Acquisition of field data has several constraints, including lack of a suitable airborne sensor system. Development and evaluation of algorithms requires detailed and accurate radiometric data, which have to be collected in a very short time to limit noise due to the temporal variability of surface temperature controlled by the local heat balance within the canopy. Several canopy properties have to be determined, e.g. leaf area index (LAI), leaf inclination distribution, in addition to soil and foliage temperature. A data set for validation studies should comprise a range of canopies and canopy conditions. We have coped with these difficulties by using a detailed radiative transfer model (CUPID) of the soil-plant--atmosphere system to produce synthetic data sets over a wide range of canopies and hydro-meteorological conditions. These data have been first used to assess the sensitivity of the anisotropy in TIR radiance to LAI and to the soil water content. It was shown that a dry top soil and a wet root zone imply that the brightness temperature is highest at nadir viewing, opposite to the condition with a wet top soil and a drier root zone. The relative magnitude of the directional change in surface temperature compared with the difference between soil and foliage temperature was evaluated in detail over a range of LAI values. Next, the radiance data base created by RT modeling was used to produce realistic complex scenes. Land cover of a complex, irrigated agriculture scene was mapped beforehand using a TM image.","","0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1024934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024934","","Layout;Temperature distribution;Land surface temperature;Soil measurements;Sensor systems;Radiometry;Temperature sensors;Radio control;Temperature control;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","geophysical techniques;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;atmospheric radiation","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;remote sensing;IR radiometry;thermal infrared;TIR;radiative transfer;model;soil vegetation atmosphere system;soil;vegetation mapping;atmosphere;Leaf Inclination Distribution;temperature;validation;soil water content;LAI;simulation;complex scene;soil moisture;leaf area index","","2","","5","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today's urban regions serve as an excellent example of such systems. People and institutions confront the implications of the increasing scale of information becoming available due to a combination of advances in pervasive computing, data acquisition systems as well as high performance computing. Integrated modeling and decision making environments are necessary to support planning, analysis and counter factual experiments to study these complex systems. Here, we describe SIMFRASTRUCTURE - a flexible coordination middleware that supports high performance computing oriented decision and analytics environments to study socially coupled systems. Simfrastructure provides a multiplexing mechanism by which simple and intuitive user-interfaces can be plugged in as front-end systems, and high-end computing resources can be plugged in as back-end systems for execution. This makes the computational complexity of the simulations completely transparent to the users. The decoupling of user interfaces and data repository from simulation execution allows users to access simulation results asynchronously and enables them to add new datasets and simulation models dynamically. Simfrastructure enables implementation of a simple yet powerful modeling environment with built-in analytics-as-a service platform, which provides seamless access to high end computational resources, through an intuitive interface for studying socially coupled systems. We illustrate the applicability of Simfrastructure in the context of an integrated modeling environment to study public health epidemiology.","","978-0-7695-4996-5","10.1109/CCGrid.2013.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546132","Socially coupled systems;middleware;public health epidemiology;distributed systems;software architecture","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data models;Libraries;Data transfer;Middleware;Analytical models","computational complexity;data acquisition;decision making;digital simulation;health care;middleware;parallel processing;socio-economic effects;ubiquitous computing;user interfaces","Simfrastructure;flexible middleware platform;adaptable middleware platform;socially coupled system modeling;socially coupled system analysis;interdependent networks;social networks;organizational networks;economic networks;infrastructure networks;physical networks;pervasive computing;data acquisition systems;high performance computing;decision making;integrated modeling environments;flexible coordination middleware;multiplexing mechanism;intuitive user interfaces;front-end systems;high-end computing resources;back-end systems;computational complexity;data repository;simulation execution;built-in analytics-as-a-service platform;high end computational resource access;public health epidemiology","","3","","24","","24 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and combined optical indices showed similar trends for both PROSPECT-SAILH simulated data and ground measured datasets. The dataset used showed that crop type had a clear influence on the establishment of predictive equations as well as on their validation.

ABI patients usually stop receiving cognitive treatment when leaving the rehabilitation facility or shortly thereafter, due to the high cost of therapy sessions and the mobility requirement to access therapy. Software solutions offer a promising tool for accessible and affordable cognitive rehabilitation in the home environment. However, research provides limited evidence for effective transfer of benefits from computerized cognitive training to real-life functions. Virtual reality (VR) exergames using motion-interaction offer a more realistic and natural training environment, and are therefore expected to facilitate a more effective transfer. Although commercial exergames may bring about some cognitive gains, they usually do not target cognitive functions directly. Here we describe a novel exergames platform, the Active Brain Trainer (ABT), designed to directly target EF, using games in multiple realistic contexts. The software adapts in real-time to the patient's behavior, providing feedback and rewards, and hence may enhance usability and compliance. The primary goal of the current study is to assess the feasibly and acceptability of this platform for community-dwelling ABI patients during the chronic phase. A secondary goal is to assess the initial efficacy on EF and functional benefits from program training. Participants were instructed to use the games for 15-20 sessions. Neuropsychological assessments of EF and daily life functions were performed before and after training. Participants also filled a satisfaction questionnaire following training. All training and assessments were conducted in the participants' homes. Game performance was recorded throughout training sessions. Preliminary results from the six ABI patients who successfully completed the program so far show no adverse effects. Participants reported enjoyment and satisfaction from training. Participants performed increasingly more challenging EF tasks within game environments. Initial results show improvements in functional tasks and most executive neuropsychological assessments following training. Additional participants are currently being trained to increase the power of the results. These preliminary findings support the feasibility and potential efficacy of the motion-based cognitive training of EF for community-dwelling individuals with ABI.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007530","cognitive training;exergames;motion-based;acquired brain injury;community-dwelling;executive functions","Games;Training;Avatars;Radiation detectors;Brain injuries;Medical treatment;Atmospheric measurements","brain;cognition;computer games;injuries;medical computing;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","motion-based virtual reality cognitive training;executive functions;acquired brain injury community-dwelling individuals;ABI;long-term cognitive disability;rehabilitation facility;therapy sessions;mobility requirement;home environment;computerized cognitive training;VR exergames;motion interaction;active brain trainer;ABT;chronic phase;neuropsychological assessments;daily life functions;game environments;functional tasks","","","","69","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subsequently, although the time efficiency of test based on computer has improved, disadvantages have remained, for those tests being too tedious to attract the interest of individuals and being restricted by the content and the type. In this study, a combination of virtual reality, eye tracking, and electroencephalogram (EEG) signal acquisition technologies was used to conduct diagnostic assessment and testing on patients with ADHD. Selective attention, sustained attention, abstract reasoning, and cognitive transfer abilities were evaluated by performing visual and auditory continuous performance test (CPT) and the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) in a 3D virtual classroom with optional distraction factors.

Several factors constrain the development of a true intelligent autonomous machine. The acquisition of expert knowledge continues to hinder progress. Knowledge acquisition techniques have reduced the effort involved in acquiring knowledge from an expert and representing it in a form that can be used by the computer. Most, however, focus on the gathering and representation of one class of knowledge. Two major categories of expertise makeup most of the expert's knowledge: explicit knowledge which is easy to articulate, and implicit knowledge such as intuition and judgment. It is in the nature of implicit knowledge that makes it difficult to clearly define and acquire from experts. Most current approaches learn only the expert explicit knowledge via query sessions and ignore the implicit expertise altogether. Humans, on the other hand, continually learn and apply both types of knowledge. Humans typically learn the implicit knowledge by observing others handle real-life situations and by adapting what they observed to handle new situations. This research aims to answer the following question: How does one implement learning by observation such that implicit knowledge can be acquired, represented, and reused? It focuses on capturing and modeling the implicit knowledge that is commonly applied by experts while they deal with dynamic real-life situations.

This is unlike 'loose coupling' which uses simple file transfers between modules, and 'tight coupling' which uses a single language for implementation. KEMS runs on PC 286 and 386 systems under MS DOS. An important reason for targetting onto these machines is the desire to make simulation tools available to a range of users at widely differing sites. The concepts within the prototype software are being evaluated using process models for gas distribution and control supplied by British Gas. The knowledge-acquisition front-end is being used to increase the model repertoire, and is itself being evaluated for use by engineers. Further knowledge-based tools which are to be added include an expert system adviser for simulation (to aid novice users), and model validation aids. The overall aim is to make complex modelling and simulation methodologies accessible to a much wider range of engineers and other users than is currently achievable.<>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=198639","","Simulation;Computer aided engineering;Expert systems","digital simulation;engineering computing;expert systems","PC 386;industrially-motivated knowledge-based environment;modelling;software components;KEMS;medium coupling;PC 286;MS DOS;simulation tools;process models;gas distribution;British Gas;knowledge-acquisition front-end;expert system adviser;model validation aids","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The findings of this study are that there are 6 studies showing transfer of skill for VR to in-vivo However more studies assessing efficacy and transfer validity are required to conclusively quantify the transfer validity of VR orthopaedic simulators.

The system can reproduce not only sound sources but also sound reflection and insulation, so that the trainee can learn both sound location and obstacle perception skills. The virtual training environment is described in extensible markup language (XML), and the O&M instructor can edit it easily according to the training curriculum. Evaluation experiments were conducted to test the efficiency of some features of the system. Thirty subjects who had not acquired O&M skills attended the experiments. The subjects were separated into three groups: a no-training group, a virtual-training group using the present system, and a real-training group in real environments. The results suggested that virtual-training can reduce “veering” more than real-training and also can reduce stress as much as real training.

While it is known that humans can transfer non-visual spatial knowledge between real and virtual environments, limitations of these studies typically include results obtained mainly in simple environments, using mainly blindfolded-sighted participants and different methods of sensory input for real and virtual environments. In this study, participants with a wide range of visual experience use the EyeCane and Virtual EyeCane to solve complex Hebb-Williams mazes in real and virtual environments. The EyeCane and its virtual counterpart are minimalistic sensory substitution devices that code single-point distance information into sound. We test whether participants improve performance in the real-to-virtual sequence: solve a real maze and subsequently improve performance in the virtual maze. We also test whether participants can sole a virtual maze and subsequently improve performance in the virtual world: the virtual-to-real sequence. We find that participants can use sensory substitution guided navigation to extract spatial information from the virtual world and apply it to significantly improve their behavioral performance in the real world and vice versa.

The nonstationary imaging properties of the collimator are simulated using the generalized collimator transfer function; thereby avoiding the unrealistic approximations for camera response. The body is approximated as a cylinder having constant attenuation, and the source distribution is approximated as a summation of many 3-D Gaussian functions having different source strengths, center points, and widths. The camera trajectory is specified at each imaging position by the center of the camera crystal and an orthogonal matrix that determines the camera orientation. The constant attenuation, Gaussian sources, and generalized collimator transfer function combine to produce an analytic expression for the image intensity in each pixel. Poisson statistics are then used to simulate realistic SPECT images.

Detailed ground truth data obtained during this experiment have been used to compute the additional radiation due to scattering and emission by the vegetation components. The preliminary model predictions are in good agreement with the data and they give quantitative understanding for the influence of the first order scattering within the canopy on the radiometer brightness temperature. The model results using tree ground truth show that the scattering term is significant for trees and that the tau-omega model needs modification to account for additional scattering contribution. Numerical simulations also indicate that the single scattered radiation increases the canopy brightness temperature considerably. These simulations show that the scattering term has a negligible dependence on soil moisture and is only function of angle and polarization.","2153-7003","978-1-4244-3394-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5417758","Forest;soil moisture;microwave radiometry;radiative transfer theory;scattering","Microwave radiometry;Scattering;Brightness temperature;Testing;Microwave measurements;Size measurement;Vegetation;Predictive models;Numerical simulation;Soil moisture","electromagnetic wave scattering;microwave measurement;radiative transfer;radiometry;remote sensing;soil;vegetation","microwave radiometry;first order scattering model;microwave brightness temperature data;deciduous tree canopies;Maryland;AD 2007;Paulownia trees;vegetation;tree ground truth;omega model;soil moisture","","2","","5","","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On Board Diagnostic (OBD) unit available in most of the modern vehicles is used to collect the driver and vehicle related parameters. OBD-to-Bluetooth dongle is used to extract the data via a mobile app. Mobile app then transfers the data to a backend consisting of a Complex Event Processor (CEP). Then the proposed system first performs a historical analysis of completed trips to identify a driver's behavior using a Markov model and k-Means clustering algorithms. Moreover, Adaboost algorithm is used for safe driver-behavior monitoring. Based on these the CEP engine identifies multiple parameters to generate and classify a driver's driving style. Once a deviation from the typical driving pattern is detected the user is alerted. Experimental results show the proposed system can achieve more than 90% accuracy under various driving simulations.","","978-1-5386-1676-5","10.1109/ICIINFS.2017.8300417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300417","Anomaly Detection;Driver Behavior Monitoring;OBD2","Vehicles;Markov processes;Engines;Acceleration;Real-time systems;Anomaly detection;Data models","Bluetooth;data acquisition;digital simulation;driver information systems;mobile computing;pattern clustering;road safety;road vehicles","safe driver-behavior monitoring;typical driving pattern;analytics system;real-time driver behavior monitoring;anomaly detection;distracted drivers;vehicular data acquisition;vehicle related parameters;OBD-to-Bluetooth dongle;mobile app;On Board Diagnostic unit;Complex Event Processor;CEP;Adaboost algorithm;driving simulations;k-Means clustering algorithms","","2","","8","","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we investigate whether practicing to modulate or regulate performance parameters, during practice of a virtual shuffleboard task, leads to better transfer of learning between tasks. Our results indicate that during practice, the parameter that was held constant improved the most during initial learning, and transferred best to a task requiring modulation of that parameter. Translation of this improvement into task performance depended upon the sensitivity of each task to changes in each variable. We conclude that during variable practice, learning to regulate, not modulate task variables leads to optimal learning and transfer.

Four scenes of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (L5TM) and Beijing-1 small satellite multispectral sensors (BJ1) images, acquired at different times, were selected to construct multisource and multiangle image data in this study. Considering a vertical distribution of forest LAI from both overstory and understory, a hybrid model of the invertible forest reflectance model (INFORM) was used to support the retrieval of forest LAI to eliminate the dependence of understory vegetation. The simulated data from INFORM outputs, added with a random noise, were first clustered by -means method, and were then trained by ANN to obtain the inversion model for each group (cluster). Next, the inversion model was applied to the different combinations of multiangle data to retrieve the forest LAI. Finally, a validation of inverted results with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LAI product and field measurements was conducted. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the inverted forest LAI can be improved through the addition of observation angle data, if the quality of the image data is ensured. The inversion accuracy of LAI with the multiangle image data is improved by 30% compared to the average accuracy of the inverted LAI with the single angle data after considering the addition of random noise to the ANN training data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2071416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5595002","Forest leaf area index (LAI);inversion;multisource and multiangle;radiative transfer model;remote sensing","Remote sensing;Vegetation mapping;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Sensors;Satellites;Optical imaging","geophysical signal processing;neural nets;radiative transfer;random noise;remote sensing;vegetation","radiative transfer model inversion;forest LAI;multisource optical remote sensing data;multiangular optical remote sensing data;leaf area index;means clustering;artificial neural network;Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper;L5TM image;Beijing-1 small satellite multispectral sensor;BJ1 image;invertible forest reflectance model;INFORM model;random noise;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","","31","","61","","7 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A scene simulator for optical hyperspectral and multispectral data has been implemented in the frame of the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) mission. EnMAP is a German-built hyperspectral space sensor scheduled for launch in 2012. EnMAP will measure in the 420-2450-nm spectral range at a varying spectral sampling of 6.5-10 nm. Images will cover 30 times 30 km areas at an approximate ground sampling distance of 30 m. The EnMAP scene simulator presented in this paper is able to generate realistic EnMAP-like data in an automatic way under a set of user-driven instrumental and scene parameters. Radiance and digital numbers data are generated by five sequential processing modules which are able to produce data over a range of natural environments, acquisition and illumination geometries, cloud covers, and instrument configurations. The latter include the simulation of data nonuniformity in the spatial and spectral domains, spatially coherent and noncoherent instrumental noise, and instrument's modulation transfer function. Realistic surface patterns for the simulated data are provided by existing remote-sensing data in different environments, from dry geological sites to green vegetation areas. A flexible radiative transfer simulation scheme enables the generation of different illumination, observation, and atmospheric conditions. The methodology applied to the complete scene simulation and some sample results are presented and analyzed in this paper.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2011616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4814515","Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP);imaging spectroscopy;instrumental noise;nonuniformity;radiative transfer;scene simulation","Remote sensing;Layout;Instruments;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Atmospheric modeling;Optical sensors;Analytical models;Image sampling;Lighting","image processing;optical transfer function;radiative transfer;remote sensing","remote-sensing image simulation;optical remote-sensing scenes;Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program;EnMAP hyperspectral mission;Earth Observation systems;data processing algorithms;German-built hyperspectral space sensor;AD 2012;ground sampling distance;digital numbers data;sequential processing modules;cloud covers;spatial domain;spectral domain;noncoherent instrumental noise;instrument's modulation transfer function;green vegetation areas;radiative transfer simulation scheme","","69","","45","","14 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The data calibration and pre-processing techniques have been widely studied in the remote sensing research. However, it was ignored that the most important factor affecting the results accuracy is the quality of the spectral data. To acquire such high spectral quality, the bi-directional reflection should be optimally adjusted during the data processing according to radiative transfer equation (RTE) based Hapke's model. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship of bi-directional reflectance (BRDF) correction on two crop (Canola and Wheat) varieties in the context of hyperspectral data robustness. The simulated dataset based on the radiative transfer parameters are used to evaluate the influence of source-sensor geometry, light illumination, and scattering on data quality and it's ability on data correction using proposed spectral similarity measures (SID-SAM score). The RTE-based BRDF optimization method (Hapke model) is proposed for improving the hyperspectral data quality after comparing with the uncorrected datasets. Simulated results shows that the optimization have significantly improved the data quality and increased the signal accuracy. Hence, the bi-directional reflectance correction would definitely have advantages on the hyperspectral data analysis to improve classification results.","2158-6276","978-1-7281-5294-3","10.1109/WHISPERS.2019.8920842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920842","Drone/UAS;Hyperspectral imaging;Spectral calibration;Bi-directional reflectance;Hapke model","Hyperspectral imaging;Scattering;Bidirectional control;Mathematical model;Agriculture;Data models","agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;calibration;data analysis;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;hyperspectral imaging;radiative transfer;remote sensing;spectral analysis","hyperspectral data analysis;hyperspectral data quality;RTE-based BRDF optimization method;spectral similarity measures;data correction;radiative transfer parameters;hyperspectral data robustness;radiative transfer equation;data processing;bi-directional reflection;high spectral quality;spectral data;remote sensing research;data calibration;UAV-based hyperspectral imaging;bi-directional reflectance correction","","","","20","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598879","Digital twin;deep transfer learning;fault diagnosis;smart manufacturing","Fault diagnosis;Data models;Manufacturing;Training data;Maintenance engineering;Predictive models;Solid modeling","fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;production engineering computing;virtual reality","deep transfer learning;digital twin;reliable diagnosis model;two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method;virtual space;data-based fault diagnosis methods;fidelity model;deep neural network based diagnosis model;smart manufacturing;DFDD;production process;real-time monitoring;predictive maintenance;DNN","","17","","51","","1 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, validated methods for the prediction of leaf carotenoid content relationships in forest canopies are still needed to date. This paper focuses on the simultaneous retrieval of chlorophyll (Cα + b) and (Cx + c) pigments, which are critical bioindicators of plant physiological status. Radiative transfer theory and modeling assumptions were applied at both laboratory and field scales to develop methods for their concurrent estimation using high-resolution hyperspectral imagery. The proposed methodology was validated based on the biochemical pigment quantification. Canopy modeling methods based on infinite reflectance formulations and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model were evaluated in relation to the PROSPECT-5 leaf model for the scaling-up procedure. Simpler modeling methods yielded comparable results to more complex 3-D approximations due to the high spatial resolution images acquired, which enabled targeting pure crowns and reducing the effects of canopy architecture. The scaling-up methods based on the PROSPECT-5+DART model yielded a root-mean-square error (RMSE) and a relative RMSE of 1.48 μg/cm2 (17.45%) and 5.03 μg/cm2 (13.25%) for Cx + c and Cα + b, respectively, while the simpler approach based on the PROSPECT-5+Hapke infinite reflectance model yielded 1.37 μg/cm2 (17.46%) and 4.71 μg/cm2 (14.07%) for Cx + c and Cα+b, respectively. These predictive algorithms proved to be useful to estimate Cα + b and Cx + c from high-resolution hyperspectral imagery, providing a methodology for the monitoring of these photosynthetic pigments in conifer forest canopies.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2287304","DIVERBOS; University of Córdoba-Campus de Excelencia (Campus de Excelencia Internacional Agroalimentario¿CEIA3); Spanish Ministry of Science and Education (MEC) through the AGL2009-13105 project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705680","Airborne;carotenoids;chlorophyll;conifers;forest;hyperspectral;$ \hbox{R}_{515}/\hbox{R}_{570}$;$\hbox{R}_{750}/ \hbox{R}_{710}$;scaling up;transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI)/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI);Airborne;carotenoids;chlorophyll;conifers;forest;hyperspectral;$\hbox{R}_{515}/\hbox{R}_{570}$;$\hbox{R}_{750}/\hbox{R}_{710}$;scaling up;transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI)/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI)","Pigments;Vegetation mapping;Needles;Indexes;Hyperspectral imaging;Solid modeling","geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;radiative transfer;remote sensing;vegetation mapping","high spatial resolution images;targeting pure crowns;canopy architecture effect reduction;scaling-up methods;PROSPECT-5+DART model;root-mean-square error;relative RMSE;simpler approach;PROSPECT-5+Hapke infinite reflectance model;predictive algorithms;photosynthetic pigment monitoring methodlogy;complex 3-D approximations;simpler modeling methods;scaling-up procedure;PROSPECT-5 leaf model;discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model;infinite reflectance formulations;canopy modeling methods;biochemical pigment quantification;high-resolution hyperspectral imagery;method development;field scale;laboratory scale;modeling assumptions;radiative transfer theory;plant physiological status;critical bioindicators;simultaneous chlorophyll pigment retrieval;leaf carotenoid content relationship prediction;validated methods;structural effects;conifer forest canopies;model simulation;canopy level;carotenoid content predictive relationships","","19","","37","","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The path radiance should be estimated and subtracted from each band before the product by Pan is accomplished and added back after. Both empirical and model-based estimation techniques of MS path radiances are compared within the framework of optimized SVR and HPM algorithms.

The protocol is based on Entry Consistency but, unlike previous approaches, does not require the explicit association of shared data to synchronization variables, uses the page as its coherence unit, and generates the set of modifications (in the form of diffs) made to shared pages eagerly. The AEC protocol hides the overhead of generating and applying diffs behind synchronization delays, and uses a novel technique, Lock Acquirer Prediction (LAP), to tolerate the overhead of transferring diffs through the network. LAP attempts to predict the next acquirer of a lock at the time of the release, so that the acquirer can be updated even before requesting ownership of the lack. Using execution-driven simulation of real applications, we show that LAP performs very well under AEC; LAP predictions are within the 80-97% range of accuracy. Our results also show that LAP improves performance by 7-28% for our applications. In addition we find that most of the diff creation overhead in the AEC protocol can usually be overlapped with synchronization latencies. A comparison against simulated TreadMarks shows that AEC outperforms TreadMarks by as much as 47%. We conclude that LAP is a useful technique for improving the performance of update-based SW-DSMs, while AEC is an efficient implementation of the Entry Consistency model.","0190-3918","0-8186-8108-X","10.1109/ICPP.1997.622646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=622646","","Protocols;Delay;Systems engineering and theory;Modeling;Disruption tolerant networking;Predictive models;Programming profession;Hardware;Workstations;Operating systems","synchronisation;protocols;shared memory systems;distributed memory systems;delays;digital simulation","affinity entry consistency protocol;software-only distributed shared memory system;shared data;synchronization delays;lock acquirer prediction;synchronization latencies;simulated TreadMarks;entry consistency model","","10","","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When generating the database, the evaluation of the associated modeling uncertainties is crucial for retrieval error estimation. However, this is extremely complex due to the large number of free parameters. In this work, a possible methodology for taking into account CRD-related modeling uncertainties is proposed. The methodology-fairly general-is here applied to a limited dataset (a cloud-model resolved numerical output of a tropical cyclone). The modeling errors are obtained from systematic TB sensitivity tests associated to several parameters: particle sizes, temperature, ice content, sea surface wind speed, viewing angle, footprint size, radiative transfer schemes, melting phase, and particle shape. TB uncertainties are eventually summarized in a modeling error covariance matrix representing the intrinsic variability of the generated CRD. For comparison with real observations, the TBs are simulated at the spatial resolution, viewing geometry and frequencies of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). The matrix is evaluated with respect to TMI data in terms of an indicator called database matching index. Since they are based on a single case study and suffer from the lack of direct coupling of the radiative transfer with the cloud-resolving model, the provided results should not be considered an exhaustive evaluation of cloud-radiation modeling errors. Nevertheless, they may be considered a valuable starting point for error characterization, since extensions to larger databases could definitely improve modeling error budgets.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.860484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564397","Error modeling;estimation uncertainties;retrieval","Uncertainty;Databases;Information retrieval;Ocean temperature;Covariance matrix;Microwave theory and techniques;Clouds;Brightness temperature;Error analysis;Tropical cyclones","atmospheric techniques;rain;atmospheric radiation;data acquisition;clouds;radiative transfer;remote sensing;microwave measurement","modeling uncertainty;passive microwave precipitation retrieval;microwave spaceborne technique;rainfall retrieval;simulated cloud radiation database;cloud profile;brightness temperature;cloud-model resolved numerical output;tropical cyclone;modeling error covariance matrix;Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager;database matching index;radiative transfer;cloud-resolving model","","11","","48","","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, this method is improved for better applicability to ASTER/TIR imagery. The major improvement is the determination of a water vapor scaling factor on a band-by-band basis, which can reduce most of the errors induced by various factors such as algorithm assumptions. Next, the WVS method is validated by assessing the surface temperature and emissivity retrieved for a global-based simulation model (416 448 conditions), 183 ASTER scenes selected globally, and ASTER scenes from two test sites, Hawaii Island and Tokyo Bay. In situ lake surface temperatures measured in 13 vicarious calibration experiments, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sea surface temperature products, and a climatic lake temperature are also used in validation. All the results indicate that although the ASTER/TIR standard atmospheric correction algorithm performs less well in humid conditions, the WVS method will provide more accurate retrieval of surface temperature and emissivity in most conditions including notably humid conditions. The expected root mean square error is about 0.6 K in temperature. Since the WVS method will be degraded by errors in gray pixel selection and cloud detection, these processing steps should be applied accurately.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.857886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542349","Global data assimilation system (GDAS);gray pixel;MODTRAN;multichannel algorithm;radiative transfer;surface emissivity;surface temperature;validation","Infrared imaging;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Layout;Lakes;Temperature measurement;Infrared spectra;Algorithm design and analysis;Reflection;Radiometry","remote sensing;geophysical signal processing;data acquisition;data assimilation;radiometry;microwave measurement;calibration;infrared imaging;image processing;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric humidity;clouds;ocean temperature;lakes;oceanographic techniques;radiative transfer","ASTER thermal infrared imagery;WVS method;water vapor scaling;atmospheric correction algorithm;thermal infrared multispectral data;TIR multispectral data;TIR spectral band;Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer;Terra satellite;ASTER/TIR imagery;Hawaii Island;Tokyo Bay;USA;Japan;lake surface temperature;vicarious calibration experiments;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;sea surface temperature;climatic lake temperature;root mean square error;gray pixel selection;cloud detection;global data assimilation system;GDAS;MODTRAN;multichannel algorithm;radiative transfer;surface emissivity","","64","","41","","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data fusion is a means to synthesize MS images at higher spatial resolution than original by exploiting the high spatial resolution of the PAN. This process is often called pansharpening. The synthesis property states that the synthesized MS images should be as close as possible to those that would have been acquired by the corresponding sensors if they had this high resolution. The methods based on the concept Amélioration de la Résolution Spatiale par Injection de Structures (ARSIS) are able to deliver synthesized images with good spectral quality but whose geometrical quality can still be improved. We propose a more precise definition of the synthesis property in terms of geometry. Then, we present a method that takes explicitly into account the difference in modulation transfer function (MTF) between PAN and MS in the fusion process. This method is applied to an existing ARSIS-based fusion method, i.e., A trou wavelet transform-model 3.

This is true if accurate radiometric calibrations of the sensor are performed and atmospheric effects on the acquired data are carefully accounted for. In order to obtain spectral surface reflectance maps from the at-sensor radiance images, an improved atmospheric correction procedure have to be implemented. The availability of data acquired at high spectral resolution allows the detection of different spectral features of many atmospheric constituents. An iterative estimation algorithm based on high resolution data has been developed using the MODTRAN 5 radiative transfer code. The default atmospheric profiles available in that code have been firstly refined through at-ground level measurements of some parameters, like temperature, pressure, humidity, and solar irradiance. Then an iterative procedure has been started tuning the abundance of some atmospheric gases and of aerosol. The MODTRAN 5 code is executed several times with different atmospheric parameters (H2O, CO2, CO, O3, and aerosol abundances) until the calculated ground irradiance matches the in-field measurements and the estimated ground spectral reflectance map is free from the related spectral signatures. To test and validate the method both simulated at-sensor radiance images have been utilized. First results are presented and discussed taking into account the feasibility of avoiding in-field measurements.","2153-7003","978-1-4244-3394-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5418004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5418004","Atmospheric correction;Imaging spectrometers;Remote sensing;Hyper spectral images;Environmental monitoring","Iterative methods;Image resolution;High-resolution imaging;Spectroscopy;Radiometry;Reflectivity;Aerosols;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Earth","atmospheric optics;geophysical techniques;iterative methods;radiative transfer;radiometry;remote sensing","atmospheric correction iterative method;high spectral resolution aerospace imaging spectrometer;aerospace optical imagers;Earth observation;radiometric calibrations;atmospheric effects;spectral surface reflectance maps;at-sensor radiance images;MODTRAN 5 radiative transfer code;atmospheric water vapour;aerosol abundances;ground irradiance","","","","12","","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a simple versus a complex VE on motor learning of a novel balance task in typically developing (TD) children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). In addition, we explored the relationship between children's motivation, engagement and their motor learning outcomes in each VE. Twenty-seven TD children and 6 children with hemiplegic or diplegic CP participated. Participants were randomized to practice the same novel postural control task in either a simple or a complex flat-screen display VE. Motor learning was measured by an error metric per trial. Following 40 acquisition trials, children completed motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and engagement (User Engagement Scale) measures. They returned 2-7 days later for retention and transfer tests. Children with CP had significantly greater performance errors as compared to TD children at all sessions; however, there was no difference in performance between simple and complex VE conditions at any session, nor were there any differences in engagement or motivation between conditions or groups. Lower self-reported motivation was associated with greater performance error at retention and transfer in all participants.

For a given distribution of ground reflectance and for a specific profile of scattering and absorption properties of the atmosphere, the spectral response of the sensor is obtained in a short time from the results of the Monte Carlo simulation by using scaling relationships and symmetry properties. The procedure also includes an accurate analysis of the adjacency and trapping effects due to multiple scattering of photons coming from neighboring pixels. McCART can generate synthetic images of the Earth's surface for arbitrary viewing conditions.

In order to obtain a good design and manufacturing result, it is necessary to equip the designer and manufacturer with a support system related to casting design or so called, knowledge transfer and creation system. In recent years, the design supporting system using VR technology is developed, and introduced in the manufacturing industry. The merit of using VR system is being able to carry out the stereoscopy of the product model drawn by 3D CAD, and to carry out the design review of the product model in the same size as thing. However, since many systems extend the display of the conventional 3D CAD, they cannot input annotation and so on directly in VR environment. In this paper, the system which can input and display the annotation in VR environment is developed.

The database contains 382 radiosonde profiles acquired over land, with nearly-uniform distribution of precipitable water between 0 and 5.5 cm. Radiative transfer calculations were performed with the MODTRAN 4 code. Different viewing angles were considered in the simulation, taking into account the features of each sensor. The viewing capability of AATSR, with near simultaneous observations first at a forward angle (55deg from nadir) and then close to nadir, allows the implementation of DA algorithms. Using the simulation database, SW algorithms adapted for MODIS and AATSR data, and DA algorithms for AATSR data were developed. Both types of algorithms are quadratic in the brightness temperature difference, and depend explicitly on the land surface emissivity. A sensitivity analysis of all algorithms was made to obtain estimation of the algorithm errors. Furthermore the SW and DA algorithms developed from the simulation database were validated with actual ground measurements of LST collected, concurrently to MODIS and AATSR observations, in a site located close to the city of Valencia, Spain, in a large, flat and thermally homogeneous area of rice crops, where field campaigns were held during the summers of 2002-2006.

One proposed mechanism is via enhanced user engagement and/or motivation, which may directly influence the quality of motor memory consolidation. The objectives of this study were to a) compare children's motor learning of the same novel postural reaching task in a VE versus a PE; b) evaluate differences in engagement and motivation between the two practice environments; and c) explore the relationships between practice environment, engagement, motivation, and motor learning. Thirty-six typically developing children aged 7-13 years were randomized to acquire a novel postural reaching skill in either a 2D flat-screen VE or a PE. Skin conductance level (SCL) was measured on the non-task hand during practice. Following acquisition, children completed a language-modified User Engagement Scale (UES) and the Pediatric Motivation Inventory (PMOT). Participants returned 1-7 days later for retention (same environment) and transfer (opposite environment) tests. Children who practiced in the VE demonstrated greater retention, as evidenced by higher mean scores on the retention test (t[30] = -3.72, p = 0.001, partial eta squared 0.28). Children who practiced in the PE demonstrated greater transfer to the opposite environment as compared to those who practiced in the VE (t[30] = 2.05, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.238). There were no significant differences in UES total or subscale scores between the 2 groups. PMOT total motivation scores differed significantly between groups, favoring the VE (t[30]= 2.49, p = 0.018, partial eta squared = 0.154). There were no significant differences in SCL peak count or peaks per minute between groups. There was no relationship between engagement, motivation, and retention or transfer performance. Findings suggest that retention but not transfer of a new motor skill may be facilitated by practice in a VE. This may be due to unique task demands in each environment. Children were more motivated to succeed in the VE and were engaged in the task in both environments, suggesting that both constructs should be measured in subsequent studies and that VE aesthetics alone may not be a key `active ingredient' of children's engagement.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefit of a BIODIVERSITY-like sensor to determine the bio-optical properties of the water column, namely the Chlorophyll-a concentration, the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration, the absorption coefficient of the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), the bathymetry and the composition of the seabed, according to its spatial resolution and spectral resolution and its signal to noise ratio. For this purpose, radiative transfer simulations are analyzed together with remote sensing hyperspectral airborne data acquired above the Porquerolles Island (France). The retrieval performance of all in-water and seabed parameters derived from the inversion of BIODIVERSITY-like data is compared with the performance obtained using ENMAP and HICO spatial and radiometric specifications. It is shown that a BIODIVERSITY-like sensor significantly improves the estimation performance of the water column parameters. Furthermore, BIODIVERSITY-like sensor is highly appropriate for seabed mapping when bottom pixels are composed of pure material (e.g., Sand or Posidonia) in shallow waters when seabed depth is less than 10 m. Conversely, the performance of the inversion deteriorates when seabed pixels are composed of mixed materials (e.g., Sand mixed with Posidonia). It is also shown that the concentration of chlorophyll, SPM and CDOM absorption are less sensitive to noise level than depth and seabed abundance.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3031729","French Spatial National Agency; French Research Agency; French Defense Agency; HypFoM; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234693","Bathymetry;hyperspectral;ocean color;radiative transfer;seabed mapping","Hyperspectral imaging;Sea measurements;Water;Reflectivity;Spatial resolution","bathymetry;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;oceanographic techniques;radiative transfer;remote sensing;sand","coastal ocean environmental mapping;ENMAP;BIODIVERSITY-like sensor;bio-optical properties;Chlorophyll-a concentration;suspended particulate matter concentration;colored dissolved organic matter;spatial resolution;remote sensing hyperspectral airborne data;seabed parameters;BIODIVERSITY-like data;radiometric specifications;water column parameters;seabed mapping;shallow waters;seabed depth;seabed pixels;seabed abundance;potential future hyperspectral satellite sensor;coastal zones;coastal ocean;hyperspectral imager;hyperspectral satellite sensors","","","","48","CCBY","21 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use MAW (multidimensional audio windows), a NeXT-based system, as a binaural directional mixing console. Since the rearrangement of a dynamic map is used to dynamically select transfer functions, a user may specify the virtual location of a sound source, throwing the source into perceptual space, using exocentric graphical control to drive egocentric auditory display. As a concept demonstration, we muted a telephone, and then used MAW to spatialize a ringing signal at its location, putting the sonic image of the phone into the office environment. By juxtaposing and mixing 'real' and 'synthetic' audio transmissions, we are exploring the relationship between acoustic telepresence and VR presentations: telepresence manifests as the actual configuration of sources in a sound field, as perceivable by a dummyhead; VR is the perception yielded by filtering of virtual sources with respect to virtual sinks.

In this article, a new approach based on deep learning is proposed that allows the estimation of CWV without the knowledge of the atmospheric visibility, the solar zenith angle, and the atmospheric point spread function (PSF). The proposed approach includes a training strategy based on synthetic data that are generated according to an accurate radiative-transfer model, and by exploiting reflectance spectral libraries and the MODTRAN radiative-transfer code. Experiments on simulated data are carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed deep neural network with reference to both aerial and satellite applications.

We developed a 1-D model (the path length correction (PLC)based model) for simulating CR over sloping terrain. The effects of sloping terrain on single-order and diffuse scatterings are accounted for by PLC and modification of the fraction of incoming diffuse irradiance, respectively. The PLC model was validated via both Monte Carlo and remote sensing image simulations. The comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the PLC model can capture the pattern of slopeinduced reflectance distortion with high accuracy (red band: R2 = 0.88; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.0045; relative RMSE (RRMSE) = 15%; near infrared response (NIR) band: R2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.041; RRMSE = 16%). The comparison of the PLC-simulated results with remote sensing observations acquired by the Landsat8-OLI sensor revealed an accuracy similar to that with the Monte Carlo simulation (red band: R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.0053; RRMSE = 13%; NIR band: R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.023; RRMSE = 8%). To further validate the PLC model, we used it to implement topographic normalization; the results showed a large reduction in topographic effects after normalization, which implied that the PLC model captures reflectance variations caused by terrain.

Component temperatures inversion and leaf area index (LAI) inversion all have close relations with the vegetation fraction cover. The objective of this study is to develop a method to estimate the vegetation cover fraction from satellite observation. Traditional methods of inferring vegetation fraction cover from satellite remote sensing include spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and scaled normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Those methods often rely on a series of steps in the processing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular correction and so on. Generally, those procedures are very computationally demanding. In addition, the errors associated with each procedure may be accumulated and significantly affect to the accuracy of the final products. In this study, a new retrieval methodology is proposed to calculate vegetation fraction cover over mixed pixels directly from the AATSR spectral reflectance data at top-of-atmosphere (TOA). The method consists of extensive radiative transfer simulations under a wide variety of solar illumination and sensor view conditions, atmospheric profiles, aerosol types and conditions and vegetation canopy leaf angle distributions. The derivation of vegetation fraction cover from TOA observations requires several steps of processing.Important steps include, (1) Preparing for the model input variables: foliage and soil spectral data on red, green and near-infrared bands which measured from two kinds of vegetation and three kinds of soil in the field experiment; (2) Generating a database based on a canopy radiative transfer model, Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL), and a hybrid linear model with the spectral data combined with vegetation geometric construction data and observation geometric data; (3)Atmospheric correction that converts surface ensemble reflectance to TOA ensemble reflectance based on a radiative transfer model, Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar (6S); (4) Mapping the relationships between spectral directional ensemble reflectance and vegetation fraction cover through a nonlinear regress method. The correction coefficients of the surface vegetation fraction cover computed with AATSR are provided.vegetation fraction cover retrieval from TOA data of AATSR does not exceed by 6% at nadir view and 9.7% at forward view, respectively. The performances of input parameters on estimates of vegetation fraction cover are given compared with the ""true"" surface vegetation fraction cover. The aim of estimating vegetation fraction cover is to prepare for inversing component temperatures using AATSR data, in which process vegetation fraction cover is an important parameter.","2153-7003","978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779304","Vegetation fraction cover;AATSR;TOA spectral data;Radiative transfer simulations;EVI","Vegetation mapping;Solid modeling;Reflectivity;Satellites;Remote sensing;Information retrieval;Atmospheric modeling;Soil;Temperature sensors;Spectral analysis","atmospheric boundary layer;geophysical techniques;radiative transfer;remote sensing;vegetation","directional vegetation fraction cover;remote sensing inversion;component temperatures inversion;leaf area index inversion;spectral mixture analysis;SMA;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index;NDVI;atmospheric correction;surface angular correction;AATSR spectral reflectance data;top-of-atmosphere;TOA ensemble reflectance;solar illumination;sensor view conditions;aerosol types;aerosol conditions;vegetation canopy leaf angle distributions;foliage spectral data;red band;green band;near-infrared band;canopy radiative transfer model;Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves;SAIL;hybrid linear model;vegetation geometric construction data;Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar;nonlinear regress method;soil spectral data","","","","7","","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-frame techniques, such as microscanning, are an effective means of reducing aliasing and increasing resolution in images produced by staring imaging systems. These techniques involve interlacing a set of image frames that have been shifted with respect to each other during acquisition. The FLIR system is mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft, and the vibrations associated with the platform are used to generate the shifts. Since a fixed number of image frames is required, and the shifts are random, the acquired frames will not fall on a uniformly spaced grid. Furthermore, some of the acquired frames may have almost similar shifts thus making them unusable for high-resolution image reconstruction. In this paper, we utilize a gradient-based registration algorithm to estimate the shifts between the acquired frames and then use a weighted nearest-neighbor approach for placing the frames onto a uniform grid to form a final high-resolution image. Blurring by the detector and optics of the imaging system limits the increase in image resolution when microscanning is attempted at sub-pixel movements of less than half the detector width. We resolve this difficulty by the application of the Wiener filter, designed using the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging system, to the high-resolution image. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The techniques proposed herein are significantly faster than alternate techniques, and are found to be especially suitable for real-time applications.","1557-9662","","10.1109/19.872908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=872908","","Infrared imaging;Image registration;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging;Infrared detectors;Sensor arrays;Image sampling;Frequency","image reconstruction;image resolution;optical transfer function;infrared detectors;image sensors;digital simulation;real-time systems;image registration;infrared imaging;filtering theory;Wiener filters","IR image registration;high-resolution reconstruction;multiple translationally shifted aliased video frames;forward looking IR detector arrays;spatially undersampled images;microscanning;interlacing;moving platform;aircraft;vibrations;random;high-resolution image reconstruction;gradient-based registration algorithm;weighted nearest-neighbor approach;uniform grid;blurring;Wiener filter;modulation transfer function;high-resolution image;real-time applications;FLIR;aliasing;sub-pixel;Nyquist sampling","","104","2","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It would be highly desirable to be able to estimate this parameter on the basis of satellite remote sensing data in the optical spectral range. However, LAI affects the propagation of light in a plant canopy (and therefore its measurable reflectance factor) exclusively through a boundary condition of the equation of radiation transfer. It is shown that LAI may be retrievable accurately and reliably only when the canopy is optically thin enough to allow a significant illumination of the underlying soil, and when the optical properties of this soil are such that the radiance field emerging from this level is sufficiently different from that which would be exhibited by a deeper canopy. The combinations of radiative conditions (soil and plant properties) necessary for the reliable and accurate retrieval of the LAI on the basis of remote sensing reflectance data acquired above the canopy in the red and near-infrared spectral regions are investigated and documented with the help of simulation studies.

It is necessary to appropriately perform this processing in order to benefit from reference imageries of surface temperature (T) and emissivity (ε) maps retrieved from thermal infrared data. In particular, ε images generated from T/ε separation algorithms show undesirable noise that jeopardizes their photointerpretation. This letter addresses the following: 1) the removal of view-angle-dependent atmospheric effects by using ratio techniques for deriving atmospheric water vapor content in a pixel-by-pixel basis and atmospheric radiative transfer simulations to construct lookup tables (LUTs) and 2) the removal of image stripping using maximum/minimum noise fraction (MNF) transforms. For this purpose, imagery acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) sensor has been used. Results show that angular effects in the atmospheric correction can be addressed from AHS-derived water vapor content and LUTs, whereas due to the AHS noise specific characteristics, the MNF transform only removed part of the noise.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2011.2163699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016207","Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS);emissivity;minimum noise fraction (MNF);temperature and emissivity separation (TES);thermal infrared (TIR)","Noise;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Transforms;Sensors;Hyperspectral sensors","atmospheric humidity;data acquisition;geophysical image processing;image denoising;infrared imaging;radiative transfer;remote sensing;temperature measurement","surface emissivity retrieval;airborne multispectral imager;very high spatial resolution data acquisition;satellite data;image acquisition;data processing;view-angle-dependent atmospheric correction;stripping-based noise removal;stripping-based noise minimization;surface temperature map;emissivity map;thermal infrared data;photointerpretation;ratio technique;atmospheric water vapor content;pixel-by-pixel basis;atmospheric radiative transfer simulation;lookup table;maximum-minimum noise fraction;Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner sensor","","13","1","16","","12 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

VSFs of multiple scattering planes between angular range 20° to 160° are achieved simultaneously. We tested the setup with polystyrene spheres of 5 different sizes (diameter 57,193,362,528 and 809nm).

It is a challenging task requiring advanced skills including the ability to precisely control the movement of a micropipette. Developing these skills requires both lengthy and intensive training, and significant practical experience. This paper extends upon our previous work in desktop Virtual Reality (VR) cell injection training to introduce a large-scale VR micro-robotic cell injection system. Through utilization of large visual displays and the large workspace INCA 6D haptic device, the proprioception related to large arm movements (and corresponding visual representation) and the resulting movement of the micropipette in relation to the cell aims to provide the user with a better understanding of the spatial relationship between the micropipette and cell. The haptic device can be operated either with or without haptic guidance. When enabled, haptic guidance is provided in the form of virtual fixtures (VFs) and force feedback to assist the user in following the ideal trajectory towards the penetration point, applying appropriate force for penetration and stopping the micropipette's tip at the suitable deposition point. A user evaluation was conducted to study the usability of the system. Eighteen participants took part in the experiments and were randomly divided into six groups based on the display and haptic guidance modes assigned. The results demonstrated that the large-scale VR micro-robotic cell injection system is a feasible and effective method for bio-operator training where it is suggested that the skills and knowledge acquired can be transferred to the real-world task.","","978-1-8893-3551-3","10.1109/WAC.2016.7583006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7583006","Micro-robot;cell injection;virtual reality;haptics;skill training","Image edge detection;Visualization;Robots","computer based training;haptic interfaces;large-scale systems;medical computing;medical robotics;microrobots;virtual reality","large-scale virtual reality;microrobotic cell injection training;bio-operators;micropipette;intensive training;INCA 6D haptic device;virtual fixtures;VF;user evaluation","","3","","18","","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, by categorizing the land surface into three types, the NSSR was estimated under clear and cloudy skies separately based on the relationship between TOA broadband albedo and the Earth's surface absorbed shortwave radiation. The estimation error of the absorption coefficient for each land type is lower than 0.05. Finally, by employing a look-up-table acquired in the process of narrowband-to-broadband conversion, and the parameters in the NSSR estimation model for each land type, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated, where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 25.85 (13.97) W/m2, 20.39 (7.97) W/m2, and 40.54 (11.26) W/m2 for land, ocean and snow/ice surfaces for clear (cloudy) skies, respectively.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899144","Net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR);Gaofen-5 (GF-5);albedo;narrowband-to-broadband conversion","Land surface;Sea surface;Atmospheric modeling;Broadband communication;Estimation;Clouds","albedo;atmospheric optics;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;mean square error methods;radiative transfer;remote sensing","net surface shortwave radiation;simulated Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite data;surface energy budget;GF-5;TOA broadband albedo;land surface;Earth's surface;estimation error;land type;narrowband-to-broadband conversion;NSSR estimation model;clear and cloudy skies;absorbed shortwave radiation;root mean square errors","","","","12","","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly critical when working with time series of data. Atmospheric correction strategies based on radiative transfer codes may provide a rigorous solution but it may not be the best solution for situations where a huge amount of hyperspectral images may need to be processed and computational time is a critical factor. The GMES (¿Global Monitoring for Environment and Security¿) initiative has promoted the creation of a new generation of satellites (the SENTINEL series) with ¿ultra-high resolution¿ and ¿superspectral imaging¿ capabilities. Therefore, there is an urgent need to quickly and reliably compensate for changes in the atmospheric transmittance and varying solar illumination conditions. In this paper three different forms of affine transformation models (general, particular and diagonal) are considered as candidates for rapid compensation of illumination variations. They are tested on a series of simulated multispectral images of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance, where the surface is a synthetic scene of a test site in Spain called Barrax, where reference data for validation is available. The results indicate that in 2 of the more moderate Sun positions, for all the Visibilities tested, the particular affine method is better than the other 2. The results also indicate that the proposed methodology is satisfactory for practical normalization of varying illumination and atmospheric conditions in remotely sensed images required for operational or time critical applications.","2153-7003","978-1-4244-3394-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5418059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5418059","Affine;illumination compensation;hyperspectral","Lighting;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Testing;Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;Optical sensors;Solar power generation;Image resolution","atmospheric radiation;data acquisition;geophysical techniques;radiative transfer;remote sensing;sunlight","affine compensation;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optical satellite;airborne images;data acquisition time;atmospheric correction;radiative transfer codes;GMES;Global Monitoring for Environment and Security;SENTINEL series;atmospheric transmittance;solar illumination condition;top-of-atmosphere radiance;Spain;Barrax","","1","","10","","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore in this research, a method based on Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) concept has been employed to identify and control dynamic systems. Online identification using Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) models is used to identify the transfer function of the system; the controller is tuned on the identified model in a simulation environment and applied to the real system. The advantages of the proposed method are high accuracy in the identified system, simplicity, and low cost. Two case studies, namely, a DC motor and servo-pneumatic system, were used to verify the proposed method.","","978-1-4244-2205-0","10.1109/SSD.2008.4632896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632896","","Predictive models;Transfer functions;Computational modeling;Control systems;DC motors;Tuning;Mathematical model","autoregressive moving average processes;computerised control;control system CAD;digital simulation;identification;mechatronics;transfer functions","on-line identification method;hardware-in-the-loop concept;mechatronic system control;real time environment;system transfer function;HIL;dynamic system control;autoregressive moving average model;ARMA;DC motor;servo-pneumatic system;controller design;software-in-the-loop","","","","9","","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, very few studies to date have examined the demand-side knowledge perspective such as knowledge acquisition in virtual communities. In order to explore the knowledge acquisition process within virtual communities, this study proposes the cognitive selection framework of knowledge acquisition strategy in virtual communities. The proposed framework identifies how knowledge recipients select their strategy for acquiring specialized knowledge, emphasizing cognitive perspectives such as cognitive goals (cognitive replication and innovation) and cognitive motivators (virtual community self-efficacy, heightened enjoyment, and time resources) at the individual level. On analyzing the preliminary data, we obtain findings that suggest that knowledge recipients' cognitive motivators differentially influence their cognitive goals for selecting knowledge acquisition strategy. However, in order to empirically examine the hypotheses identified in this study, further research is still needed.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-5510-2","10.1109/HICSS.2010.368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428500","","Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge management;Knowledge transfer;Data analysis;Technological innovation;US Government;Social network services;IP networks;Testing;Web design","innovation management;knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;virtual reality","cognitive selection;knowledge acquisition strategy;virtual communities;knowledge management;cognitive goals;cognitive replication;innovation;cognitive motivators;virtual community self-efficacy;heightened enjoyment;time resources","","4","","48","","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

User interaction via haptic stimuli within the VE is still unexplored for developing the BMI however, due to little understanding of cognitive processes related to such haptic interaction. Hence, we investigated a feasibility of estimating cognitive processes related to haptic interaction. Involved in the investigation, human participants undertook a task via different haptic stimuli (e.g., force and vibration) within a 3D VE . Their brain activities evoked by the stimuli were acquired as electroencephalography signals. Patterns of event-related potential and power spectral density were extracted from the signals, indicating activation in certain brain areas. The estimation of connectivity among these areas used directed transfer function, emphasizing on the middle of the β band (1/030 Hz) in the signals. The emphasis was due to the band's association with active focus and thinking. We found that, while behavioral differences were unapparent, all vibration-related stimuli yielded distinct active brain areas and connectivity to form certain cognitive processes. The finding implied a potential of localizing the processes for BMI-based haptic interaction.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-4569-3","10.1109/SMC.2019.8913853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8913853","electroencephalography (EEG);brain-machine interface (BMI);haptic interaction;virtual environment (VE)","Electroencephalography;Conferences;Cybernetics;Brain-computer interfaces;Haptic interfaces;Virtual environments;Data collection","bioelectric potentials;brain-computer interfaces;cognition;electroencephalography;haptic interfaces;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;virtual reality","active brain areas;vibration-related stimuli;directed transfer function;electroencephalography signals;brain activity;haptic stimuli;user interaction;visual tasks;3D virtual environment;brain-machine interface;BMI-based haptic interaction;cognitive process;power spectral density;event-related potential;frequency 1.0 Hz;frequency 30.0 Hz","","","","24","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, discipline concepts cannot usually be introduced to students all at once.

This often results in inadequate comprehension of the disciplinepsilas ldquobig picturerdquo - that is, the interrelationship of various concepts, models and behaviours. Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.","2161-377X","978-0-7695-3167-0","10.1109/ICALT.2008.136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561654","learning;computer simulator;thinking;holistic picture","Computational modeling;Systems engineering and theory;Circuit simulation;Computer simulation;Computer displays;Knowledge engineering;Education;Electronic circuits;Linear circuits;Steady-state","computer aided instruction;digital simulation;educational courses;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;Internet;transfer functions","4Screens Web-based simulator;electronic system behaviour;algebraic transfer function;educational course;student learning;electronic engineering education","","1","","11","","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is achieved by comparing measured SAR image spectra with simulated ones which are computed from measured ocean waveheight spectra. SAR simulations are carried out by taking the nondimensional modulus, |M/sup RAR/|, and phase, /spl etasup RAR/, of the MTF as free parameters. The phase, /spl etasup RAR/, is defined in such a way that it is positive in front of the wave crest and negative behind the wave crest in the reference system of the long ocean wave. Best agreement is achieved when using the following values for |M/sup RAR/| and /spl etasup RAR/: |M/sup RAR/|=8-15 (VV and HH polarization), /spl etasup RAR/=60/spl deg/-90/spl deg/ for the case that the wind is blowing in the direction of the long ocean waves, and /spl etasup RAR/=0/spl deg/-60/spl deg/ for the case that the wind is blowing against this direction.<>","","0-7803-1385-2","10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=326206","","Transfer functions;Synthetic aperture radar;Ocean waves;Hydrodynamics;Extraterrestrial measurements;Sea measurements;L-band;Computational modeling;Polarization;Degradation","ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing by radar;remote sensing;electromagnetic wave scattering;radar cross-sections;backscatter","SHF UHF;ocean wave sea surface;radar remote sensing;measurement technique;radar scattering;microwave decimetric;SAR;modulation transfer function;synthetic aperture radar imagery;X-band;C-band;L-band;North Sea;SAXON;FPN;waveheight","","","","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
